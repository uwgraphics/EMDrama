AMYNTAS OR THE IMPOSSIBLE DOVVRY.

A PASTORAL ACTED before the KING and QUEEN at White Hall.

Written by THOMAS RANDOLPH.

Pastorem, Tityre, pingues Pascere oportet oves, diductum dicere Carmen.

OXFORD,

Printed by Leonard Lichfield, for Francis Bowman. 1638.

The Scene Sicilie, in the holy Vale.

The time an Astrologicall day from Noone to Noone.

I Will speak the Prologue.


Then you do me wrong.


Why, dare your Sex compare with ours for Tongue?


A Female Prologue!


Yes, as well as Male.


That Is a new trick;


And the other is as stale.


Men are more eloquent then women made*


But women are more powrfull to persuade.


It seems so; for I dare no more contend.


Then best give ore the strife, and make an end.


I will not yield.


Shall we divide it then?


You to the Women speak.


You to the Men.


Gentlemen, look not from us Rural swains
For polished speech, high lines, or Courtly strains:
Expect not we should bring a labored Scene,
Or complements; we ken not what they mean.

And Ladies, we poor Country Girls do come
With such behavior as we learned at home.
How shall we talk to Nymphs so trim and gay,
That nere saw Lady yet but at a May?

His Muse is very bashful, should you throw
A Snake into her Cradle, I do know
She is no Hercules to outlive your Ire:

One Hiss would make the fearful fool expire,
Without a sting.

Gentlemen do but you
Like this, no matter what the Women do.

It was a saucy Swain thus to conclude!
Ladies, the Gentlemen are not so rude,
If they were ever schooled by powrefull love,
As to dislike the things you shall approve.
If you but like him 'twill be greater praise
Then if each Muse of Nine had fetched him Baies.

It Is news Laurinda that will ravish you!


How, ravish me? if it be such desperate news
I pray conceal it*

So I will.


Nay Dorylas,
Pray tell it though.

It Is desperate news,


But prithee do.


I must conceal it.


Do not.


Mistress, you have prevailed: I will relate it.


No matter though whether you do or no.


No? then I will not tell you.


Yet I care not
Much if I hear it.

And I care not much
Whether I tell't or no.

What is it?


Nothing.


Sweet Dorylas let me know.


What pretty weather-cocks
These women are? I serve a Mistress here
Fit to have made a Planet: she will wax and wane
Twice in a minute.

But good Dorylas
Your news.

Why excellent News!


But what?


Rare news!
News fit,

For what?


To be concealed: why Mistress
The Rivalls, those on whom this Powerful face
Does play the tyra^t. --

Dorylas what of them?


Now, now she wanes: O for a dainty Husband
To make her a full Moon. The amorous couple!
Your brace of sweet hearts Damon and Alexis
Desire your audience.

Is this all your news?
You may conceal it.

Now you have heard it told
I may conceal it! well I thank thee Nature
Thou did create me Man, for I want wit
Enough to make up woman: but good Mistress
What do you think of Damon?

As a man
Worthy the best of Nymphs:

What of Alexis?


As one that may deserve the fairest Virgin
In Sicilie.

What Virgin?


Proserpine,
Were she yet Ceres daughter.

And what Damon?


He? Ceres self, were she not yet a Mother:


Creet, Creet! There is no Labyrinth but a woman^
Laurinda, gentle Mistress tell me which
Of these you love?

Why Damon best of any.


Why so, that is well and plain.


Except Alexis.


Why then you love Alexis best?


Of any.


I am glad ont.


But my Damon.


Be this true
And I Will be sworn Cupid is turned a jugler?
Praesto! you love Alexis best but Damon,
And Damon but Alexis! Love you Damon?

I do.


And not Alexis?


And Alexis.


She would ha'both I think.


Not I by Ceres.


Then you love neither?


Yes, I do love either.


Either, and yet not both, both best, yet neither;
Why do you torture those with equal Racks,
That both vow service to you? If your love
Have pre fer'd Damon, tell Alexis of it;
Or if Alexis, let poor Damon know it,
That he which is refused, smothering his flame,
May make another choice, now doubtful hope
Kindles desires in both.

Ah Dorylas,
Thy years are yet incapable of love!
Thou have not learned the mysteries of Cupid!
Do thou not see through all Sicilia,
From gentlest sheapheards to the meanest swains,
What inauspitious torches Hymen lights
At every wedding? what unfortunate hands
Link in the wedding ring? Nothing but fears
Iarres, discontents, suspicions, jealousies,
These many years meet in the Bridal sheets.
Or if all these be missing, yet a Barrenness,
A curse as cruel, or Abortive births
Are all the blessings crown the Geniall bed*
Till the success prove happier, and I find
A blessed change, i will temper my affection
Conceal my flames, dissemble all my fires
And spend those years I owe to Love and Beauty
Only in choosing on whose love to fix
My Love and beauty.

Rare Feminine wisdom:
Will you admit 'em.

Yes, go call them hither.
Yet do not, now I think on it: yet you may too;
And yet come back again.

Nay I will go.


Why Dorylas.


What news?


Come back I say.


Yes to be sent again.


You Will stay I hope.


Not I by Ceres.


Dorylas.


No good Mistress
Farewell for I at length have learned to know
You call me back only to bid me go.

It Is no great matter sirrah: -- when they come
I Will bear my self so equal unto both,
As both shall think I love him best, this way
I keep both fires alive, that when I please
I may take which I please. -- But who comes here?

O Thestylis you are welcome!

If Laurinda,
My too abrupt intrusion come so rudely
As to disturb your private Meditations,
I beg your pardon!

How now Thestylis?
Grown Orator of late? has learned Mopsus
Read Rhetorique unto you, that you come
To see me with Exordiums?

No Laurinda;
But if there be a charm called Rhetorique;
An art, that woods and forests cannot skill;
That with persuasive magique could command
A pity in your soul, I would my tongue
Had learned that powerful art!

Why Thestylis,
Thou know the breasts I sucked were neither wolves
Nor Tigers, and I have a heart of wax,
Soft and soon melting; try this amorous heart; it is not
Of flint or marble.

If it were, Laurinda,
The tears of her, whose orator I come
Have power to soften it. Beuteous Amaryllis,
She that in this unfortunate age of love,
This hapless time of Cupids tyranny
Placed her affection on a skornfull sheapheard,
One that disdaines her love.

Disdaines her love!
I tell thee Thestylis in my poor judgment,
(And women if no envy blind their eyes,
Best judge of women's beauties) Amaryllis
May make a Bride worthy the proudest sheapheard
In all Sicilia: but wherein can I
Pity this injured Nymph?

Thus she desires you,
As you desire to thrive in him you love;
As you do love him whom you most desire,
Not to love Damon! Damon alas repaies
Her love with skorne! It Is a request she says
She knows you cannot grant, but if you do not
She will not live to ask again.

Poor Nymph.
My Amaryllis knows my fidelity;
How often have we sported on the Lawnes,
And danced a roundelay to Iocastus pipe?
If I can do her service Thestylis,
Be sure I will: Good wench, I dare not stay
Least I displease my Father; who in this age
Of hapless lovers watches me as close
As did the Dragon the Hesperian fruit.
Farewell.

Farewell Laurinda! Thus poor ^oole
I toil for others; like the painful Be
From every flower cull honey drops of love
To bring to others hives: Cupid does this
Cause I am Claius sister. Other Nymphs
Have their variety of loves, for every gown,
Nay every petticote; I have only one,
The poor fool Mopsus! yet no matter wench,
Fools never were in more request then now.
I Will make much of him, for that woman lies
In weary sheets, whose Husband is too wise.

Iocastus, I love Thestylis abominably,
The mouth of my affection waters at her.

Be wary Mopsus, learn of me to skorne
The mortals; choose a better match: go love
Some Fairy Lady! Princely Oberon
Shall stand thy friend: and beauteous Mab his Queen
Give thee a Maid of Honor.

How Iocastus?
Marry a puppet? Wed a mote in the Sun?
Go look a wife in nutshells? woo a gnat
That Is nothing but a voice? No no, Iocastus,
I must have flesh and blood, and will have Thestylis.
A fig for Fairies!

-- It Is my sweetheart Mopsus,
And his wise brother: O the twins of folly!
These do I entertain only to season
The poor Amyntas madness.

Sacred red and white,
How fares thy reverend beauty?

Very ill
Since you were absent, Mopsus! where have you
Been all this live-long hour?

I have been
Discoursing with the birds.

Why, can birds speak?


In Fairy land they can: I have heard 'em chirpe
Very good Greek and Latin.

And our Birds
Talk better far then they: a new-laid egg
Of Sicilie shall out talk the bravest Parrat
In Oberons, Vtopia.

But what languages
Do they speak, servant?

Several languages,
As Cawation, Chirpation, Hootation.
Whistleation, Crowation, Cackleation,
Shreekation, Hissation.

And Fooleation.


No, that is our language, we our selves speak that,
That are the learned Augurs.

What success
Does your Art promise?

Very good.


What Birds
Met you then first?

A Wood-cock and a Goose.


Well met.


I told 'em so.


And what might this portend?


Why thus -- and first the Wood-cock -- Wood and Cock,
Both very good signs. For first the wood does signify
The fire of our love shall never goeout,
Because it has more fuel: wood does signify
Morefuell.

What the Cock?


Better then the other:
That I shall crow ore those that are my rivalls,
And roost my self with thee.

But now the Goose?


I, I the Goose, that likes me best of all,
Thou Have heard our gray-b^ard sheapherds talk of Rome,
And what the Geese did there: The Goose does signify
That I shall keep thy Capit^ll.

Good gander!


-- It cannot choose but strangely please his highness!


What are you studying of Iocastus, ha?


A rare devise, a Masque to entertain
His Grace of Fairy with.

A Masque? what is it?


An Anti-masque of fleaes, which I have taught
To dance Currantoes on a spiders thread.

An Anti-masque of fleaes? brother me thinks
A masque of Birds were better, that could dance
The morris in the air, Wrens and Robin-redbrests,
Linnets, and Titmise.

So! and why not rather
Your Geese and Wood-cocks? Mortal hold thy tongue,
Thou do not know the mystery.

It Is true
He tells you Mopsus, leave your Augurie,
Follow his counsel, and be wise.

Be wise?
I skorne the motion! follow his counsel and be wise?
That Is a fine trick in faith! is this an age
For to be wise in?

Then you mean I see,
T'expound the Oracle.

I do mean to be
Th'interpreter.

-- And then a jig of Pismires
Is excellent.

What to interpret Oracles?
A fool must be th'interpreter.

Then no doubt
But you will have the honor.

Nay I hope
I am as fair for it as another man.
If I should now grow wise against my will,
And catch this wisdom!

Never fear it Mopsus.


Twere dangerous ventring. Now I think on it too
Pray Heaven this air be wholesome! is there not
An antidote against it? what do you think
Of garlic every morning?

Fie upon it,
'Twill spoil our kissing! and besides I tell you
Garlick's a dangerous dish, eating of garlic
May breed the sickness, for as I remember
It Is the Philosophers diet.

Certainly
I am infected, now the fit's upon me!
It Is some thing like an ague, sure I caught it
With talking with a Scholar next my heart.

How sad a life live I,

Betwixt their folly and Amyntas madness!
For Mopsus I Will prescribe you such a diet
As shall secure you.

Excellent she Doctor!
Your women are the best Physicians,
And have the better practice.

First my Mopsus,
Take heed of fasting, for your hungry meals
Nurse wisdom.

True! O what a stomach have I
To be her patient!

Besides, take special care
You wear not threadbare clothes: 'twill breed at least
Suspicion you are wise.

I marry will it.


And walk not much alone; or if you walk
With company, be sure you walk with fools,
None of the wise.

No, no I warrant you,
I Will walk with no body but my brother here,
Or you, or mad Amyntas.

By all means
Take heed of Travel, your beyond sea wit
Is to be feared.

If ere I travel hang me.


Not to the Fairy land?


Thither he may.
But above all things we are no beards, long beards
Are signs the brains are full, because the excrements
Come out so plentifully.

Rather empty,
Because they have sent so much out, as if
Their brains were sunk into their beards: King Oberon
Has never a beard, yet for his wit I am sure
He might have been a Giant. Who comes here?

All hail unto the famed interpreter
Of fowls and Oracles!

Thanks good Dorylas.


How fares the winged cattle? are the woodcocks,
The jayes, the dawes, the cuckoes, and the owls
In health?

I thank the gracious stars they are!


Like health unto the president of the jigs;
I hope King Oberon and his joyall Mab
Are. well.

They are, I never saw their Graces
Eat such a meal before.

E'ne much good do it em!


They Are rid a hunting.


Hare or Dear my Lord?


Neither, a brace of snailes of the first head.


But Dorylas, there is a mighty quarrel here,
And you are chosen umpire.

About what?


The exposition of the Oracle:
Which of these two you think the verier fool.

It is a difficult cause, first let me pose'em!
You Mopsus, cause you are a learned Augur,
How many are the seven Liberal Sciences?

Why much about a dozen.


You Iocastus,
When Oberon shaved himself, who was his Barber?

I knew him well, a little dapper youth,
They call him Periwinckle.

Thestylis,
A weighty cause and asks a longer time.

We Will in the while to comfort sad Amyntas.


I wonder much that Dorylas stays so long,
Feign would I hear whether they will come or no.

Ha? would you so?


I see in your own messages
You can go fast enough.

Indeed forsooth,
I loiter'd by the way.

What, will they come?


Which of them?


Damon?


No.


Alexis will?


Nor he.


How, neither? am I then neglected?


Damon will come.


And not Alexis too?


Only Alexis comes.


Let him not come.
I wonder who sent for him, unless both
I Will speak with none.

Why both will visit you.


Both? one had been too many. Was e're Nymp^
So vexed as I? you saucy rascal you,
How do you strive to cross me?

And sweet Mistress,
Still I will cross you, it is the only way
Truly to please you.

So, you will all please her,
I wonder who will please me? you all for her
Can run on errants, carry lovesick letters,
And amorous eglogues from her howling suitors,
To her, and back again, be Cupids Heralds,
And point out meetings for her.

Truly Sir,
Not I, pray ask my Mistress: Do I call
Your sweet-hearts -- speak, nay speak it if you can,
Do I?

Why no.


Nay say your worst I care not,
Did I go ever?

Never.


La-you now!
We were devising nothing but a snare
To catch the Pole-cat,
Sirrah get you in;
Take heed I do not find your haunts.

What haunts?


You Will in!


I know no haunts I have but to the Dairy,
To skimme the milke-bowles like a lickorish Fairy.

He that is a woman's keeper, should have eyes
A hundred more then Argus, and his ears
Double the number: Now the news, what letters?
What posy, ring or bracelet wooes to day?
What Grove to night is conscious of your whispers?
Come tell me, for I know your trusty squire,
Your little closet blabbes into your ear
Some secret, let me know it.

Then you fear,
Least I should be in love.

Indeed I do,
Cupids a dangerous boy, and often wounds
The wanton roving eye.

Were I in love,
Not that I am (for yet by Dian's bow
I have not made my choice,) and yet suppose it,
Suppose I say I were in love, What then?

So I would have thee, but not yet my Girl,
Till loves prove happier, till the wretched Claius
Has satisfied the Gods.

Why Claius, Father?


Have thou not heard it?


Never.


It Is impossible.


How should I sir? you know that my discourse
Is all with walls and pictures, I nere meet
The Virgins on the downs.

Why I will tell thee,
Thou know Pilumnus?

The high Priest of Ceres?


Yes: This Pilumnus had a son Philaebus,
Who was, while yet he was, the only joy
The staff and comfort of his fathers age,
And might have still been so, had not fond love
Undone him.

How did love undo Philaebus?


Why thus; one Lalage, a beauteous Nymph
As ever eye admired, Alphestus daughter,
Was by her father promised him in marriage.

Why hitherto his love had good success.


But only promised: for the sheapherd Claius,
(A name accursed in Sicilian fields!)
Being rich, obtained the beauteous Lalage
From sweet Philaebus: he sad heart being robbed,
Of all his comfort, having lost the beauty
Which gave him life and motion; seeing Claius
Enjoy those lips, whose cherries were the food
That nursed his soul, spent all his time in sorrow,
In melancholy sighs and discontents;
Looked like a witherd tree oregrowne with moss,
His eyes were ever dropping Iceacles.
Disdain and sorrow made Pilumnus rage,
And in this rage, he makes his moan to Ceres,
( Ceres most sacred of Sicilian powers;)
And in those moanes he prosecutes revenge,
And that revenge to fall on Lalage.

Would Ceres hear his prayers?


Silly maid,
His passions were not causeless; and with what justice
Could she deny Pilumnus? how often has he sprinkled,
The finest flower of wheat, and sweetest myrrh
Upon her Altars! Lalage ru'd the time
She flowted brave Philaebus. Now she was great
With two sweet twins, the fair chaste Amaryllis,
And mad Amyntas; (an unlucky pair!)
These she brought forth, but never lived to see them:
Lucina caused her sorrows stop her breath.
Leaving this matchless pair of beauteous infants,
In whom till now she lives.

After her death,
How fared the sorrowful Philaebus?

Worse
Then ever: She being dead whose life was his,
Whose looks did hold his eyes from shutting up,
He pined away in sorrows, grief it was
To see she was not his, but greater far
That she was not at all. Her Exequies being past,
He casts him down upon that turfe of earth,
Under whose roof his Lalage was housed,
And parlied with her ashes, 'till his own lamp
Was quite extinguished with a fatal dampe.
Here ended th'noble sheapheard.

Unhappy lover!
It Is pity but the Virgins once a year,
Should wash his tomb with maiden tears! but now
Both Lalage being dead and her Philebus,
How comes it other loves should prove unfortunate?

Pilumnus having lost this hopeful Son,
Though he had two more children, fair Urania
And noble Damon; yet the death of Lalage
Sufficed not his revenge, but he a new implores
His goddess wrath against Claius: -- Does Ceres prize me thus?
Shall Claius tread upon the flowery Plain,
And walk upon the Ashes of my boy?
Will I be Archyflamen where the Gods
Are so remiss? let wolves approach their shrines;
Their howlings are as powerful as the Prayers
Of sad Pilumnus! -- Such disgusts at last
Awakened Ceres: with hollow murmuring noise
Her Ompha like a thunder'gins to roar.
(The Ompha if it menace speaks at large
In copious language, but perplexed terms.)
And laid this curse on all Trinacria.
Sicilian swains, ill luck shall long betide
To every bridegroom, and to every bride:
No sacrifice, no vow shall still mine Ire,
Till Claius blood both quench and kindle fire.
The wise shall misconceive me, and the wit
Scornd, and neglected shall my meaning hit.

Angry and Intricate! Alas for love!
What then became of Claius?

Why the Ompha,
Having denounced against him, and he knowing
The hate of old Pilumnus fled away,
I think he is sailed to the Antipodes.
No tidings can be brought what ground receives him,
Unless Corymbus make a happy voyage;
Corymbus that will search both East and Occident
And when he finds him spill his captive blood.
Which Ceres grant he may! Tender Laurinda
Now do thou see the reason of my care,
And why my watchful eyes so close observe
Thy steps and actions.

And I promise, father,
To temper my affections, 'till the Goddess
Do mitigate her anger.

Do so then:
For now you see with what unfortunate choice
Pilumnus daughter, delicate Urania loves
The mad Amyntas: for the angry Goddess,
Though she repaid the wrong done to Philaebus,
Yet not approving the reuengefull mind
Of great Pilumnus, scourged him with his own asking,
By threatening an unhappy marriage
To his Urania, unless he that wooes her
Pay an impossible Dowry; for as others
Give Portions with their daughters, Ceres Priests
Use to receive for theirs. The words are these,
That which thou have not, may not, can not have
Amyntas, is the Dowry that I crave*
Rest hopeless in thy love, or else divine
To give Urania this, and she is thine:
Which while the poor Amyntas would Interpret,
He lost his wits. Take heed of love, Laurinda,
You see th'unhappinesse of it in others;
Let not experience in thy self instruct thee.
Be wise my Girl: so come and follow me.

I Will make a Garland for my kid and follow you.
What a sad tale was here? how full of sorrow?
Happy that heart that never felt the shaft
Of angry Cupid!

-- Damon and Alexis?
Their presence quickly puts these cogitations
Out of my mind: Poor souls, I fain would pity them,
And yet I cannot, for to pity one
Were not to pity the other, and to pity
Both were to pity neither. Mine old Temper
Is all the shift I have; some dew of comfort
To either of them. How now bold intruders,
How dare you venture on my privacy?
If you must needs have this walk, be it so!
I Will seek another: What? you will let me go?
Cruel Laurinda (if a word so foul
Can have so fair a dwelling.) seal not up
Thy eats, but let a pity enter there
And find a passage to thy heart.

Laurinda,
(The name which but to speak I would not wish
For life or breath.) Let not thy powerful beauty
Torment us longer: Tell us which of us
You value most.

And the other, for old freindship
Strangling his bitter Corrasive in his heart,
Has promised to desist from further suit.

Or if he cannot so, as sure he cannot,
Yet he will rather choose to dye then live
Once to oppose your liking.

Since you are
Grown so importunate, and will not be answered
With modest silence; Know I wish you well.

How, me Laurinda?


Why I wish, Alexis,
I were thy wife.

Then most unhappy me!


That word does relish immortality.


And I do wish thou were my husband, Damon


Still more perplexed: what do you think I am?


My head, Alexis.


And what I?


My heart.


Which hand am I?


Damon, my right.


Which I?


My left, Alexis.


Thus you scorn my love.


Not I, Alexis: thou art my only hope.


Then I am all despair, no hope for me.


Why so my Damon? thou art my desire.
Alexis is my flame; Damon my fire.
Alexis does deserve my nuptial Bed,
And Damon's worthy of my Maidenhead!

Damon, desist thy suit or loose thy life;
Thou heard'st Laurinda wish she were my wife.

Thy wife, Alexis? But how can it be
Without a Husband? and I must be he.

I am her head: That word does seem t'impart
She means my marriage.

How without her heart?
For that am I: besides you heard her say
I was the right hand you the left, away,
Desist Alexis, mine is the upper hand.

But, Damon, I next to her heart do stand:
I am her hope, in that you plainly see
The end of her intents does aim at me.

But I am her desire, in that it is shown
Her only wish is to make me her own.

I am her flame.


It Is true, but I her fire.


The flames the hotter, therefore her desire
Most aims at me.

Yet when the flame is spent,
The fire continues; Therefore me she meant.

She promised now I should enjoy her Bed.


Alexis do, so I her Maidenhead.


I see she still conceales it, and with speeches
Perplexed and doubfull masks her secret thoughts.

Let Us have another meeting, since her words
Delude us thus, we will have a pregnant sign
To show her mind.

I go that way a hunting,
And will call for her.

I Will the while retire
Into the Temple, if I linger here
I am afraid of meeting Amaryllis,
Who with unwelcome love solicites me.

And would she might prevail!


Till then farewell.


All happiness to Damon be
Except Laurinda.

All but her to thee.


Thus we in love and courtesy contend.


The name of Rival should not loose the Friend.


FAther persuade me not! The power of heaven
Can never force me from Amyntas love;
It Is rooted here so deep within my heart
That he which pulls it out, pulls out at once,
That and my soul together.

Fond Urania,
Can ignorant love make thee affect the seed,
The hateful seed of cursed Lalage?
Did I for this beget thee?

Father, you know
Divinity is powerful, Cupids will
Must not be questioned: When love means to sport
(I'have heard your self relate it) he can make
The Wolf and Lamb kiss friendly; force the Lion
T'forget his Majesty, and in amorous dalliance
Sport with the frisking Kid. When Venus rides,
She Will link the ravenous Kite, and milder Swan
To the same chariot, and will yoke together
The necks of Doves and Eagles; when as she
Commands, all things loose their Antipathie,
Even contrarieties: can I alone
Resist her will? I cannot, my Amynt as
Shall witness that!

I blame thee not so much
For loving him, while yet he was Amynt as.
But being mad and having lost himself,
Why should not thou loose thy affection too*

I love him now the rather; he has lost
Himself for me, and should he loose me too?
It were a sin he should!

What can thou love
In his distempered wildness?

Only that,
His wildness; it is the comfort I have left
To make my tears keep time to his distractions;
To think as wildl^ as he talks; to marry
Our griefs together, since our selves we cannot.
The Oracle does ask so strange a Dowry,
That now his company is the only bliss
My love can aim at: but I stay too long
I Will in to comfort him.

Do not Urania.


Do not?
I must and will; Nature commands me no,
But Love more powerful says it shall be so.

The Gods did well to make their Destinies
Of women, that their wills might stand for law
Fixed and unchanged; who is this? Corymbus? he.

Corymbus -- welcome!


Sacred Pilumnus -- hayle!
And fruitful Sicilie I kiss thy dust --

What news Corymbus? Is our Countrie's Mischief
Fettered in chains?

Thrice the sun has past
Through the twelve Inns of heaven, since my diligence
Has been employed in quest of him, whose death
Must give poor lovers life, the hateful Claius;
Yet could I never hear of him: -- The mean while
How fare the poor Sicilians? Does awful Ceres
Still bend her angry brow? Find the sad Lovers
No rest, no quiet yet?

Corymbus none!
The Goddess has not yet deigned to accept
One sacrifice, no favorable Echo
Resounded from her Omp^a; All her answers
Are full, and doubtful.

The true sign, Pilumnus,
Her wrath is not appeased.

Appeased say you?
Rather again incensed so far, Corymbus,
As that my self am plagued; My poor Urania
Dotes on Amyntas.

First shall our hives swarm in the venomous yew,
And Goats shall browze upon our myrtle wands!
-- One of your blood, Pilumnus, (is it possible)
Love Lalage and Claius brood?

The chain of fate
Will have it so! And he loved her as much.

That makes it something better.


Ah, thou know not
What sting this waspish fortune pricks me with!
I seeing their loves so constant, so inflexible,
Chid with dame Ceres if sheus'd me thus.
My words were inconsiderate, and the heavens
Punished my rough expostulations:
Being Archiflamen of Trinacria
I did demand a Dowry of that sheapheard
That asks my daughter: -- Set the price said I,
Thou Goddess, that do cause such hateful loves;
If that Amyntas be thy darling swain,
Ask thou, and set a Dowry for Urania:
With that the Altar groaned, my hair grew stiff,
Amyntas looked aghast; Urania quiver'd,
And the Ompha answered

With an Echo;


No.


Then I presage some ill!


This dark demand,
That which thou have not, may not, can not have,
Amyntas, is the dowry that I crave:
Rest hopeless in thy love, or else divine
To give Urania this and she is thine.
And so he did, but the perplexed sense
Troubled his brains so far, he lost his wits;
Yet still he loves, and she, -- my grief Corymbus
Will not permit me to relate rest!
I Will in into the Temple, and express
What Is yet behind in tears.

Sad sad Pilumnus!
And most distressed Sicilians! Other nations
Are happy in their loves, you only are unfortunate!
In all my travelles never a spring but had
Her pair of lovers, singing to that music
The gentle bubling of her waters made.
Never a walk unstor'd with amorous couples,
Twind with so close embraces, as if both
Me ant to grow one together! every shade
Sheltred some happy loves, that counting dazies
Scor'd up the sums on one another lips,
That met so often and close, as if they had
Changed souls at every kiss. The married sort
As sweet and kind as they: at every evening
The loving husband and full* brested wife
Walked on the Downs so friendly, as if that
Had been their wedding day. The boys of five,
And girls of four, e're that their lisping tongues
Had learned to prattle plain, would prate of love,
Court one another, and in wanton dalliance
Return such innocent kisses, you would have thought
You had seen Tur les billing.

What air is that? The voice of -- Turtles billing!
Of Turtles! a good Omen! she is chaste --
And billing, billing, o delicious billing!
That word presages kissing. --

Who is this?
Mopsus, my learned Augur?

Stand aside,
-- The other side; I will not talk to thee
Unless I have the wind.

Why, what is the matter Mopsus?


Thou Art infected;


What with the Plague?


Worse then the Plague, the Wisdom!
You have been in travel, and that is dangerous
For getting Wisdom.

Then nere fear it, Mopsus,
For I come home a fool just as I went.

By Ceres?


Yes.


By Ceres welcome then!


But Mopsus, why do you walk here alone!
That Is -- dangerous too!

I: but I come to meet
The Citizens of the air; you have heard my skill
In augury?

Why I have heard your name
Not mentioned any where in all my Travailes.

How? not mentioned?


-- Yo'are to hasty Mopsus,
Not -- without admiration.

I know that.


How should you know it?


Why some birds or other,
Fly from all countries hither, and they tell me.

But how dare you converse with birds that travel?


With an antidote I may: but my Corymbus
What strange birds have you seen beyond seas?

Brave ones:
Ladies with fans and feathers! dainty Fowls!
There were brave taking Augury.

But, Corymbus,
Are those fine Lady-birds such pretty things?

As tame as sparrowes, and as sweet as Nightingals.


Is the Cocklady-bird, or the Henlady-bird
The better?

All are hens.


O admirable!
Would you had brought me one! but what is the Fan?

A fan's a -- wing of one side.


Delicate!
And what is their Feather?

Like the copple-crowne
The Lap-wing has:

The Lap-wing? then they 'l -- ly.


With men they will;


Delicious Lady-birds!
But have they such brave trains, such curious tails
As our birds have?

Like Peacocks, there is the head
Of all their pride.

Nay it is the tail, Corymbus,
Surely these things you call the Lady-birds
Are the true birds of Paradise!

Very right --
Mopsus, I cannot stay, I must attend
My carriage to the Temple: gentle Mopsus
Farewell!

Farewell Corymbus! By my troth
I never longed for any thing in my life
So much as Lady-birds; dainty Lady-birds!
I would fetch one of them; but I dare not travel
For fear I catch the wisdom. O sweet Lady-birds!
With copple crowns, and wings but on one side!
And tails like Peacocks! curious Lady-birds!

That which I have not, may not, cannot have! --
It is the moon! Urania, thou shall wear
The horned Goddess at thy beauteous ear.
-- Come hither Pegasus, I will mount thy back,
And spur thee to her orb.

Oh good Amyntas!


-- Why, art thou foundred Pegasus? Amaryllis,
Fetch him a peck of provender.

Sweet Amyntas!


What says my Cytherea? would thou eat
A golden Apple? if thou will, by Venus
I Will rob the Hesperian Orchard.

Ha ha he!


Ha? do thou laugh old Charon? firrah sculler,
Prepare thy boat!

For what? dear brother speak!


Art thou my sister Helen? were we hatchd
In the same egshell? -- Is your cock-boat ready?

It is, an't please your Worship.


Very well!
Row me to hell! -- no faster? I will have thee
Chained unto Pluto's galleys!

Why to hell,
My dear Amyntas?

Why? to borrow money!


Borrow there?


I there! they say there be more Usurers there
Then all the world besides: -- see how the winds
Rise! Puff -- puff Boreas. -- what a cloud comes yonder?
Take heed of that wave Charon! ha? give me
The oars! -- so so: the boat is overthrown,
Now Charons drowned: but I will swim to shore --

O Ceres, now behold him! canthy eyes
Look on so sad an object, and not melt
Them and thy heart to pity?

How this grief
Racks my tormented soul? but the neglect
Of Damon more afflicts me: the whole Senate
Of heaven decrees my ruin.

And mine too.
Come Amaryllis let us weep both together,
Contending in our sorrows!

Would to Ceres
That I were dead!

And I had nere been borne!


Then had not I been wretched!


Then Amyntas
Might have been happy.

Nay if you begin
Once to talk wisely, It Is above high time,
That I were gone: farewell Bellerophon!
I must go seek my Thestylis; she is not here.

My arms are weary; -- now I sink I sink!
Farewell Urania. --

Alas what strange distraction,
Toss his distemperd brain!

Yet still his love to me
Lives constant.

Styx I thank thee! That curld wave
Has tos'd me on the shore. -- come Sysiphus.
I Will roll thy stone a while: me thinks this labor
Does look like Love! does it not so, Tysiphone?

Mine is that restless toil.


Is It so, Erynnis?
You are an idle huswife, go and spin
At poor Ixions wheel!

Amyntas.


Ha?
Am I known here?

Amyntas, dear Amyntas --


Who calls Amyntas? beauteous Proserpine?
It Is she. -- Fair Empress of the Elysian shades,
Ceres bright daughter intercede for me,
To thy incensed mother: prithee bid her
Leave talking riddles, will thou?

How shall I
Apply my self to his wild passions!

Seem to be
What he conceives you.

Queen of darkness,
Thousupreme Lady of eternal night,
Grant my petitions! will thou beg of Ceres
That I may have Urania?

It Is my prayer,
And shall be ever, I will promise thee
She shall have none but him.

Thanks Proserpine!


Come sweet Amyntas, rest thy troubled head
Here in my lap: -- Now here I hold at once
My sorrow and my comfort: Nay ly still.

I will: but Proserpine --


Nay, good Amyntas. --


Should Pluto chance to spy me, would not he
Be jealous of me?

No.


Tysiphone,
Tell not Urania of it, least she fear
I am in love with Proserpine: do not Fury!

I will not.


Pray ly still!


You Proserpine,
There is in Sicilie the fairest Virgin
That everblest the land, that ever breathed,
Sweeter then Zephyrus! did thou never hear
Of one Urania?

Yes.


This poor Urania
Loves an unfortunate sheapheard, one that is mad, Tysiphone,
Can thou believe it? Elegant Urania
(I cannot speak it without tears) still loves
Amyntas, the distracted mad Amyntas.
Is It not a constant Nymph? -- But I will go
And carry all Elysium on my back,
And that shall be her jointure.

Good Amyntas,
Rest here a while! --

Why weep you Proserpine?


Because Urania weeps to see Amyntas
So restless and unquiet.

Does she so?
Then will I ly as calm as does the sea,
When all the winds are locked in Aeolus jayle:
I will not move a hair, not let a nerve
Or Pulse to beat, least I disturb her! Hush, --
She sleeps!

And so do you.


You talk too loud,
You Will waken my Urania:

If Amyntas,
Her dear Amyntas would but take his rest,
Urania could not want it.

Not so loud!


What a sad pair are we?


How miserable?
He that I love is not! --

And he that I
Do love, loves not; or, if he love, not me.

I have undone Amyntas!


And my Damon
Has undone me.

My kindness ruined him.


But his unkindnesse, me; unhappy me!


More wretched I, for Damon has his reason,
And he may love.

But does not: thy Amyntas
Returns thee mutual love.

True, Amaryllis,
But he has lost his reason; mine has love,
No reason.

Mine has reason, but no love.
O me!

My Amaryllis, how thy griefs
Meet full with mine to make the truest story
Of perfect sorrow that ere eye bedewed
With tears of Pity!

Come Urania:
Let Us sit together like two marble monuments
Of ever weeping misery --

Minds in love,
Do count their days by minutes, measure hours
By every sand that drops through the slow glass;
And for each vie a tear.

If so, my Damon,
How many times has thy unkindnesse ruined
Sad Amaryllis? every frown is mortal.

Ill luck, to seek my love and find my hate!


Be not so cruel to me! Gentle Damon,
-- Accept this witness of my love, it is
The story of poor Ech^, tha^ for love
Of her Narcissus pined into a voice.

Do thou so too!


Damon, suppose I should,
And then the Gods for thy contempt of me
Should plague thee like Narcissus.

Amaryllis,
They cannot do it: I have fixed my love
So firm on my Laurinda, that for her
I e're shall hate my self?

--. Prithee love accept it,
'Twas wrought by mine own hand

For that I hate it!


Fie Brother, can you be of the same stock,
Issue, and blood with me, and yet so cruel?

Nor can I, sister, dote like you on any
That is the cursed brat of Lalage.

Say thou so Centaure? --


Good Amyntas hold,
This is the Sacred Valley: here it is death,
For to shed human blood.

Still idly you complain
To cross me, Amaryllis, but in vain!

O, I am sick to death!


What a brave show
The monsters brains would make?

My grief over weighs me!


How fares my Amaryllis?


Like a Taper
Almost burnt out: sometimes all a darkness,
And now and then a flash or two of comfort,
But soon blown out again. Ah Thestylis,
I cannot long subsist. For thee vain's labor;
Away! I hate thee cause my Damon does,
And for that reason too I hate my self,
And every thing but him!

Come my sad partner,
Poor rival of my sorrows: Go with me
Into the Temple; I Will entreat my Brother
To use thee kindly: if in me it lie,
I Will help thee.

Do Urania, or I dye.


What a strange thing is Love!


It is a madness:
See how it stares? -- Have at thee thou blind Archer!
-- O I have mist him! -- now I Will stand thee Cupid!
Look how the rascal winkes a one eye, Thestylis!
Nay draw your arrow home boy! just in the heart!
-- O I am slain!

Amyntas.


Do not see?
My blood runs round about me, I lie soaking
In a red Sea, take heed! see Thestylis,
Whata fine Crimson it is?

Where?


Here you puppet!
Do thou not see it?

Yes I see it plain,
But I spy nothing.

Then thou art a mole.


Now I look better on it, I see it plain;
Does it not not hurt you?

Strangely! Have at thee --
How think you now?

Be quiet good Amyntas.


You Will fright away the birds else, and clean spoil
My augury.

Go about it, I am quiet!


Now for some happy Omen!


Ha, ha, he!


Why laughs the madman?


Who can choose but laugh?
The bird cried Horns!

What happiness portends it,
Sweet Mopsus?

Constancy in Love, my Thestylis,
This bird is always in a note.

Most excellent.


Bird of the spring I thank thee! Mopsus thanks thee.


This is a man of skill, an Oedipus,
Apollo, Reverent Phoebus, Don of Delphos.

What a brave man am I?


Thou can resolve
By thy great Art all questions: What is that,
That which I have not, may not, cannot have?

That which you have not, may not, cannot have?
It is my skill, you cannot have my skill.

Where lies that skill?


Lies? here within this noddle.


Fetch me my wood-knife I will cut it off,
And send it to Urania for a dowry.

No, no I am deceived, it is not that.


You dolt, you ass, you cuckoe:


Good Amyntas.


Mopsus. Iocastus. Thestylis. Amyntas.


Is It not a brave sight Dorylas? can the mortals
Caper so nimbly!

Verily they cannot!


Does not King Oberon bear a stately presence?
Mab is a beauteous Empress.

Yet you kissed her
With admirable courtship.

I do think
There will be of Iocastus brood in Fairy.

You Cuckold-maker, I will tell King Oberon
You lie with Mab his wife!

Do not good brother,
And I Will woo Thestylis for thee.

Do so then.


Can thou love Mopsus, mortal?


Why suppose
I can sir, what of that?

Why then be wise,
And love him quickly!

Wise? then I Will have none of her, that is the way
To get wise children, 'troth and I had rather
They should be bastards.

No, the children may
Be like the Father.

True distracted Mortal:
Thestylis, I say love him he is a fool.

But we will make him rich, then it is no matter.


But what estate shall he assure upon me?


A Royal jointure all in Fairy land.


Such will I make Urania!


Dorylas knows it,
A curious Park.

Pal'd round about with Pick-teeth.


Besides a house made all of mother of Pearl;
An Ivory Teniscourt.

A nutmeg Parlour.


A Saphyre dary-roome.


A Ginger hall.


Chambers of Agate.


Kitchins all of Crystal.


O admirable! This is it for certain!


The jacks are gold.


The spits are Spanish needles.


Then there be walks


Of Amber.


Curious orchards.


That bear as well in winter as in summer.


Bove all the fishponds! every pond is full,


Of Nectar: will this please you? every grove
Stored with delighfull birds.

But be there any
Lady-birds there.

Abundance.


And Cuckoes too
To presage constancy?

Yes.


Nay then lets in
To seal the writings.

There boy, so, ho, ho.


What pretty things are these both to be borne
To Lands and Livings, we poor witty knaves,
Have no inheritance but Brains: -- who is this?
-- One of my Mistress beagles.


Dorylas,
I have had the bravest sport.

In what, Alexis?


In hunting, Dorylas: a brace of Grayhounds cours'd a stag
With equal swiftness till the wearied dear,
Stood bay at both alike: the fearful dogs
Durst neither fasten.

So, and did not you
Compare the stag to my fair mistress? ha!
Pursued by you and Damon, caught by neither?

By Cupid thou art in the right.


Alas poor whelps,
In troth I pity you! Why such a hunting
Have we had here: Two puppies of a litter,
Mopsus and wise Iocastus hunting folly
With a full mouth.

I much wonder, Dorylas,
Amyntas can be sad, having such follies
To provoke mirth.

And to that end his sister
Keeps them about him; but in vain, his Melancholy
Has took so deep impression.

My Alexis
Well met, I'ave been at your cottage to seek you.

But I am never at home; Thou and I, Damon,
Are absent from our selves.

Excellent application!
To see the wit of love!

Let us go seek her,
To have a final judgment.

That may end
One of our miseries, and the others life!

O lamentable! who would be in love?


Content.


Here comes my joy or death.


O pitiful!


My sweet affliction.


Pitifully sweet!
Nere fear your father, Mistress, kiss securely,
I Will be your Mercury, and charm a sleep
Old Argus.

Do.


But if he chance to spy
You and your sweet-hearts here, I know not of it.

You do not!


Nay you know if I had seen them,
I should have told him.

You Are a trusty servant.


Poor Dorylas is blind, he sees not here
Damon, no nor Alexis.

No not he!


Alack I am innocent: if the belly swell
I did not fetch the poison.

No, begone.


Laurinda now for mercy sake give period
To our long miseries.

Now you are like cruel
To both, and play the tyrant equally,
On him you hate as much as him you love.

Depriving one the comfort of his joy.


The other the sure remedy of his death!


Damon you have a Love, fair Amaryllis,
Content your self with her.

I Will rather kiss
An Ethiops crisped lip: embrace a Viper!
Deformity it self to her is fair.

Damon thou have thy answer.


And Alexis,
There be in Sicilie many Virgins more
Worthy your choice: why did you placed on me?
Go seek some other.

O those words to me
Are Poison.

But to me an Antidote.


Thus she gave life to me to take it away:


And me she slew to raise me up again:

You shall not slight us thus, what do you think
Of me?

Thou art the glory of the woods.


And what am I?


The pride of all the Plains.


These your ambiguous terms have now too often
Deluded us.

Show by some sign which of us
You have designed for happiness.

So I will.

Damon, as I affect thee, so I vow
To wear this Garland that adornes thy brow.
This wreath of flowers, Alexis, which was mine
Because thou love me truly, shall be thine.
This is plain dealing; let not Cupid's wars
Drive your affections to uncivil jarres!

Now happy Damon she thy Garland wears
That holds thy heart chained in her golden hairs!

Most blessed I! this Garland once did twine
About her head that now embraces mine.

Desist Alexis, for she deignes to have
The Garland that was mine.

But me she gave
That which was hers.

It Is more to take then give.


I think it is greater kindness to receive.


By this your share's the less, you but receive.


And by your argument, yours you did but give*
Love is the Garland.

Then she did approve
Of my affection best, she took my love.

Fond Damon, she accepted love from thee,
But what is more, she gave her love to me;
In giving that to me, she proves my right.

Why took she mine, but meaning to requite?


I will dispute no more.


Then let our spears
Plead for us,

And determine of our fears.
Come Damon, by this argument let us prove,
Which it is of us Laurinda best does love.

Yet it is, Alexis, clean against our oath.


True, Damon, and perchance may ruin both*


So neither shall enjoy her.


Cruel breath!
Besides this is the Sacred Vale, it is death
To stain the hallowed grass but with one drop
Of humane blood.

So both should loose their hope!


And which is more, it is against her commands.


Whose every breath has power to stay our hands.


We Will have her answer make a certain end.


Till then, Alexis, let me be thy friend.


Come Damon, lets together seek relief.


It Is fit, being Rivalls both in love and grief.


LAurinda, by thy self, the sweetest oath
That can be sworn,

By those fair eyes, whose light
Comfort my soul;

Whose heat inflameth mine;


Unless you deigne at length to end our strife,


We both have vowed to sacrifice our life,


On one another spear.


What shall I do?
I find an equal war within my soul,
My self divided; now I would say Damon,
Another time Alexis, then again
Damon, and then Alexis: like a sheapheard
That sees on either hand a ravenous wolf,
One snatching from his ewe a tender Lamb,
The other watching for a gentle Kid,
Knows not poor soul which hand to turn to first.
Now he would save his Lamb; but seeing his Kid
Half in the jaw of death, turns back in have
To reseue that, where viewing then his Lamb
In greater danger, runs to that again;
As doubtful which to save as which to loose:
So fares it now with me. But love instruct me!

Resolve.


Or we will resolve.


No trick left yet?


If ever one was peppered look on me!


Why what is the matter?


You talk of Love and Cupid,
I have been plagued with a whole swarm of Cupids.

what should this mean?


I know not, but I am sure
I have a thousand natural rapiers
Stick in my flesh!

The meaning of the riddle?


The moral?


In plain terms I have been driving
One of your swarms of Bees, gentle Laurinda;

The purest wax give Damon: and, good swain,
The honey to Alexis: This is plain.

Now will the honey and the wax fall together by the ears.


Alexis, this plain sign confirms her grant,
She gave me wax to seal the covenant.

Well argued for the wax, now for the honey.


To me she gave the honey, that must be
The sweetest, and the sweetest sweet is she.

The honey is the sweeter argument.


But by the wax she says that she from none
But me will take true loves impression.

The wax is very forward to the bargain;
He would be sealing of her.

But plain the honey speaks, no other guest
But I, shall taste in her a lovers feast.

Delicious reason, my mouth waters at it*


The wax must make the Taper that must light
The wedded pair to bed on Hymen's night:
Besides it is virgins wax, by that you see
To me she destinies her virginity.

Two excellent twin-arguments borne at a birth.


And honey shows a wedding; that must knead
A cake for Hymen ere we go to bed.
Take you the wax; the honey is for me,
There is no honey in the world but she.

His disputation still has some good relish in it.


I see, Alexis, all Laurinda's bees
Serve but to sting us both.

Now, what is the matter?
The moral?

See what it is to live a maid!
Now two at once do serve us and adore,
She that weds one, serves him, served her before.

Alexis come!


Come Damon!


Cure my fear.


There Is no help left but in a Pelian spear!


O stay your hands, for by my maidenhead; --


Happy the man shall quit her of that oath.


Most happy Dorylas!


I knew that before!


I have protested never to disclose
Which it is that best I love: But the first Nymph,
As soon as Titan guilds the Eastern hills,
And chirping birds, the Saints-bell of the day,
Ring in our ears a warning to devotion.
That lucky damsel what so e're she be
Shall be the Goddess to appoint my love,
To say, Laurinda this shall be your choice:
And both shall swear to stand to her award!

By fair Laurinda's hand we swear.


Till then
Be friends, and for this night it is my pleasure
You sleep like friendly Rivalls arm in arm.

Thanks to the fair Laurinda!


Come Damon, you this night with me shall rest.


Were thou but my Laurinda I were blessed.


Mistress, if they should dream now. --


And they should?


Sweet Amaryllis!


Stay me not Urania!


More Cupids, more bees, more stinging yet!


Disheveled hair, poor ornament of the head
I Will tear you from my crown! what do thou here?
Weak chains! my pride presumed you had a power
To fetter Heroes! and in amorous Gives
Lead any sheapheard captive!

Amaryllis.


But Damon breaks thee like a spiders loome!
And thou poor face that were so often beli'de
For fair and beauteous, by my flattering glass;
I Will tear those crimson roses from my cheeks,
That but my self nere yet enchanted any.
My will is fixed!

Where go you, Amaryllis?


Since Damon hates my life I Will go and see
If I can please him in my death: if he will but deigne
To kiss me, and accept my latest breath,
I shall salute the Gods a happy soul.
-- This dart I Will give him; and upon my knees*
Beg till I have obtained to dye by him:
Death from that hand is welcome.

I will show you
A way most probable to redeem his love.

I shall wrong you, Laurinda! No enjoy him,
The treasure of the Earth: my latest words
Shall be prayers for you: mild Urania,
Sister in blood to Damon, not in affection,
Nymph take this whistle, 'twas a Tritons once,
With which I call my Lamb-kins when they stray;
It Is Amaryllis last bequeathment to you.

Live happy sheapheardesse and wear it still!


Laurinda, my great legacy is yours,
Gentle-ungentle Damon.

I re*bequeath him to my Amarylis:
Come therefore amorous maid, be ruled by me;
This night we will sleep together.

And she too
Should dream of Damon. --

Dorylas, go to Thestylis
^*excuse her this nights absence, Amaryllis
Wenches are nere so witty as a bed,
And two together make a statesmans head.
-- Begone to Thestylis.

So, I am sure
Still Cupids factor: well ere long I see
There will be many an heir the more for me.

My Bellamore you are under good protection;
The Temple gates will close unless I have.

Urania, a happy night unto you!


The like to her that ipitties the distressed Amaryllis.


So so, this honey with the very thought
Has made my mouth so lickorish that I must
Have something to appease the appetite.
Have at Iocastus orchard! dainty Apples,
How lovely they look! Why these are Dorylas sweet-hearts.
Now must I be the Princely Oberon,
And in a royal humor with the rest
Of royal Fairies attendant go in state
To rob an orchard: I have hid my robes
On purpose in a hollow tree. Heaven bless me!
What Pucke, what Goblins this?

Thrice Sacred Valley,
I kiss thy hallowed Earth!

Another lover,
Enamored of the Ground!

Feign would I speak
And ask for Amaryllis: but my fear
Will not permit me.

Slid; I think he takes me
For Oberon already.

Youth, can you tell me
How I may speak to night with Amaryllis?

Age, by no means to night: this night she lodges
With fair Laurinda, old Medorus daughter.

Can you instruct me then how I may meet Amyntas?


Who, the madman? Every evening
He walks abroad into the vallie here
With Thestylis. Farewell old walking Ivibush.

I see the smoke steame from the Cottage tops,
The fearful hus wife rakes the embers up.
All hush to bed. Sure no man will disturb me.
O blessed valley! I the wretched Claius
Salute thy happy soil, I that have lived
Pelted with angry curses in a place
As horrid as my griefs, the Lylibaean mountains,
These sixteen frozen winters, there have I
Been with rude out-lawes, living by such sins
As run of the score with justice against my prayers and wishes.
And when I would have tumbled down a rock,
Some secret power restrained me: There I lately heard
By a disconsolate Pilgrim that sought death,
That my Amyntas wits (ah me!) were marred.
It Was not a time to think to save my self
When my poor boy was lost. Lost said I? -- O Phoebus,
If there be sovereign power in juice of herbs,
And that the teeming earth yield medicinal flowers
To cure all maladies, I have sought the skill;
No leaf no root has escaped me: I may boast it,
I have been natures diligent Apothecary.
Be lucky my emplaister! I have tempered
The surest Recipe the worlds garden yields;
'Twould put Orestes in his wits again.
I know I step upon my death: the Oracle
Desires my blood for sacrifice, and Pilumnus
For his old hate still seeks it: make long stay
I dare not, only I desire t'apply
My medicine and be gone. Who Is this I spy?

-- I do remember now that countenance;
It is my sister Thestylis, I Will stand close
T'observe their actions.
Would to Ceres
She would be pleased at length to end her anger,
And pity poor Amyntas!

So pray I.


I have the bravest spaniell in the world,
Of a sharp sent and quick. so ho ho, so ho ho!
Ringwood, Iowler, Whitefoot, so ho ho! so ho ho!

I shall be a whole kennell of dogs anon.


Juno, Vulcan, Venus! so ho ho, so ho ho!


Lord what a heavenly puppy he makes me now!


There Lady there!


Ha? be their Lady-dogs as well as Lady-birds too!


Beauty, Beauty.


Slid I was never called that name before:
Thestylis, Amyntas calls me Beauty,
I prithee come kiss me.

Thus I spend my life
Laughing amidst my tears.

Now Virtue Virtue!


Is that a dogs name too? would I were hanged
If I Will have any of it for that trick.

Do thou not sent it yet? Close, close you rogue!
By Pan the curre hunts counter.

Oh good master! Bow wow, bow wow wow --


So now he has't again.
What at a fault you mungrell? will you never
Start me this Oracle?

Start an Oracle?
As if an Oracle were a hare?

So it is,
And skuds away so swift we cannot take it.
Start me this Oracle.

Start it who is will for me,
For I Will not start it.

Then unkennell it.


Vnkennell it?


I, it is a Fox a Fox,
A cunning crafty rogue: no body knows
Which way to find him. ha? what sent is this?
Do thou not smell?

What?


The meaning of the Oracle?
Vnkennell it, or I will lease thee.

Good sir,
I have no skill in starting or unkennelling,
But if you will have me spring an Oracle. --

And will thou do it? spring me then this Oracle!


I that I will, my skill lies all in birds,
Whose flight I fear I have observed so long
That I am metamorphos'd to a spaniell.

Look how my hawke of understanding soars
About the Partridge Oracle! -- ill luck!
It Is at retreat again.

O shall I never
Rid me of this misfortune! (thanks good omen)
Cras, cras she says, tomorrow 'twill be better.
Black bird I thank thee!

Little thinks the wretched Claius now
How sad a life his poor Amyntas lives!

Too well unto his grief. -- I Will go unto him
And follow him in his humor: -- You have got
A dainty spanniell, sir.

I think the world
Cannot afford his equal.

What breed is he?


True Spartan I Will assure you.


Was the sire
Of the same Country?

No, as I remember
He was an Irish Greyhound, but the damme
Came of Acteons brood.

As how I pray?


Why thus; Melampus was the sire of Laelaps,
Laelaps to Lagon, Lagon to Ichnobates,
Ichnobates to Pamphagus, and Pamphagus
To Dorceus, he to Labros, that was sire
To Oresitrophus, Oresitrophus
To fleet Theridamas, Theridamas
To swift Nebrophonos, Nebrophonos
To the quick-nos'd Aellus; he to Dromas,
Dromas to Tygris, Tygris to Orybasus,
Orybasus to Pterelas, he to Nape,
The damme of Mopsus.

So then Orybasus
Was my great grandfather. Though I be a Dog,
I come of a good house. My Ancestors
Were all of Noble names past understanding*
What a brave man's my Master! where learned he
All this? Never stir now I could find in my heart
To leave my Augury and study Heraldry;
A man I think may learned as well as the other,
Yet never fear of growing too wise upon it.
And then will I record the pedigree
Of all the dogs in the world. O that I had
The Arms of all our house byth' Mothers side!

Sir I have brave things in a Basket for you.
Give me your Dog, and you shall have 'em all.

Take him.


O heavens! and shall I change my master,
One mad man for another?

Curre be quiet,
I have said it, and my will shall be a law.

O good sir, for Melampus sake, and Dorceus
Laelaps, Ichnobates, Lagon, Melanchetes,
Labros, Nebrophonos, Oresitrophus,
Tygris, Orybatus, Therydamas,
Aellus, Dromes, Nape, and the rest
Of all my Noble ancestors deceased,
Be merciful unto me! Pity pity
The only hope of all our family.

Sir, can he fetch and carry?


You shall see him.
Fetch sirrah: -- there: -- the curre is run away,
Help me to catch my dog: you will bring you mungrell?

Yes much! the birds will not advise me to it.


Sylvan why gaze you on us? would you frolike
With poor Amynta's madness; 'twould ill beseem you
To make our grief your pastime.

Not I by heaven!
My joys are counterfeit, my sorrows real:
(I cannot hold from weeping) ah you know not
What grief lies here within, (tears you will betray me!)
Give me my eye full of this noble sheapheard!
Who has not heard how he has chased the boar!
And how his spear has torn the panch of wolves.
On the bark of every tree his name's ing^aven.
Now Planet struck, and all that virtue vanished.

Thy looks are fierce, thy words bespeak thee Gentle.


Why wep't he Thestylis!


I did not mark him.


It was a mote in's eye: I Will kiss it out;
I Will curle thy shackl'd locks, and crispe thy hair
Like the streight-growing Cypress. Come let us put
Our heads together. Thou art more then mortal,
And shal't expound to Ceres what she asks.
It is a gallant Sylvan, Thestylis.

I am not skilled in riddles, no interpreter
Of Divinations, but dare contend
With any Empyrick to do a cure,
Whether the body or the mind be sick.
That is my study, I but crave the leave
To try the power of art upon this sheapheard.
If Aesculapius be propitious to him,
After the dew of one nights softer slumbers,
I dare be bold to say he shall recover.

My dog again? do read it in the stars?
What a strange man is this?

Thy wits, Amyntas,
I mean; O cast thy arms in my embraces,
Speak careful Nymph how came he thus distracted?

I do you mean? with a very-very-very mad* trick* --
By making verses.

Rest rest deluded fancy!


There was a time (alas that ere it was.)
When my poor sheapheard fell in love.

With whom?


The star of beauty, Pilumnu's much admired Urania.


O the cross darts of fate!


She sweet Nymph inlodged
The casket of his love in her own bosom,
But Ceres set a Dowry* Out alas!
Would she had asked our flocks, our kids, our groves!
Would she had bid us quench the flames of Aetna
In Arethusa's streams, it had been easy.
We fight with words and cannot conquer them;
This her Imperious Ompha asked, and Thundered
That which thou have not, may not, can not have
Amyntas, is the Dowry that I crave.
To find out her commands, he lost himself.

Your storie's pitiful: It Is my profession
To wander through the Earth, and in my Travel,
I am inquisitive after the sick to heal 'em;
Their cure and kind acceptance is my pay.
You will not fear to lodge me for a night?

We have but homely hospitality.


I Will feast thee with some Venison, brave Montano.


Thy restitution is my feast Amyntas;
Your curdes and chestnuts and your country fare
Is bounteous for so mean a guest as I:
But send for that Urania her sweet voice
Must sing a Lullaby to drown his senses,
And charm soft sleep upon his troubled fancy.
And before the gray-eyd morn do peep, be confident
I Will put the music of his brains in tune.

You Will call Urania.


Doubt not sir, I will.
Or send my servant Mycon by the Vale.

Come Sylvan, if the dogs do bark I Will brain 'em;
We Will sleep to night together, and to morrow,

Will end I hope thy madness, not my sorrow.


We Will go a hunting, so ho ho! so ho ho!


Are the mad dogs gone yet?
A little more would have persuaded me
Into a spaniell: and I may be one
For any thing I know: yet sure I am not
Because methinkes I speak; but an this speaking
Should be but barking now: If I be a dog
Heaven send me a better Master then the former.
Ceres defend me, what strange Elves are there!

How like you now my Grace? is not my countenance
Royal and full of Majesty? Walk not I
Like the young Prince of Pigmies? Ha? my knaves,
We Will fill our pockets. Look look yonder, Elves,
Would not you apples tempt a better conscience
Then any we have to rob an Orchard? ha!
Fairies, like Nymphs with child, must have the things
They long for. You sing here a Fairy catch
In that strange tongue I taught you: while our self
Do clime the Trees. Thus Princely Oberon
Ascends his throne of State.

Nos beata Fauni Proles,
Quibus non est magnamoles,
Quamvis Lunam incolamus,
Hortos saepe frequentamus.
Furto cuncta magis bella,
Furto dulctor Puella.
Furto omnia decora.
Fur to poma dulciora.
Cum mortales lecto jacent,
Nobis poma noctu placent,
Illa tamen sunt ingrata,
Nisi furto sint parata.

What divine noise fraught with immortal harmony
Salutes mine ear?

Why this immortal Harmony
Rather salutes your Orchard: these young Rascals,
These pescod*shalers do so cheat my Master:
We cannot have an apple in the Orchard,
But straight some Fairy longs for it: well if I
Might have my will, a whip again should jerk h'em,
Into their old mortality:

Dare thou schreetch-owle
With thy rude croaking interrupt their music;
Whose melody has made the spheres to lay
Their heavenly lutes aside, only to listen
To their more charming notes?

Say what you will,
I say a cudgel now were excellent Music.

Oberon descend citus,
Ne cogaris hinc invitus.
Canes audio latrantes,
Et mortales vigilantes.

Prince Oberon? I heard his Graces name.


O ho: I spy his Grace! Most noble Prince
Come down, or I will pelt your Grace with stones,
That I believe your Grace was never so pelted
Since 'twas a Grace.

Bold mortal, hold thy hand.


Immortal Thief come down, or I will fetch you:
Methinks it should impair his Graces honor
To steal poor mortals apples: Now have at you!

Iocastus, we are Oberon, and we thought
That one so near to us as you in favor,
Would not have suffered this profane rude groom
Thus to impair our royalty.

Gracious Prince,
The fellow is a fool, and not yet purged
From his mortality.

Did we out of love
And our entire affection, of all Orchards
Choose yours to make it happy by our dances,
Light ayry measures, and fantastique rings!
And you ungrateful mortal thus requites us.
All for one Apple!

Villain thou have undone me:
His Grace is much incensed.

You know, Iocastus,
Our Grace have Orchards of our own more precious
Then mortals can have any: And we sent you
A Present of them the other day.

It Is right,
Your Graces humble servant must acknowledge it.

Some of his own I am sure.


I must confess
Their outside looked something like yours indeed;
But then the taste more relished of eternity,
The same with Nectar.

Your good Grace is welcome
To any thing I have: Nay, Gentlemen
Pray do not you spare neither:

Ti-ti-ta-te.


What say these mighty peers, great Oberon?


They cannot speak this language, but in ours
They thank you, and they say they will have none,

Ti-ti-ta-t^-Tititatie


What say they now?


They do request you now
To grant them leave to dance a Fayry ring
About your servant, and for his offense
Pinch him: do you the while command the traitor
Not dareto stir, not once presume to mutter.

Traitor, for so Prince Oberon deignes to call thee,
Stir not, nor mutter.

To be thus abused!


Ha? mutter'st thou?


I have deserved better.


Still mutter'st thou?


I see I must endure it.


Yet mutter'st thou? Now Noble Lords begi^
When it shall please your honors.

Ti ti tatie.
Our noble friend permits, Tititatie:
Do you not sir?

How should I say I do?


Ti ti ta tie.


Ti ti ta tie my Noble Lords.


Quoniam per te violamur
Vngues hic experiamur.
Statim dices tibi datam
Cutem valde variatam.

Tititatie to your Lordships for this excellent music


This it is to have a coxcombe to on's master.


Still mutter'st thou?


And rise up Sir Iocastus, our dear Knight.
Now hang the hallowed bell about his neck,
We call it a mellisonant Tingle Tangle,
(Indeed a sheep-bell stolen from's own fat wether.)
The ensign of his knighthood. Sir Iocastus,
We call to mind we promised you long since
The President of our Dances place; we are now
Pleased to confirm it on you: give him there
His Staff of Dignity.

Your Grace is pleased
To honor your poor leigeman.

Now begone.


Farewell unto your Grace and eke to you,
Tititatie my Noble Lords farewell.

Tititatie my noble fool farewell:
Now, my Nobility and honored Lords,
Our grace is pleased for to part stakes; here Iocalo
These are your share; these his, and these our Graces.
Have we not gulled him bravely! see you Rascals,
These are the fruits of witty knavery.

Heaven shield Prince Oberon, and his honored Lords!
We are betrayed.

Bow wow wow.
Nay nay since you have made a sheep of my Brother
I Will be a dog to keep him.

O good Mopsus!


Does not your Grace, most low and mighty Dorylas,

Fear whipping now?

Good Mopsus but conceal us,
And I will promise by to morrow night
To get thee Thestylis.

I will ask leave
Of the birds first. An owl? the bird of night; An owl
That plainly shows that by to morrow night, shreekes.
He may perform his promise.

And I will.


Why then I will conceal you. But your Grace
Must think your Grace beholding to me.

Well:
We do^.

And thank the owl, she stood your friend.
And for this time my witty Grace farewell.

Nay be not so discourteous; Stay and take
An apple first: you Iocalo give him one,
And you another, and our Grace a third.

Your Grace is liberal: But now I fear
I am not he that must interpret the Oracle.
My brother will prevent me, to my grief
I much suspect it, for this Dorylas
A scarre-crow cozend him most shamefully,
Which makes me fear he is a more fool then I.

So, we are clean got off: come noble Peers
Of Fairy, come, attend our Royal Grace.
Let Us go and share our fruit with our Queen Mab,
And the other Dary maids: where of this theme
We will discourse amidst our Cakes and Cream.

Cum tot poma habeamus,
Triumphos laeti iam canamus.
Faunos ego credam ortos
Tantum ut frequentent hortos.
I domum Oberon ad illas
Quae nos manent nunc ancillas.
Quarum osculemur sinum,
Inter poma, lac, and vinum.

I would have you to know The stilis, so I would,
I am no dog, but mortal flesh and blood
As you are.

O be patient gentle Mopsus.


Slid, fetch and carry!


Nay good sweet heart
Be not so angry.

Angry? why 'twould anger
A dog indeed to be so used, a dog!
I would not use a dog so: bid a dog
That comes of a good house to fetch and carry!
Discourteous! ^et him get dogs of his own,
For I have got my neck out of the collar.
Let him unkennell's Oracles himself
For Mopsus, if I starte or spring him one
I Will dye the dogs death, and be hanged: mad fool!

But Mopsus, you may now securely visit
Me and my house: Amyntas, heaven be praised,
Is now recovered of his wits again.

How? and grown wise!


Ceres be praised as ever.


Shut up your doors then; Carduus Benedictus
Or Dragon water may do good upon him.

What mean you Mopsus?


Mean I? what mean you
To invite me to your house when it is infected?

Infected?


I, Amyntas has the Wits.
And do you think I Will keep him company?
Though, as I told you still, I am suspicious
Iocastus is the man that must --

Do what?


It grieves me to think of it.


Out with it man.


That must interpret; I have cause to think
(With sorrow be it spoken) he will prove
The verier fool, but let him; yet now my Aug^ry
That never fails me, tells me certainly
That I shall have thee, Thestylis, yet ere night;
It was an owl --

-- And -- see see, Thestylis,
Here comes the Ivy bush. I Will stand aside,
For I am still most bodily afraid.
What Deity lives here? the soul of Phoebus
Breaths in this powerful man: sure Aeculapius
Revisits earth again; and in this shape
Deals health amongst us! I before was nothing
But brui^ and beast: O tell me by what relics
Of heavenly fire have you inspired me with
This better soul of reason! worthy sir,
If you are some God (as less I cannot deem you)
That pitying of my miseries, came down
From heaven to cure me, tell me, that I may
With sacrifice adore you.

Adore him?
Are there such Ruffian Gods in heaven as he?
Such beggarly Deities?

If you will conceal it,
And I by ignorance omit to pay
Those sacred duties that I ought, be pleased
To pardon me.

Heighday! well Thestylis,
You may be glad your house is not infected;
Hee'sten times madder now then ere he was,
To deify this rude ill-favored Silvan,
This fellow with the beard all over: Thestylis,
I dare not stay; unless my heels maintain
My safety I shall turn a dog again.

I am as you are, mortal; it is my skill
In Physic, and experience in the rare
Virtue of herbs, that wrought this miracle;
No Divinity, or power in me.

Amyntas, when shall we requite this kindness?


Never, I would willingly
Have sacrificed unto him, but his modesty
Will not permit it: though he will not suffer us
To Adore him as a God; yet we may pay
A reverence to him as a father.

O those words do touch the quick!


For if he be
A father that begot this flesh, this clay,
What Is he to whom we owe our second birth
Of soul and reason? Father, I must call you
By that name, father.

Now the floudgates open,
And the full stream of tears will issue out:
Traitors, you will betray me!

Sir, why weep you?


To think of this man's father -- O I loved him
As dearly as my self (my words and all
Break out suspicious!) has ^e not a daughter?
As I remember well, he said her name was --

Amaryllis.


Yes, I had almost
Forgot it, I would feign have seen her too.

You cannot now, because to night she lodged
With one Laurinda.

O my Urania, welcome,
Amyntas bids thee so, I that 'till now
Was not Amyntas: come my joy, and meet me
Full of our happiness!

Grant Ceres now
My hopes be faithful to me: my Amyntas,
How come your thoughts so settled?

O Urania,
Here, here he stands, to whom I owe my self,
And thou owe me: we reverence in our Temples
Marble, and brass, whose statues serve for nothing
But to hang cobwebs on: oh! how much rather
Should we adore this Deity, that bestowed
Such happiness upon us!

Would we knew
How to deserve it.

So you may Urania,
If you will grant me one request.

Command it.


I would entreat you presently to vow
Virginity to Ceres, that Amyntas
No more may toil his brain in thinking what
To give you for a Dowry.

Sir, I will
Presently about it, I Will only first
Get some unknown disguise.

I dare stay here
No longer, for I must begone ereyet
The light betrays me.

Happiness attend you!


Remember it Urania.


Farewell father.


Thus like a bat, or owl I spend my age
In night or darkness, as ashamed of day,
And fearful of the light: the sun and I
Dare never be acquainted. O guilt, guilt,
Thou and thy daughter fear are punishments
Perpetual, every whistling of the wind
Does seem the noise of apprehenders* shadows
Affright me more then men. Each step I tread
Is danger. Life? why to live longer should we
Not live at all: I hear a noise: false timorousness
Deceive me not, -- my eyes instruct me too,
Heaven shield me --

Fain I would enquire of them
For Amaryllis, but if one of these
Be Damon, I am lost.
How early, Damon, do lovers rise?


It Is he, I hear his name, good mole away.


No Larkes so soon, Alexis.


He that of us shall have Laurinda, Damon,
Will not be up so soon: ha! would you Damon?

Alexis, no* but if I miss Laurinda,
My sleep shall be eternal.

I much wonder the Sun so soon can rise!


Did he lay his head in fair Laurinda's lap,


We should have but short days.


No summer, Damon.


Thetis to her is brown.


And he does rise
From her to gaze on fair Laurinda's eyes.

O now I long to meet our Arbitresse.


On whom depends our only happiness.


It must be the first Virgin that we greet
From Ceres Temple.

Yes, the first we meet.


I hear no noise of any yet that move.


Devotion's not so early up as love.


See how Aurora blushes! we suppose
Where Tithon lay to night.

That modest rose
He grafted there.

O heaven, it is all I seek,
To make that color in Laurinda's cheek.

The virgins now come from the Temple.


Appeal unto the first.


Chaste beauteous Nymph,
Ceres so grant your prayers, as you determine
Justly our cause!
Ceres has heard my prayers,
For all my morning orisons begged no more
Then one kind word from Damon.

Amaryllis!


That name breaths life and soul to poor Alexis.


The same; -- why startle you? you have not met
A poison, Damon.

Yes, a thousand vipers
Have stung my soul.

As many joys crown mine
With happiness.

Would I had met this morning
Infectious vapors nursing plagues, not thee;
No curse but that had power to ruin me!

No other blessing has preserved me.


What should this mean, my Damon? how have I
Displeased you, sweet? heaven knows it is my prayer
More then for heaven, to please you.

O my torture!
Fly hence as far as hell, and hide thy head
Lower then darkness; would thou had been acting*
Incest or murder, when thou came to pray:
Thou had in any thing sinned less then this:
Unseasonable devotion!

Can it be
A sin to pray for Damon?

Thou had blessed me
Had thou sat all this while in some dark cell
Loading my head with curses.

Innocence
Let me not understand you.

I Will not stand
To her award, she is a partial judge,
And will decree unjustly.

How, to Damon?
To him she loves so dearly?

That Is the reason;
She does confess, Alexis, that she loves me,
That Is argument enough against het.

Ceres, these obscure passions move me.


I Will instruct you,
Take here the paper, pen and ink.

Why yet sir
I know no more.

You are to pass your censure,
Being the first Nymph that we have met this morning,
Which of us two must have the fair Laurinda.
Write your award; our mutual oaths do bind us
Not to deny't.

It Is a mere plot contrived
Betwixt this cursed Nymph, and you* Alexis.

Damon you wrong us both.


Where did you steal
This Garland? it was mine.

For that I love it,
Because it once was thine.

For that I hate it,
Cause it is thine, had it been true to me*
Me thinks as soon as it had touched thy head
It should have withered.

So it would have done
Had it not first touched yours. Laurinda gave me
This Garland, but nere told me of this accident.

Alexis, you deal false, it is a conspiracy
'Twixt you and her.

How can it? you know, Damon,
I have not been one minute from your presence.

You took your time while I was sleeping.


Neither,
Nor I nor you could sleep one wink this night,
The expectation of this morning trial
Did keep us both awake.

I do not know,
But there is some trick in it, and I Will appeal
From her too partial se^ence.

I Will the while go fetch Laurinda, she shall force you stand
Unto her trial.

Damon, thy harsh language is more then death
Unto me.

I do charge you to tear the paper,
And refuse to judge between us.

No, I am resolved to write what I determine.


Now thou have indeed a time wherein thou may
Revenge my scorn. Take it, but I Will prevent thee.

Welcome death!
From him all things are so. Damon, fly hence,
Thou have shed blood here in the Sacred Valley,
Make have away or thou art lost for ever.

Thy counsell's good, no matter whose the guilt.


What was it he said last? -- Thou have indeed
A time wherein thou may revenge my scorn.
-- With love, no otherwise: and there thou shall not
Prevent me, Damon. I will write -- This ink
Deserves not to record the name of Damon,
It Is black and ugly; thou thy self have furnished me
With that of better color. It Is my blood
That Is truly Cupids ink: love ought to write
Only with that; --. This paper is too course;
O that I had my heart, to write it there!
But so it is already. Would I had
A Parchment made of my own skin, in that
To write the truth of my affection,
A wonder to posterity! -- Hand make have
As my blood does, or I shall faint I fear
Ere I have done my story. --

These milkemaids are the daintiest rogues* they kiss
As sweet as sillibubs, surely Oberon
Lives a delitious life! Ha! who lies here?
A Nymph? If It were but now in Oberons power
To steal away her maidenhead, as she sleeps:
O 'twould be excellent sport, to see how she
Would miss it when she wakes: what misery it is
To be a boy; why could not my good father
Have got me five years sooner? here had been
A purchase: well, it is but five years longer
And I shall hope to see a merrier world.
No body near too! Slid the very thought's
Enough to make me man oath sudden, well
I Will kiss her though.

Oh I faint.


She dreams;
Now shall I know all secrets: These same women
Are given so much to talk when they are awake
That they prate sleeping too.

My blood congeales
Within my quill, and I can write no more.

Love letters? she was troubled yester night
About inditcing, and she dreams on it now.
Poor sleepy secretary!

I will fold it up
And send it; who is that is here? my eyes
Are dim, ha, Dorylas!

Now she dreams she gives it me to carry;
I half fear I use to carry letters in my sleep,
Wearying my self all night, and that is the reason
I am so loath to rise in the morning.

Dorylas, carry this letter for me.


I thought so,
That Is all that I can do, carry their letters,
Or run of errands: well, come five years hence
They may employ me better. Unto whom is it?

Unto Laurinda, take it.


How, a red letter?


Say I wish all health to her and Damon;
And being not able for to bear my griefs,
I sought a remedy from mine own spear and died.

How dead? oh me,
See how her blood has stained the holy Valley!
Well you have done me wrong to kill your self,
Only to have me sacrifis'd on the Altar,
I nere deserved it.

Fear not Dorylas.


Fear not, to dye so like a calfe? oh Dorylas oh --


Good Dorylas be gone, whilst yet my breath
Will give me leave to say it was not you.

See that you do, and so farewell.


Farewell!
How fearful death is unto them; whose life
Had any sweetness in it! my days have all
Been so oreworne with sorrow, that this wound
Is unto me rather a salve then fore,
More physic then disease: whither my journey
Shall lead me now; through what dark hideous place;
Among what monsters, hags and snake-hair'd Furies,
Am I to go, I know not: but my life
Has been so spotless, chaste, and innocent,
My death so undeserved, I have no reason
(If there be Gods) but to expect the best;
Yet what does most torment me, is the thought
How long 'twill be ere I again enjoy
My Damon's presence: until then, Elysium
Will be no place of pleasure; and perchance
When he comes thither too, he then may slight me
As much as now. -- That very fear does make thee
Dye, wretched Amaryllis!

How no fear
Can make me loose the father! Death or danger
Threat what you can; I have no heart to go
Back to the mountains, 'till my eyes have seen
My Amaryllis!

O was ever love
So cros'd as mine! was ever Nymph so wretched
As Amaryllis?

Ha! I heard the sound
Of Amarillis; where is that blessed creature,
That owes the name? are you the Virgin?

Yes,
That fatal name is mine. I shall anon
Be nothing but the name.

O speak, what hand,
What barbarous Tigers issue, what cursed whelpe
Of Bears or Lion, had the marble heart
To wound so sweet a Nymph?

O sir, my blood
Calls none but fortune guilty. I by chance
Stumbled on mine own dart, and hurt my self.*

Then I have herbs to cure it: heaven I thank thee
That did instruct me hither! still the blood
Flows like a scarlet torrent, whose quick stream
Will not be checked: speak Amarillis, quickly,
What hand this sin has stained, upon whose soul
This blood writes murder; till you see the man
Before your eyes, that gave the hurt, all hope
In Physic is despair: -- She will not speak,
And now the cure grows to the last. Yet here
I have a Recipe will revive her spirits,
And 'till the last drop of her blood be clean
Exhausted from those azure veins, preserve her;
But then she is lost for ever! Then, O Ceres,
If there be any in these groves, men, virgins,
Beast, bird, or trees, or any thing detesting
This horrid fact, reveal it! Sacred grass
Whose hallowed green this bloody deed has stained,
Ask nature for a tongue to name the murderer!
I Will to the Temple: -- If this place contain
Any Divinity, Piety, or Religion,
If there be any God at home, or Priest,
Ompha, or Oracle, Shrine, or Altar, speak
Who did it: who is guilty of this sin,
That dies the earth with blood, and makes the heavens
Ashamed to stand a witness?

What sad voice
Disturbs our pious Orgyes?

See, Pilumnus,
A virgin all in gore.

Ceres defend us,
The Sacred Valley is profaned.

The place
So dear to Ceres, all defiled with blood.

By Ceres, and her holy Ompha, he
That did it, with his blood shall satisfy
The Goddess anger; who by blood offends
By his own sacrificed, must make amends.

I durst presume upon the power of art,
Did I but know the murderer.

How soever
It Is death to him that did it.

Speak his name
Fair virgin.

O -- if it be death to him
That did it, I have not the power to live
Behind him.

Why, who was it then?


My self,
And therefore in my death your law is satisfied,
The blood and act both mine.

It is not so,
For had it been by her own hand, my skill
Could have preserved her life.

It was my self,
Or one as dear.

Who Is that?


I Will rather dye
Then name him, though it be a name I use
Often to repeat, and every repetition
Is a new soul unto me: it is a name
I have taught the birds to caroll, every
Laurel and Cedar bears it registered
Upon his tender bark; it is a name
In which is all the life I yet have left;
A name I long to speak; yet I had rather
Dye all the several sorts of death twice over
Then speak it once.

I charge thee by that duty
Thou ow'st to me, Amarillis, that thou owe to me
Who gave thee life. --

What should this mean Corymbus!


And by the womb that bare thee, by the breasts
Of thy dead mother, Lalage,

This is strange.


Conceal him not! in plain, I am thy father
Thy father, Amarillis, that commands thee
By these gray hairs to tell me. I am Claius.

How, Claius! and so fortunatly found!


I, glut your hate, Pilumnus; let your soul
That has so long thirsted to drink my blood,
Swill till my veins are empty; and carowse
Deep in my heart, till you grow drunk, and reele,
And vomit up the surfeit, that your cruelty
Quaft off with so much pleasure; I have stood
Long like a fatal oak, at which great Jove
Levels his thunder; all my boughs long since
Blasted and withered; now the trunk falls too.
Heaven end thy wrath in me!

Blessed be Ceres!
What unexpected happiness is here?
Rejoice Sicilians; miserable lovers,
Crown all your brows with roses, and adore
The Deity that sent him: he is come
Whose blood must quench the fire of Ceres wrath,
And kindle more auspitious flames of love
In every breast.

I, do, I fear not death.
Let every Virgins hand when I am slain
Ring me a knell of Plaudits: let my Dirges
Be amorous Ditties, and in stead of weeping
Dance at my funeral! It Is no grief for me
To dye to make my countrymen some sport.
Here Is one in whom I only wish to live
Another age.

What joy have I to live,
That nere lived yet: the time that I have spent
Since first I wept, then, when I first had entrance
Into this world, this cold and sorrowful world,
Was but a scene of sorrow; wretched I!
Fatal to both my parents! For my birth
Ruined my mother, and my death my father.
O Tragic life! I either should have been
Nere borne, or nere have died. When I began
To be, my sin began, why should it then
Out live me? for, though now I cease to be,
That still continues: Eyes, flow forth a pace,
And be ashamed to see my wound run blood
Faster then you drop tears --
See, here he comes.
His absence never until now I wished.

My Conscience brings me back, the feet of guilt
Go slow and dull, it is hard to run away
From that we bear about us!

The Murderer
Is in this place, the issue of her blood
Is stopped oth' sudden. Cruel man, it is thou
Have done this bloody act, that will disgrace
The story of our nation, and imprint
So deep a blemish in the age we live in
For savage Barbarism, that eternity
Shall nere wear out: Pilumnus, on my knees
I beg the justice of Sicilian laws
Against this monster.

Claius, it is your hate,
And old revenge instructs you to accuse
My Son: you would have fellows in your death,
And to that purpose you pretend, I know not
What mysteries of art!

Speak Amaryllis
Is It not this wolf?

Say, virgin, was it he?


O, I am angry with my blood for stopping!
This coward ebb against my will betraies me;
The stream is turned, my eyes run faster now.

Can you accuse my son?


By Ceres, no;
I have no heart to do it: does that face
Look cruel? do those eyes sparkle with hate,
Or malice? Tell me, Father, looks that brow
As if it could but frown? Say, can you think
It Is possible Damon could have the heart
To wound a Virgin? surely barbarous cruelty
Dwells not in such a breast: mercy, and mildness,
Courtesy, love, and sweetness breath in him,
Not Anger, wrath, or murder; Damon was not
Fed at a Thracian teat, Venus did send
Her Doves to nurse him, and can he be cruel?
Whence should he learn so much of barbarism
As thus to wrong a Virgin? if he wound me
It Is only from his eyes, where loves blind God
Whets his pil'd arrows; He besides, you know,
Had never cause to wrong me, for he knows
Always I loved him: Father, do not wrong
An innocent; his soul is white, and pure,
It Is sin to think there lives a sin in him;
Impiety to accuse him.

In his looks
He carries guilt, whose horror breeds this strange
And obstinate silence: shame, and his conscience
Will not permit him to deny it.

It Is, alas,
His modest, bashful nature, and pure innocence,
That makes him silent: think you that bright rose
That buds within his cheeks, was planted there
By guilt or shame? no, he has always been
So unacquainted with all act of sin,
That but to be suspected strikes him dumb
With wonder and amazement. For by Ceres
(I think my oath be lawful) I my self
Was cause of this.

Still I am confident
'Twas he.

It is your envy makes you so.


-- I will Alexis,
And so he must if oaths be any tie.

To lovers they are none, we break those bonds
As easily as threads of silk: A bracelet
Made of your maidens haire's a stronger chain
Then twenty cobweb oaths, which while we break
Venus but laughs: it must be your persuasion
That works him to it.

Damon, you must stand
To what you promised, how shall I believe
Those other oaths you swear, if you respect
This one no better: It was my device
To have her judge, was it not, Amarillis?
How, all in blood!

Yes, this unmercifull man
(If he be man that can do such a crime)
Has wounded her.

Indeed it was not he.


You see her self frees him.


When last we left her
She was with Damon.

Pray believe her not,
She speaks it out of anger, I nere saw
Damon to day before.

And when we left 'em
He was incensed.

You are no competent witness;
You are his Rival in Laurinda's love,
And speak not truth but malice, it is a plot
To ruin innocence.

O ungrateful man!
The wolf that does devour the breast that nursed it
Is not so bad as thou: here, here, this Letter
The eternal Chronicle of affection,
That ought with golden characters to be writ
In Cupids Annals, will (false man) convince thee
Of foul ingratitude: you shall hear me read it.
Laurinda, you have put it unto me
To choose a husband for you, I will be
A judge impartial, upright, just and true,
Yet not so much unto my self as you.

Now I expect to hear my blessed doom.


Alexis well deserves, but Damon more;
I wish you him I wished my self before.

O, I am ruined in the height of hope.
How like the herb Solstitiall is a lover,
Now borne, now dead again, he buds, sprouts forth,
Flourishes, ripens, withers in a minute.

Take him, the best of men, that ever eye
Beheld, and live with him for whom I dye.
Amarillis.
Here look on it. --

Writ with blood? o let me kiss
My bill of Accusation! here my name
Looks like my soul, all crimson, every line,
Word, syllable, and letter, wears the livery
Of my unnatural action. Amarillis
That name of all is black, which was alone
Worthy so precious ink; as if disdaining
The character of cruelty, which the rest
Were cloathd in: for as if that word alone
Did wear this mourning color, to bewail
The funeral of my virtue, that lies buried
Here in this living tomb, this moving sepulcher.

Know murderer I hate thy bed, and thee,
Unkind, unthankful villain.

Nay, Laurinda,
You have bound your self to stand to my award;
The sentence now is past, and you must love him,
It cannot be reversed; you are deceived,
He is not guilty of this sin, his love
To me, for mine, makes him against his conscience
Seem to confess it, but believe him not.

Nor will, he is all falsehood, and ingratitude.


Laurinda, you may spare in this harsh language
To utter your dislike: had you a beauty
More then immortal, and a face whose glory
Far outshind Angels, I would make my choice
Here, and no where but here; her virtue now
Moves a more noble flame within my breast
Then ere your beauty did; I am enamored
More of her soul, then ever yet I doted
Upon your face: I do confess the fact;
Pardon me virtuous maid, for though the action
Be worthy death, the object most condemns me!
Take me to death Corymbus; Amarillis,
I go to write my story of repentance
With the same ink, wherewith thou wrotes before
The legend of thy love, farewell, farewell.

Laurinda, and Alexis, do you call
The Sheapheards, and the virgins of Sicilia
To see him sacrificed, whose death must make
There loves more fortunate; this day shall be
Happy to all Sicilians, but to me.
Yet come thou cursed Claius, the sweet comfort
Which I shall take when my revenge is done,
Will something ease the sorrow for my son.

Amarillis, prithee call Amyntas to me,
And Thestylis: I feign would have mine eye
Behold them once again before I dye.

Come my Laurinda, through how many chances,
Suspicions, errors, sorrows, doubts, and fears
Love leads us to our pleasures; many storms
Have we sailed through my Sweet, but who could fear
A tempest, that had hope to harbor here.

All, all but the distressed Amarillis
Are happy, or less wretched; fair Laurinda
Is ready for a wedding, old Pilumnus
Has lost a son, yet mitigates his grief
In Claius death, my father Claius dies
Yet joys to have the son of his old enemy
A partner of his sorrows; my father looses
Only himself; and Damon too no more;
Amyntas but a father, only I
Have lost all these; I have lost Claius, Damon,
And my self too; A father with Amyntas,
And all the rest in Damon, and which more
Affects me, I am cause of all; Pilumnus
Had not else lost his son, nor had Amyntas
Wept for a Father, nor poor Thestylis
Bewailed a brother; Damon might have lived,
And Claius but for me; all circumstances
Concurreto make my miseries complete,
And sorrows perfect: for I lost my father
As soon as I had found him, and my Damon
As soon as I had found he loved me: thus
All I can find is loss; o too too wretched,
Distressed virgin! when they both are dead
Visit their Ashes, and first weep an hour
On Claius Vrne, then go, and spend another
At Damon's; thence again go wet the tomb
Of thy dead father, and from thence return
Back to thy lovers grave; thus spend thy age
In sorrows; and till death do end thy cares
Betwixt these two equally share thy tears.

COme neighbors, let us go see the sacrifice
Must make you happy lovers: oh 'twill be
A fortunate season! Father Coridon,
You and old mother Baucis shall be friends.
The sheepe-hooke and the distaffe shall shake hands.
You lovely freeze-coats, nothing now but kissing,
Kissing and culling, culling and kissing, heighday!
In hope it will be one day so with me
I am content to live. Now let us ascend.

Now my Laurinda, now (o happy now!)
All lets that stood between my joy and me
Are gone and fled.

Long, o too long, Alexis,
My doubtful fancy wavered whom to love,
Damon, or you; in both was happiness,
But double happiness was my single misery:
So fared it once, Alexis, (for I well
Remember it) with one of my poor ewes,
Equally moved between two tufts of grass,
This tempting one way, that enticing to other,
Now she would this, then that, then this again,
Until poor fool (true emblem of her mistress)
She almost starved in choosing which to feed on;
At last (so heaven pitied the innocent fool)
A western gale nipt one, which being blasted
She fed upon the other.

Pretty fool! lets now no more defer our nuptial (joys.


How sweet a folly is this love? But rash youth, Alexis,
(As youth is rash) runs indiscreetly on
While mature judgment ripened by experience
Stays for loves season.

Season? why, can love
Be ever out of season?

Yes, Alexis,
Nothing's borne ripe, all things at first are green,

Lau. And such shall our affection still be seen.


You are to hasty reapers that do call
For Sickles in the spring:

Loves, harvest shall;
(Lovers you know) his harvest ought to be
All the year long.

In Cupids husbandry,
Who reapes not in the spring, reapes not at all.

Women indeed too soon begin their fall.
Yet till cursed Claius dye, as now he must,
Alexis, and Laurinda, let my counsel
Assuage the heat of youth; pray be persuaded
A while for to defer your nuptial bliss;
It Is but a while.

A while in lov's an age.


Maids in a while grow old.


Temper loves fire.


It Is but cold love that is temperate in desire.


Yet, loving pair, stay 'till a fayrer gale;
He deserves shipwreck, ('it is the Mariners flout)
And justly too, that in a storm sets out.

I will suppress my flame, (ah still it glowes.)


And I, but how unwilling Cupid knows!


It Is well; now let us go take our place, to see
For our sad griefs a sadder remedy.

-- Yes, it was he: he is in the temple brother,
A place wherein he does deserve a shrine,
Yet is to him a prison; can you Gods
Suffer the place that is reard unto your honors
Be made so vile a thing?

Pray give me entrance:
I am not mad, (and yet I would I were)
Am I not mad to wish so? Let me come
And see him, sure you had your self a father.
Did you not wish to see him ere he died?
If he be dead: we will only pray a while,
And weep; will tears pollute the hallowed Ompha?
For we must shed them, yes, we cannot choose:
Come sister, he will let us, for though Lalage
Was our sad mother, yet the Gods will let us
Weep for her: come, come Amarillis, come.

Brother, aread, what means his graces favor?


It signifies you bear the bell away,
From all his Graces nobles.

Divinely Augur'd;
For this I Will make thee Augur to his grace.

Belwether of Knighthood, you shall bind me to you.


I Will have't no more a sheep-bell; I am Knight
Of the Mellisonant Tingle tangle.

Sure one of my progeny; tell me gracious brother,
Was this Mellisonant Tingle tangle none
Of old Actaeons hounds?

Ignorant mortal,
Thou do not understand the terms of honor.

How should I sir, my trees bear no such apples:


As mine, th'Hesperian fruit are crabbs to mine,
Hence came the Knighthood, hence.

The fame whereof rings loud.


We know it.


Four such knight-hoods more
Would make an excellent peale.

I Will have 'em so.


But you must get a squirell too.


For what?


To ring your Knight-hoods.


I Will have any thing,
His grace will not deny me, o sweet orchard.

To see the fruit that came of such an orchard!


But shall we not see Claius sacrificed?


Oh by all means.


But how deserved he death?


No matter for deserving it or no;
It Is fit he suffer for example sake.

And not offend?


It Is fit he should offend.


Sicilians, Nature and religion
Are at contention in me: my sad soul
Divided 'twixt my Goddess and my son,
Would in her strange distractions, either have me
Turn Parricide or Apostate: Awefull Ceres,
For whom I feed the fattest of my Lambs,
To whom I send the holiest of my prayers
Upon the smoaky wings of sweetest myrrh,
Instruct thy doubtful Flamen! As I cannot
Forget I am thy priest: for sooner shall
Our Lambs forget to feed, our swains to sing,
Our Bees forget first, from the fruitful Thyme
To cull them baggs of Nectar: everything
Forget his nature, ere I can forget
I am thy Priest: Nor can I but remember
That Damon is my son: yet take him Ceres!
You need not power water upon his head,
I Will do it with my tears. Ceres, I hope
Thy anger will not bind the Fathers eye
To look into the Bowels of his son,
I Will therefore first spill on thy hallowed Altar
This Captives blood; and then retire my self
Not to be present at my Damons death
Least nature might turn Rebel to devotion.
Ceres, to whom we owe that yet
We do not Mast and Acornes eat:
That did provide us better meat,
The purest flower of finest wheat.
This blood we spill at thy desire,
To kindle, and to quench a ire.
O let it quench thy flame of fire,
And kindle mercies more entire.
O let this guilty blood atone
For every poor unlucky one;
Nymph, or Swain, who ere do groan
Under sad Loves imperious throne.
That Love a happier age may see
In thy long tortured Sicily.
That blood which must the Atonement be
Thus Goddess, thus, we pay to thee!

Stay, stay that impious hand, whose hasty zeal
Thinks murder can appease the Goddess wrath!
If it be murder must appease her wrath,
What is it can move her anger? Do not then,
Do not pollute her Altar, least it keep
The crimson stain of blood, and blush for ever,
At this too cruel, ignorant devotion.

Avoid the mad man.


Why Pilumnus, Why?
By the dread Ompha, spare this guilty blood,
And I Will expound the Oracle.

What fire has yet his blood or quenched or kindled?


Why it has quenched the sadder flames of love,
And more auspitious fires begin to move.

Where? in what breast? No love in all Trinacria
But under Cupids scepter faints and groans
More now then ever. Thy unfortunate Damon,
And more unfortunate Amarillis stand
A sad example; Thy Urania
(O sad sweet name!) may with her poor Amyntas
Witness his tyrannous reign: here in Sicilia
Turtles grow jealous, Doves are turned unchaste,
The very Pellica^s of Trinacria^ woods
Are found unnatural, and thirst the blood
Of their young brood, (alas who can believe it?)
Whom they were wont to suckle with their own.
O wretched season! Bitter fruits of love!
The very Storks with us are Parricides.
Nay even the senseless trees are sensible
Of this imperious rage: the gentle Vine
(The happy emblem once of happier Lovers)
That with such amorous twines, and close embraces
Did cling about the loved-loving elm,
With slacker branches now falls down and withers:
If then to add more fuel to the flame,
To power in oil and sulphur be to quench it,
The flame is quenched. Nor are you he, Pilumnus,
That must expound the Oracle, It Is a wit
Such as mine is neglected, that must hit
The Goddess meaning: you, the living Oracle
Of Sicilie, the breathing Ompha of the Kingdom
Will misconceive the Goddess; you are wise
Skilled in the virtues of all herbs, and flowers,
What makes our Ewes ean best, what keeps the^ sound;
Can tell us all the mysteries of heaven,
The number, height, and motion of the stars;
It Is a mad brain, an intellect, you scorn
That must unty this riddle.

But I know
The wrath of Ceres cannot be appeased
But by the blood of Claius.

So it is.


How can that be? yet his accursed gore
Has not imbrued the Altar.

But his blood
Has been already shed in Amarillis:
She is his blood, so is Urania yours,
And Damon is your blood; That is the blood
The Goddess aims at, that must still her ire,
For her blood has both quenched and kindled fire.

What has it quenched or kindled?


Love, the fire
That must be quenched and kindled. Damons love
To his Laurinda in that blood extinguished,
Is by that powerful blood kindled anew
To Amarillis, now grown his desire:
Thus Claius blood has quenched and kindled fire.

Amyntas, Amyntas, Amyntas, Amyntas.


And is the fire of my Damon kindled
But to be quenched again: Ceres! a frost
Dwell on thy Alters, ere my zeal renew
Religious fires to warme'em.

Spare these blasphemies,
For Damon is acquitted and affoil'd
Of any trespass.

How Amyntas? speak!
Thou that have saved a Father, save a son.

Thus, Amarillis is the Sacrifice
The Goddess aimed at: and the blood of Sacrifice
(As you all know) may lawfully be spilt
Even in the Holy vale, and so it was;
Besides your Damon is a Priest by birth,
And therefore by that Title, he may spill
The sacrifized Amarillis blood.
If this interpretation be not true,
Speak you Sicilians, I Will be judged by you.

Amyntas, Amyntas, Amyntas, Amyntas.


Amyntas, thou have now made full amends
For my Philebus death; Claius all envy,
Envy the viper of a venomous soul
Shall quit my breast: This is the man, Sicilians,
The man to whom you owe your liberties;
Go Virgins, and with Roses strew his way,
Crown him with violets, and lilly wreathes;
Cut off your golden tresses, and from them
Weave him a robe of love: Damon, pay here
The debt of duty that thou ow'st to me;
Hence was thy second birth.

Or hither rather:
The Balsame of Sicilia flowed from hence,
Hence from this scarlet torrent, whose each drop
Might ransom Cupid were he captive taken.

How much owe I my Damon, whose blessed hand
Made me the public sacrifice! could I shed
As many drops of blood, even from the heart,
As Arethusa drops of water can,
I would outvie her at the fullest tide,
That other Virgins loves might happy be,
And mine my Damon be as blessed in thee.

O what a shower of joy falls from mine eyes!
The now too fortunate Claius! my Amyntas,
My Amarillis, how shall I divide
My tears and joys betwixt you!

Lovers come,
Come all with flowery chaplets on your brows,
And singing Hymmes to Ceres, walk around
This happy village; to express our glee
This day each year shall Cupids triumphs be.

Still my impossible Dowry for Urania
Leaves me unfortunate in the midst of joy;
Yet out of piety I will here a while
(Though blessed I am not 'till she be my bride)
In public joys lay private griefs aside.

And I Will go fetch the youngsters of the town,
The mortal Fairies, and the lasses brown,
To bring spic'd cakes, and ale, to dance and play,
Queen Mab her self shall keep it holy day.

Ah Dorilas that I could not have the wit
To have been a mad man rather then a fool.
I have lost the credit.

It Is no matter
You shall have Thestylis,

Shall I, Dorylas,
I had as live interpret her as Oracles.

And here she comes, give me your quail pipe, hark you. --


Now, Thestylis, thou shall mine Oracle be,
Hence forth I will interpret none but thee.

Why have the birds (my Mopsus) councel'd so?


They say I must, whether you will or not.


How know I that?


The birds do speak it plain.
Hark, Thestylis, the birds say so again.

I understand them not.


Will you be judged
By th'next we meet?

Mopsus, I am content,
So you will stand unto it as well as I.

By Ceres, Thestylis, most willingly.


Ah Dorilus, heard you what the birds did say?


I Mopsus, you are a happy man to day.


What said they boy?


As if you did not know.


But Thestylis.


Why sure she understands it,
Have you to her this language never read?

No, Dorylas, I can teach her best in bed.


The Birds said twice: (as you full well do know)
You must have Thestylis whether she will or no.

And am I caught? It Is no great matter though;
For this time Mopsus I will marry thee;
The next I wed, by Pan, shall wiser be!

And have I got thee? thanks my witty boy.


Hark, Thestylis, the birds do bid you joy.


For fooling Mopsus, now it is time give ore.


Mad man I may, but will be fool no more.


Mad after marriage as a fool before.
For he is a fool that weds, all wives being bad;
And she is a fool makes not her husband mad.

See, Mopsus, see, here comes your Fairy brother,
Hark you, for one good turn deserves another.

I did not think there had been such delight
In any mortal Morris, they do caper
Like quarter Fairies at the least: by my Knighthood,
And by this sweet Mellisonant Tingle tangle,
The ensign of my glory, you shall be
Of Oberons Revels.

What to do I pray?
To dance away your Apples.

Surely mortal,
Thou art not fit for any office there.

See, blind mortal, see,
With what a port, what grace, what majesty
This princely Oberon comes, your Grace is welcome.

A beauteous Lady, bright, and rare,
Queen Mab her self is not so fair.

Does your grace take me for a woman then?


Yes beauteous virgin; Thy each part
Has shot an arrow through my heart;
Thy blazing eye, thy lip so thin,
Thy azure cheek, and crystal chinne,
Thy rainbow brow, with many a rose;
Thy saphyre ears, and ruby nose,
All wound my soul, O gentle be
Or Lady you will ruin me.

Bromius, what shall I do? I am no woman!
If geelding of me will preserve your grace,
With all my heart.

No master, let him rather
Steal away all your orchard Apples.

I and shall,
Beauteous Queen Mab may loose her longing else.

How Is this? are you no woman then?
Can such bright beauty live with men?

An't please your grace I am your Knight Iocastus.


Indeed I thought no man but he
Could of such perfect beauty be.

Cannot your Grace distill me to a woman.


I have an herb, they Moly call,
Can change thy shape (my sweet) and shall.
To taste this Moly but agree,
And thou shall perfect woman be.

With all my heart; nere let me move
But I am up to the ears in love.
But what if I do marry thee?

My Queen Iocasta thou shall be:


Sweet Moly! pray let Bromius have some Moly too,
He Will make a very pretty waiting maid.

No indeed forsooth, you have Ladies enough already.


Half your estate then give to me,
Else, you being gone, there none will be,
Whose Orchard I dare here frequent.

Sweet Oberon, I am content.


The other half let Mopsus take.


And Thestylis a jointure make.


Why master, are you mad?


Your mistrisse sirrah.
Our grace has said it, and it shall be so.

What, will you give away all your estate?


We have enough beside in Fairy land.
You Thestylis shall be our maid of honor.

I humbly thank your Grace.


Come Princely Oberon,
I long to taste this Moly: pray bestow
The Knighthood of the Mellisonant Tingle tangle,
Upon our brother Mopsus, we will raise
All of our house to honors.

Gracious sister!


I always thought I was borne to be a Queen.


Come let us walk, majestique Queen,
Of Fairy mortals to be seen.
In chaires of Pearl thou placed shall be,
And Empresses shall envy thee,
When they behold upon our throne
Iocasta with her -- Dorilas.

Ha, ha, ha!


Am I deceived and cheated, guld and foold?


Alas sir you were borne to be a Queen.


My lands, my livings, and my orchard gone?


Your grace has said it, and it must be so.


You have enough beside in Fairy land.


What would your Grace command your maid of honor?


Well I restore your lands: only the orchar'd
I will reserve for fear Queen Mab should long.

Part I Will restore unto my liberal sister
In leiw of my great Knighthood.

Part give I.


I am beholding to your liberality.


I Will some thing give as well as do the rest,
Take my fools coat, for you deserve it best.

I shall grow wiser.


Oberon will be glad on it


I must go call Urania that she may
Come vow Virginity.

Ceres, I do thank thee,
That I am author of this public joy:
But is it justice (Goddess) I alone
Should have no share in it? Every one I see
Is happy but my self that made 'em so,
And my Urania that should most be so.
I thirst amidst the Bowls; when others sit
Quaffing off Nectar, I but hold the cup;
And stand a sadder Tantalus of love,
Starving in all this plenty; Cere's Demand
Feeds me with gall; stretching my doubtful thoughts
On many thousand racks: I would my Dowry
Was all the gold of Tagas, or the ore
Of bright Pactolus channel: -- But, Urania,
It Is hid, alas I know not what it is.

My Thestylis, since first the Sea-gods Trident
Did rule the small three pointed piece of earth
Of this our conquering soil, it has not been
A place of so much story as to day,
So full of wonders: O 'twill serve (my Thestylis)
For our discourse when we go fol'd our Ewes,
Those Sheapheards that another day shall keep
Their Kiddes upon these mountains shall for ever
Relate the miracle to their wondering Nymphs,
Of my Urania; it will fill their ears
With admiration.
Sir, Vrania's here.


How! in this habit! This me thinks befits not
A Lover, my Urania.

Yes, Amyntas.
This habit well befits a Virgins life.
For since my Dowry never can be paid
Thus for thy sake I Will live and dye a maid.

O is it just, so fair a one as you
Should vow Virginity? must the sacred womb
Of my Urania fit to have brought forth
A fruitful race of Gods, be ever barren?
Never expect Lucina? shall this beauty
Live but one age? how cursed is our posterity
That shall have no Vrania's! can one Tomb
Contain all goodness? Ceres rather blast
The corn thou gav'st us: let the earth grow barren;
These trees, and flowers wither eternally;
Let our Plowes toil in vain; and let there be
No more a harvest: Every loss is small,
Yea though the Phaenix self should burn to ashes
And nere revive again! But let there be
Some more Vrania's --

It Is necessity,
We must obey.

But yet Urania,
I hope we may sometimes come pray together;
It Is not profane, and midst our sacred Orisons
Change a chaste kiss or two; or shall I too
Turn Virgin with thee? -- But I fool my self,
The Gods intend to cross us, and in vain
We strive ( Urania) to cross them again.

Great Ceres, for thy daughter Proserpines sake
Ravished by Pluto from Sicilian plains
To reign with him Queen of Elysian shades,
Accept the sacrifice of a Virgin, for
It is thy Pleasure, thine, by whom the earth
And every thing grows fruitful, to have me
Be ever barren: Thy impossible Dowry,
Makes me despair to be Amyntas bride;
Therefore that cold chaste snow that never should
Have melted but betwixt his amorous arms
I vow unto thy Cloister (Awful Goddess!)
Almighty Ceres, is not this life holy

Folly.


Better then live in an unhappy love?

Happy love*


Be judge ye woods, and let Amyntas speak.

Amyntas, speak.


The Goddess is well pleased, she daines to answer
By gracious Echo's; go Amyntas speak.

Why, will she answer me before Urania?
No, 'twas the music of her Angels voice,
Whose heavenly Accents with such charming notes
Ravished the Goddess ears, she could not choose
But bear a part in that harmonious song;
Yet if she will after such melody
Endure to hear the harsh Amyntas speak.

Amyntas, speak.


When will thou think my torments are enough?

Now.


Alas, how is it possible I should hope it?

Hope it.


How shall I pay the Dowry that you ask me?

Ask me.


I ask a Dowry to be made a Husband.

A Husband.


Answer directly to what I said last.

What I said last.


A Husband, Ceres? Why is that the guess?

Yes.


That which I have not, may not, cannot have, --
I have not, may not, cannot have a Husband.
It Is true, I am a man, nor would I change
My sex, to be the Empress of the world.
Urania, take thy Dowry, it is my self;
A Husband, take it.

It Is the richest Dowry
That ere my most ambitious prayers could beg*
But I will bring a portion, my Amyntas,
Shall equal it, if it can equaled be:
That which I have not, may not, cannot have
Shall be thy portion, it is a wife, Amyntas

Should greater Queens woo me in all their Pride,
And in their laps bring me the wealth of worlds,
I should prefer this portion before the best*
Thanks Ceres, that have made us both be blessed.

Be blessed.


Pilumnus, let us now grow young again,
And like two trees robbed of their leafy boughs
By winter, age, and Boreas keener breath,
Sprout forth and bud again: This spring of joy
Cuts forty years away from the gray sum.
Once more in triumph let us walk the Village!

But first I will entreat this company
To deigne to take part in this public joy.
All Loves are happy, none with us there be,
Now sick of coyness, or unconstancy.
The wealthy sums of Kisses do amount
To greater scores then curious art can count!
Each eye is fixed upon his Mistress face,
And every arm is locked in some embrace.
Each cheek is dimpled; every lip does smile:
Such happiness I wish this blessed Isle,
This little world of Lovers: and least you
Should think this bliss no real joys, nor true,
Would every Lady in this orb might see
Their Loves as happy as we say they be!
And for you gentle youths, whose tender hearts
Are not shot proof against love and Cupids darts;
These are my Prayrs, (I would those prayrs were charms)
That each had here his Mistrisse in his arms.
True Lovers, (for it is truth gives love delight)
To you our Authors only means to wright.
If he have pleased (as yet he doubtful stands)
For his applause clap lips instead of Hands.
He beggs nor Bays, nor Ivy; only this,
Seal his wished Plaudite with an amorous Kiss.
