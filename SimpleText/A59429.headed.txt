Your charity for this Crippled piece we pray
We are only losers if you damn the play

SIR, give me leave, as by my duty bound,
To let you know (though I am lately come
Into your Family) I have observed
(For all your real courtesy, and seeming mirth
Among your Friends that visit you) a fixed
And constant melancholy does possess you, Sir,
When you are alone, and you seem not to relish
The happiness your ample fortune, and
The great esteem your worth has ever gained
From all good men might give you, I am bound
To inquire the Cause, and offer my Advice.

Pray search no further, I, for once, can pardon
The rashness of your curiosity.
I did not take you for my Councellor.

You now, Sir, are become one of my Flock:
And I am bound in Conscience to Advise,
And search into the troubles of your spirit,
To find the secrets that disturb your mind.

I do not wonder that a Parson should
Be foolish and pragmatical; but know,
I will advise and teach your Master of Artship
(That made you lord it over Boys and Fr^shmen)
To add to your small Logic and Divinity
Two main Ingredi^nts, Sir, Sense and Good-manners,

Consider, Sir, the Dignity of my Func^ion.

Your Father is my Tailor, you are my Servant.
And d^ you think a Cassock and a Girdle
Can (...) you so much, as to enable
You (who before were but a Coxcomb, Sir,)
To t^ach me? Know, I only took you for
A me^hanick ^^vine, to read Church Prayers
Twice every day, and once a week to Teach
My Servants Honesty and Obedience.
You may (...) to a silly Flock,
And leadem where you please, but ne^re must hope
To govern men of sense and knowledge.

My Office bids me say this is profane,
And little less than Athiestical.

You're insolent, you're one of the senceless,
H^theaded Fools, that injure all your Tribe;
Learn of the wise, the moderate and good,
Our Church abounds with such examples for you.
I (...) the name of Atheist, you^re ill-manner^d.
But who ere touches one of you hot-spur Parsons,
You brand him home, and right, or wrong, no matter.

My Orders give me Authority to speak.

Your Orders separate, and set you apart
To Minister, That is to serve in Churches,
And not to domine^r in Families.

A power Legantine I have from Heaven.

Show your Credentials. Come good petulant
Mr. (...)-L^gick, pack up your for Books
And ^ld Black threadbare Clothes to morrow-morning,
And have my House; get you a Wall-ey^d Mare,
Will carry double, for your Spouse and you;
When some ^ast Chambermaid shall smile upon you,
Charmed with a Vic^aridge of forty pound
A year, the greatest you can (...).

Good Sir! I have offended, and am sorry.
I (...) will once c^mmit this fault again,
Now I am acquainted with your Worships mind*

So, now you are not bound in Conscience then.
The indiscretion of such paultry fellows
Are scandals to the Church and Cause they Preach for.
What fatal mi^chiefs have domestic Priests
Brought on the best of Families in England!
Where their dull Patrons give them line enough,
First with the Women they insinuate,
(Whose fear and folly makes them slaves t'you,)
And give them ill opinions of their Husbands.
Often ye divide them if the women rule not.
But, if they govern, then your reign is sure.
Then y' have the secrets of the Family,
Dispose oth' Children, place and then displace,
Whom, and when you think fit.

Good, Noble Sir! I humbly shall desist.

The Husband must not drink a Glass, but when
You shall, of your good grace, think fit for him.
None shall be welcome but whom you approve:
And all this favor is, perhaps, requited
With the infusing of ill principles into the Sons,
And stealing, or corrupting of the Daughters.
Sometimes upon a weak and bigot Patron you
Obtain so much to be Executor:
And, if he dies, marry his Widow, and
Claim then the cheating of his Orphans too.

Sweet Sir forbear, I am fully sensible.

With furious zeal you press for Discipline,
With fire and blood maintain your great Diana.
Foam at the mouth when a Dissenter's named,
(With fiery eyes, wherein we flaming see
A persecuting spirit) you roar at
Those whom the wisest of your function strive
To win by gentleness and easy ways.
You dam em if they do not love a Surplice.

Had I the power, I Would make them wear pitched Surplices,
And light them till they flamed about their Ears
I would --

Such Firebrands as you but hurt the Cause.
The learned and the wisest of your Tribe
Strive by good life and meekness to overcome them.
We serve a Prince renowned for Grace and Mercy,
Abhorring ways of Blood and Cruelty;
Whose Glory will, for this, last to all Ages.
Him Heaven preserve long quiet in his Throne.
I will have no such violent Sons of Thunder,
I will have moderation in my House.

Forgive my zeal, and, if your Worship please,
I will submit to all your wise Instructions.

Then (on your good behavior) I receive you,
Search not the secrets of my House or me.
Vain was our Reformation, if we still
Suffer auricular Confession here,
By which the Popish Clergy rule the world.
No business in my Family shall concern you;
Preach nothing but good life and honesty.

I will not.

No controversial Sermons will I hear:
No meddling with Government; you are ignorant
(...) Laws and Customs of cur Realm, and should be so.
The other world should be your care, not this.
A Plowman is as fit to be a Pilot,
As a good Clergyman to be a Statesman, Sir,
Besides, the People are not apt to love you,
Because your sloth is supported by their labors.
And you do hurt to any Cause you would
Advance.

I humbly bow, Sir, to your Wisdom.

A meek and humble modest Teacher be;
For pitteous tri^les you Divines fall out.
If you must Quarrel, Quarrel who shall be
Most honest men; leave me, and then consider
Of what I have said.

I will do any thing,
Rather than lose your Worships grace and favor.

Begone.

Sir, why do you walk alone, and Melancholy?
I have observed you droop much on the sudden.

Dear Isabella, the most solid joy
And comfort of my fading life! thou truest Image
Of thy dead Mother! who excell^d her Sex:
Fair, and not proud on it; witty, and not vain;
Not grave, but Wise; Chaste, and yet kind and free;
Devout, not sower; Religious, not precise:
In her no foolish affectation was
Which makes us na^seate all good qualities.
She was all meekness and humility;
The tenderest Mother, and the softest Wife.

My Dearest and most Honored Father,
(Had you not been the best of Parents living)
I could not have outlived that Mothers loss:
Loss of her tender care, and great example.

Yet learn, my Child, never to grieve for that
Which cannot be recalled; those whom I love
With tenderness I will embrace, when living,
And when they are dead strive to forget 'em soon.

What is it can afflict you now, dear Father?

You Are wise, to thee I can declare my grief;
Thy Brother has been still my tender care,
Out of my duty, rather than affection,
Whom I could never bend by education
To any generous purpose, who delights
In Dogs and Horses, Peasants, Ale and Sloth.

He may have Children will be wiser, Sir.
And you are young enough yet to expect
Many years comfort in your Grandchildren.

To that end, I would match the unhewn Clown
To the fair Daughter of Sir Ieffery Shaklehead,
Who has all the perfections can be wished
In wom^n-kind, and might restore the breed:
But he neglects her to enjoy his Clowns,
His foolish sports, and is averse to Marriage.
I would not have my name perish in him.



But thou art good, my Child, obedient,
And though Sir Timothy, Sir Ieffery's Son,
Has not the great accomplishments I wish him,
His temper yet is flexible and kind,
And will be apt to yield to thy discretion.
His person not ungratious, his Estate
Large, and lies altogether about his House,
Which (for its situation and its building)
With noble Gardens, Fountains, and a River
Running quite through his Park and Garden,
Exceeds most in the North: Thou know my Child
How this cross match will strengthen and advance
My Family -- He is coming hither from
His sport, He has given his Horse to his man, and now*
Is walking toward us; I Will go and find
My Lady and her Daughter.

Oh hard fate!
That I must disobey so good a Father:
I to no punishment can be condemned
Like to the Marriage with this foolish Knight.
But by ill usage of him, I will make him,
I^ possible, hate me as I hate him.

Oh my Fair Cousen, I spi^d ye, and that made me give my man my Horse to come
to you


Me? have you any business with me?


Business! yes Faith, I think I have, you know it well enough, but we have had
no sport this afternoon, and therefore I made have to come to you


Such as you should have no sport made to you, you should make it for others.


Ay, its no matter for that; but Cousen, would you believe it, we were all
(...), Mother Demdike and all her Imps were abroad, I think, but you are the
pr^tty (...) that enchants my heart. This must n^^ds please her


Well said, Academy of Compliments, you are well read I see.


Ods Bud, who would have thought she had read that!


Nay, for Learning and good breeding let Tim alone.


Tim! I might be Sir Timothy in your mouth though one would think.


I am sorry the King bestowed Honor so cheaply.


Nay, not so cheap neither; for though my Lady Mother had a dear Friend at
Court, yet I was fain to give one a Hundred pounds, besides my Fees, I am sure
of that: Tim, hum go too --


Was there ever so fulsom a Fool*


Besides, I gave Thirty Guinnies for the Sword I was Knighted with to one of
his Nobles, for the King di^ not draw his own Sword upon me


Do you abuse the Nobility? would a Nobleman sell you a Sword?


Yes that they will, s^ll that or any thing else at Court. I am sure he was a
great Courtier he talked so prettily to the Kings Dogs, and was so familiar
with them, and they were very kind to (...), and he had great interest in them:
He had all their names as quick, and (...) know who, and discours^d with them,
I protest and vow, as if they had (...) Christians


Oh thou art a pretty F^llow; hey for little Tim of Lancashire.


You might give one on^s title one would think, I say again, especially one
that loves you too


Yes, I will give you your Title.


Thank you dear Co^z^n.


Take that, and your proper Title, Fool.


Fool! I (...) you, I s^orn your words, it is a burning shame you should be
(...), that it is: Little think my ^ady Mother how I am used


Once for all, as a Kinsman I w^ll b^ civil to you; but if you dare make love
(...), I Will make thee such an example, thou shall be a terror to all foolish
Knights


^oolish! ha, ha, ha, that is a pretty jest; why have NOT I been at Oxford and the
(...) of Court? I have spent my time well indeed if I be a Fool still: But I am
not such a Fool to give you over for all this


Do thou hear? thou most incorrigible lump, never to be lickt into form; thou
Coxcomb incarnate; thou fresh, insipid, witless, mannerless Knight, who wearest
a Knighthood worse than a Haberdasher of Small wares would; It serves but to
make thy folly more eminent


Well, well, forsooth, somebody shall know this.


Every one that knows thee knows it. Do thou think, because thy foolish
Mother has Cocker^d thee with morning Cawdles and afternoons Luncheons, thou
art fit to make Love? I Will use thee like a Dog if thou dare but speak once
more of Love, or name the world before me


Mum, mum, no more to be said, I shall be heard some-where. Will your Father
maintain you in these things, ha Gentlewoman


Tell if thou durst, I Will make thee tremble. Heart, if you bent gone now
presently, I Will beat you


My Dear, art thou come! I have been just now tormented by thy foolish Brothers
awkward Courtship, forgive me that I make so bold with him


Prithee do, my Dear, I shall be as free with thine, though he is not so great
a Plague, for he is bashful, very indifferent, and for ought I perceive, to my
great comfort, no Lover at all: But mine is pert, foolish, confident, and on my
Conscience in love to boot


Well, we are resolved never to Marry where we are designed, that^s certain.
For my part I am a free English woman, and will stand up for* my Liberty, and
Property of Choice


And Faith, Girl, I Will be a mutineer on thy side; I hate the imposition of a
Husband, it is as bad as Pop^ry


We will be Husband and Wife to one another, dear Theodosia.


But there are a brace of Sparks we saw at the Spaw, I am apt to believe would
forbid the Banes if they were here


Bellfort and D^ubt^ they write us word they will be here suddenly, but I have
little hopes; for my Father is so resolved in whatever he proposes, I must
despair of his consent for Bellfort, though he is too reasonable to force me to
Marry any one* besides he is engaged, in honor, to your Father


Nay, if thou think of subjection still, or I either, we are in a desperate
case: No, mutiny, mutiny, I say


And no money, no money will our Fathers say.


If our Lovers will not take us upon those Terms they are not worthy of us. If
they will, farewell Daddy, say I


If so, I will be as hearty a Rebel, and as brisk as thou art for thy life; But
can thou think they are such Romancy Knights to take Ladies with nothing? I
am scarce so vain though I am a woman


I would not live without vanity for the Earth; if every one could see their
own faults 'twould be a sad World


Thou say right, sure the world would be almost depopulated, most men ^ould
hang themselves


Ay, and women too: Is there any creature so happy as your affected Lady? or
(...) Coxcomb


I must confess they have a happy error, that serves their turn better than
truth; but away with Philosophy, and let us walk on and consider of the more
weighty matters of our Love


Come along my Dear.


What a pox is the matter? She has pissed upon a Nettle to day, or else the
Witch^s have b^witched her. Hah, now I talk of Witches, I am plag^eily afraid,
and all alone: No here is Nun^^e Tomas


How now Cousen?


Cousen? plain Cousen? You might have more manners Uncle, S flesh, and one
gives you an Inch, you will take an Ell. I see Familiarity breeds Contempt


Well, Sir Timothy, then, Byr Lady I thought no harm; But I am your (...) that.


Yes, my Father's younger Brother. What a Murrain do we keep you for, but to
have an eye over our Dogs and Hawks, to drink Ale with the Tennants (when they
come with R^nt or ^resents) in Black Jacks, at the upper end of a Brown
Sho^^^-board ^able in the Hal^? to sit at lower end oth' board at meals, rise
make ^our (...), and take away your Plate at second Course? And you to be thus
familiar


Pray forgive me good Cousen: Sir Timothy, I mean.


V^ry well, you will be fa^cy again Uncle. Uds lud, Why was I Knighted but to
have my Title given me? My Father, and Lady Mother can give it me, and s^^h a
Fellow as you, a mere younger Brother to forget it


Nay, nay, hand ye yeou mun tat in good part, I did but forget a bit, good Sir
Timo^hy


My Mother would (...) a fine taking about it, and she knew it.


Nay, pray now do not (...) my ^ady, by the Mass who will be even (...) wood an
who hears o^t. But look a, look a, here come the Caursers, the Har^ (...) played
the D^^l with us to (...), we (...) bewitched


Ay, so we have, to have the Hare vanish in open Field before all our fa^^^,
and our eyes never (...) from her


Ay, and then an awd wife (they caw'n her Mother Demdike) to start (...) very
spot o grawnt where we losten puss


These are Prodigies you tell, they cannot be; your senses are deceived.


My senses deceived! that is well, Is there a Justice in Lancashire has so much
skill in Witches as I have? Nay, I Will speak a proud word, you shall turn me
loose against any Witch-finder in Europe; I Would make an Ass of Hopkins if he were
alive


Nay, I Will swear it is true, a Pox on that awd Carrion Mother Demdike, she has
marr^d all our sports, and almost killed Two Brace of Greyhounds worth a
Thousand pound


Dreams, mere Dreams of Witches, old women's fables, the Devil's not such a Fool
as you would make him


Dreams! mercy upon me! are you so profane to deny Witches?


Heaven defend! will you deny the existence of Witches? It Is very Atheistical.


Incorrigible ignorance! it is such as you are Atheistical, that would equal the
Devils power with that of Heaven its self. I see such simple Parsons cannot
endure to hear the Devil dishonored


No Witches? why I have hanged above Fourscore. Read Bodin, Remigius, Delrio,
Nider, Instit^r, Sprenger, Godelman, and More, and Malleus Maleficarum, a great
Author, that Writes sweetly about Witches, very sweetly


Malleus Maleficarum a Writer, he has read nothing but the titles I see.


Oh I a great man, Malleus was a great man; Read Cousen, read the Antidote
against Atheism: Well, I Will make work among your Witches


Ay good Sir Ieffery do, Uds Lud they will grow so bold one shan^ go a Caursing,
Hunting or Hawking for 'em one of these days; and then all the joy of ones
life's gone


Why are those all the joys of Life?


Ay Godsflesh are they, I Would not give a Farthing to live with out 'em, what is a
Gentleman but his Sports


Nay, byr Lady, I mun have a saup of Ale now and then, besides sports.


Why here is my Son, Sir Timothy, saw the Hare vanish, and the Witch appear.


That I did upon my Honor Sir Ieffery.


So ho, here is the Hare again.


He Boys, loo on the Dogs, more sport, more sport.


It Is almost dark, let us home: go to your Mistress, Fool.


Time enough for that, Sir, I must have this Course first, halloo.


Now, Sir Edward, do you see, the Hare is vanished, and here is the Hag.


Yes, I see it is almost dark, the Hare is run from your tired Dogs, and here is
a poor old Woman gathering of sticks


Avaunt thou filthy Hag, I defy thee and all thy works.


This is wheint indeed Sir, you are a Schollard, pray defend me.


Now you shall see how the Witches fear me.


The old women ha^^ reason to fear you, you have hanged so many of 'em.


Now Tom Shaklehead, and you Clod, lay hold of the Witch quickly; now you shall
see my skill, we will search her, I warrant she has biggs or ^eats a handful long
about her parts that shall be nam^less; then we^l have her wa^c^ed e^ght and
forty hours, and pricked with Needles, to keep her from sleeping, and make her
(...), Gad ^hee'l confess any thing in the world then; and if nor, after all,
wee^l tie her Thumbs and great Toes together and (...) her into your great
Pond. Let me alone with her, I warrant ye, come, come, come, where are you


So I must have a poor old woman murdered in my House.


Oh the Witch, the Devil.


How now, what is the matter?


Why by'r Lady, the De^ls in the matter, the old Hag has knocked us both dawn, and
is vanished under grawnt I think


Your fear has knocked you down, and the old woman has escaped.


No, no, she has done't; a Witch has a mighty strength: Six men are not strong
enough for a Witch of Fourscore


Come prethy, Sir Ieffery, let us home and drive these fables out of her heads,
its dark


Nay, I know how to deal with her, I^le send my Warrant, and a Constable with
that is strong enough to beat six Witches, ay, six the ablest Witches on 'em
all^you'd wonder at it, but faith it is true


Ha, ha, ha, how I have fooled these fellows, let 'em go home and prate about
it, this night we will revel in Sir Edward's Celler, and laugh at the Justice.
But to the business of the Night

Come, Sisters, come, why do you stay?
Our business will not brook delay,

From Lakes and Bogs the Toads do croak.
The Foxes bark, the Screetch-Owl screams:
Wolves howl, Bats fly, and the faint beams
O^ Glowworms light grows bright a-pace;
The Stars are fled, the Moon hides her face.




Of Wax and Wool, which we must
With Needles urging to the quick*

Of Black Lambs blood, to make all good.
The Lamb with Nails and Teeth wee^l tear.
Come where is the Sacrifice? appear.

^Tis here.

Why are you all so tardy grown?
Must I the work perform alone?



Come then to work, anon we will play.
To yonder Hall
Our Lord Weel call,
Sing, dance and eat,
Play many a feat,
And fright the Justice and the Squire,
And plunge the Cattle into the Mire.
But now to work

Upon the Waves go sport and play*
And see the ship be Cast away.
Come let us now our parts perform,
And Scrape a hole, and raise a Storm.


Which thus into the Air I Throw.

Here Is sage, that under ground was rotten,
Which thus a-round me I bestow.

Sticks on the Bank across are laid.

The hole by our nails is almost made.
Hogs Bristles boil within the Pot.

The Hollow flint Stone I have Got,
Which I over my Shoulder throw,
Into the west, to make winds blow.
Now water here, and urine put,
And with your Sti^ks stir it about.
Now dip your brooms, and toss them high,
To bring the Rain down from the Sky.
Not yet a Storm?
The Air with every dreadful sound,
And with live vipers beat the ground.

NOw the winds roar*
And the Skies Pour
Down all their Store.
And now the Nights black,
Hark how the Clouds crack.
Hark how the Clouds crack.
A hollow din the Woods now make,
The Valleys tremble, Mountains Shake,
And all the living Creatures quake.
It keeps awake the Sleepy fowl,
The Sailors Swear, the high Seas roll,
And all the frighted Dogs do howl.
Now to our tasks let us all be gone,
Our Master we shall meet anon,
Between the hours of twelve and one.

Whaw, what a Storm is this! I think Mother Demdike and all her Dee'ls are
abroad to neeght, it is so dark to

I canno see my hont.

help! help! this is Mother
Demdike, help, S-lesh,
what m^n I do? I canno
get dawn, 'swawnds Ayst
be clemd an I stay here aw neeght.

Was there ever such a Storm raised on a sudden, the Sky being clear, and no
appearance on it before


But the worst part of our misfortune is to be out of our way in a strange
Country, the night so dark that Owls and Bats are wildred


There is is no help, Cover the Saddles, and stand with the Horses under that
Tree, while we stand close and shelter our selves here; the Tempest is so
violent it cannot last


Now Philosophy help us to a little patience, Heaven be praised we are not at
Sea yet


These troubles we Knight Errants must endure when we march in search of Ladies.


Would we were in as good Lodging as our Dogs have which we sent before to
Whalley. I fear too (after all this device of yours) our pretending to hunt
here will never take


Why So?


Will any body think that a man in his right wits should choose this Hilly
Country to hunt in


O* yes, there are Huntsmen that think there is no sport without venturing Necks
or Collet-bones; besides, there is no other way to hope to see our Mistresses:
by this means we shall troll out my Mistresses Brother, who loves, and
understands nothing but Country sports. By that we may get acquaintance with
Sir Edward Harfourt, who is reported to be a wise, honest, hospitable, true
English man. And that will bring us into Sir Ieffery Shaklehead's family,
Whally being in the midway betwixt them


I am resolved to see my Mistress, what ere comes on^t, and know my doom. Your
Yorkshire Spaw was a fatal place to me, I lost a heart there, Heaven knows when
I shall find it again


Those interviews have spoiled me for a man of this World, I can no more throw
of my loose corns of Love upon a Tennants Daughter in the Country, or think of
Cuckolding a Keeping Fool in the City; I am grown as pitiful a (...) Loving
animal as any Romance can furnish us with


That we should escape in all the Tour of France and Italy, where the (...) has
power to ripen Love, and catch this distemper in the North! but my Theodosia in
humor, wit and beauty has no equal


Besides, my Isabella!


To you your Isabella's equal.


We are pretty fellows to talk of Love, we shall be wet to the Skin; yond^r are
lights in many Rooms, it must be a great House, let us make toward it


It is so dark, and among these Hills and Enclosures it is impossible. Will no
lucky fellow, of this place, come by and guide us? We are out of all Roads


Oh! Oh! what mun Ay do? Ay am well neegh parisht: I mun try to get dawn. Help,
help, Murder, Murder


What a Devil ^s here a fellow fallen from the top of a Tree?


Sdeath ^s tais a night to climb in? what does this mean?


Oh! Oh!


Here, who art thou? What Is the matter?


Oh the Dee^l; avaunt, I defy thee and all thy warks.


Is he drunk or mad? give me thy hand, I Will help thee.


Begone, Witches I defy ye, help! help.


What do thou talk of? we are no Witches nor Devils, but travelers that have
lost our way, and will reward thee well if thou will guide us into it


An yeow been a mon Ay'st talk wy ye a bir, yeow mun tack a care o your ^^lls,

Prithee don't tell us what we should have done, but how far it is to Whalisl^y.


Why marry four mail and a bit.


We Will give thee an Angel and show us the way thither.


Marry that's Whaint I conno see my hont, haw con Ay show yeou to Whalley to

Can thou show us to any house where we may have Shelter and Lodging to

Come on, I am e^n breed aut o my senses, I was never so freeghtend sin I was
born, give me your hont


No here are our men and Horses, we will get up, and you shall lead the foremost:
Now Stars be kind


HOW this insolence provokes me!
You are not sure in earnest!

Can any one behold those radiant eyes
And not have sentiments of Love like mine?

This fellow has read Romances as well as Scholmen*

Those eyes to which mine are the Burning-glasses
That to my heart convey the fire of Love.

What a ^ustian Fool's this! Is this language
For a Divine?

Are not Divines made of those Elements
Which make up other men: Divines may be
In love I hope.

And may they make love to the Daughter without
The consent of the Father?

Undoubtedly, as Casuists must determine.

Will not common sense, without a Casuist, tell
Us when we do wrong, if so, the Law we are
Bound to is not plan enough.

Submit to the judgment of Divines (sweet Lady)
Marriage is not an Ordinance made by Parents,
B^t from above derived* and it is for that I sue.

Is it not fit I should obey my Father?

O no, sweet Lady, ^^ve it not to him,
Your Father has not reverence enough
For the Church and Churchmen,
Besides, I Will tell you,
He is Atheistically inclined: pardon my boldness*
For he believes no Witches: But, Madam, if my
Poor person and my parts may seem gracious to you,
You lawfully may choose me to make happy.

Your person needs must please; ^Tis amiable.

Ah sweet Madam!

Your parts beyond exception, ^eat, spruce, florid,
And very ^^verting.

No, no, dear Madam.

Who can behold your face without pleasure? or
Consider your parts without Reverence?

O Lord, I swear you pose me with your great civilities: I profess you do.


It Is impossible you should keep long from being Dignified.


It Is that I m^inly aim at next the enjoyment
Of so fine a Lady.

May I ^latter my self to think you are in earnest?

You may most excellent Lady.

And so am I.

Sweet Madam, I receive you as a blessing on my knees.

Thou most insolent of Pedants, thou silly formal Thing with a stiff plain
band, a little parsonical Grogram and a Girdle thou art so proud of, in which
thou would do well to hang thy self; some have vouchsafed to use it to that
purpose: Thou that never were but a Curate, -- a Iourney-man Divine, as thy
Father was a Iourney-man Tailor, before he could set up for himself, to have
the impudence to pretend love to me


My function yet, I say, deserves more reverence.


Does it make you not an Ass, or not a Tailors Son?


It equals me with the best of Gentry.


How Arrogance! Can any power give honor but the Kings? This is Popery, I^e
have you trounc'd. Could it once enter into thy vain pate, that I could be
contented with the pitiful equipage of a Parsons Wife? Bless me^ to be carried
home to an antique building, with narrow windows, and huge Iron-bars, like an
old Iail in some Country Borough, wickedly abused too with delapidations. To
lie in Darneux Curtains, and a Beds-Tester, carved with Idolatrous Images, out
of two load of old Timber: or to have for a Friend or a Lying in, one better,
one of worsted Chamblet, and to be dressed and undrest by my Cookmaid, who is my
Woman and my Chambermaid, and serves me and the Hogs


I intend none of these. I assure you my House shall be --


I know what it will be: your Parlour hung with Green printed stuff, of the new
fashion, with guilt Leather in panes, a fingers breadth at least, sruft up with
a great many stinking Russia Leather Chairs, and an odious Carpet of the same:
Then Shelves on one side of your Chimney for a pair of Tables, A Chess-board,
your frame of Wax Candle and Tobacco-pipes


No, no, no, Madam.


On the other side, Shelves for huge Folices, by which you would be counted a
great read man; vast large volumes of expositions upon a short Creed; some
Twenty folio's upon the Ten Commandments; Lauds, Heylins, Andrews, and Tom
Fullers works, with perhaps a piece of Austin, to show you understand a little
Latin; and this is your Ecclesiastical furniture, very fit for a Gentlewoman's
eating room is it not


I understand the mode, Madam, and contemn such vulgar Ornaments.


And in this Parlour to eat Five Tithe-Piggs in a week, brought in by my
Woman-Chambermaid, Wash-maid, Cook-maid, etc. And if it be not a working day,
waited on by your Groom, Ploughman, Carter, Butler, Tithe-gatherer all in one,
with Horse-naild Shoes; his head new kemb^d and slick'd, with a starc'd-Band
and no Cuffs


My merits will provide you better, please to bear me.


Yes, I know your merits. Then to quible with you, for my desert, your
Backside of half an Acre, with some Sixteen Trees of Marygold and
Sweeting-Apples, Horse-Plums, and Warden-pares, hem^d in with panes of antique
crumbling Clay; where I should have six Hives of Bees, and you a Mare and Feal,
going with a Peacock and Hen


All these I much despise would you hea^.


Hear, yes, how I should have nothing to entertain my Visitors with, but stewed
Prunes and H^nycombs, and flying Ale bottled with Lymen-pill, without all sight
of Wine. And should I march abroad to visit, ^would be behind my Can^nical
Husband, perhaps upon a pied ^^ld Mare big with Foal, holding both hands upon
his Girdle, and when at place appointed I arrive, for want of Groom, off slips
my nimble Husband first, then helps me down. And now, Fo^l, I have painted
thee, and what thou art to trust to, in thy colors


I beseech you, Madam, moderate your passions: Hear my propositions.


No, Impudence, my Father shall hear 'em.


I beseech you, Madam, for Heavens sake, that will undo me. I shall desist, I
shall desist

Good lack how a man may be mistaken!
I durst ha sworn, by her courtesy and frequent smiles, she had been in love
with me

Sweet Sir, what is befallen you? has my Lady angered you? If she can, her
heart is not like mine


Nothing, Mrs. Susan, nothing, but to be thus dispis'd.


Dear Sir, can I serve you in any thing? I am bound. I never have been so
elevated by any man; methinks I never should have enough of your powerful
Mi^istry sweet Sir


Pish: If she tells her Father I am ruined.


Dear man, now, come drive away this sadness.
Come, give me thy hand; let us sit down and be merry.

How! my hand! go too.
This creature is in Love with me: But shall my prodigious natural parts, and
no less amazing acquisitions in Metaphysics and Schooled Divinity be cast upon
a Chambermaid? Farewell, I must not be too familiar


So scornful! Cruel creature, I will soften thee yet. Have I for thee set days
and nights cross-Legg'd and sighed before thou came hither? And fasted on St.
Agnes night for thee? And since thy coming have tied three coulour'd True Loves
Knots, quill'd thy Cuffs and startch^d thy Band my self, and never failed thee
of thy morning Ca^dle or Jelly Broth? have I already put my Hair and Nails in
Powder in thy Drink, and put a live Fish in a part about me till it died, and
then gave it thee to eat in thy Drink, and all for this? Well, I will mollify
thee. And Mother Demdike shall help me to morrow: I^le to her, and discourse
her about it. If I have breath, I cannot live without him


Susan, Go tell my Cousin Theodosia, I would speak with her.


I will Sir.


Pshaw, now must I be troubled with making Love; a deuce take it for me: I had
rather be a Coursing an twere time o^th day


Now Son, for your own good and my satisfaction, I would have you (since her
Father and I am agreed) to settle this business, and marry with Theodosia with
all the speed that can be


What haste Sir? For my part I care not for Marriage, not I. I love my
Neighbors, a Cup of Ale, and my sports, I care for naught else


(But that thy Mother was too virtuous for my suspicion) I should think that by
thy ^ordid mind thou were a Stranger to my Blood; and, if you be not ruled by
me, assure your self I Will make you a stranger to my Estate


What does he mean now? hah, to disinherit me?


No, part of its entail^d; and if you will not marry where I direct you, your
Sister will obey me, and may bring me one to inherit it. Consider that

Here comes your Mistress, beautiful and good as any of her Sex. Sweet Cousin
be pleased to stay one moment with my Son: I^le wait on you again


Your Servant Sir. How shall I be entertained by this Dolt! How much rather had
he be with Country Justices and Farmers, in a low Thatched House, with a smooth
Black Pot of Ale in his hand, or with his Kites, Dogs and Cattle


What a Devil shall I say to her now? I had as leive knock my head against the
wall as make Love. Will you please to sit down Cousin


Ay Cousin. And fall fast a-sleep if I can.


'Twas a great Storm, and rose very suddenly to night Cousin.


Very true.


Pox, I don't know what to say to her.
It Is almost over though now.

'^is so.


It Is so, What a Devil shall I say more? Would I were at six go downs upon
reputation, in Ale, with honest Tom Shaklehead

What do you think it is a Clock Madam?

Six minutes past eight by mine.


Mine goes faster, Is yours Aspenwolds?


No Tompions.


It Is a very pretty one! Pish, I can go no farther, not I.


It Is Bedtime.


Ay so it is, and I am main sleepy byr Lady,
Coursing had gotten me a woundy Stomach,
And I eat like a Swine Faith and Troth.

But it got you nothing to your Stomach.


You have heard the story, we cours'd a Witch all day instead of a Hair; Mother
Demdike


It Is well you did not catch her, she would have been very tough meat.


Ha, ha, ha, well I ^ow that^s very well. I hope Sir Ieffery will hang the
Wit^h; I am sure she has tired my Dogs and me so, that I am so sleepy I can
scarce hold up my head by^r Lady


I am tired too: This dullness is almost as tedious as his making of Love would
be


If 'twould hold up now, we should have fine weather for Hawking to morrow, and
then have at the Powts


Your Hawks would not fly at Mother Demdike too.


Nay, marry I cannot tell: But would you would go a Hawking, you should ride
upon a Pad of mine, should carry you with a Bumper in your hand, and not spill
a drop


I am for no Field sports I thank you Sir.


Now cannot I speak a word more.


Now methinks we are mere man and Wife already, without marrying for the
matter. Hah, he is a-sleep, and snores like the Base-pipe of an Organ: Though I
like his indifference better than I should his Love; yet I have no patience to
bear sleeping in my face; that is a little too much


Oh Lord, what is that! Oh Mother Demdike! Oh, oh, the Witch, the Witch!


He talks in his sleep, I believe, even as well, as when he is awake.


Murder, murder, oh help, the Witch; oh the Witch, oh, oh, Mother Demdike!


He talks and dreams of the Witch: I Will try a trick with him.


Oh help, help, the Witch, the Witch, ay there she vanished: I saw her, oh she
flew up the Chimney. I Will go to Sir Ieffery, and take my Oath presently. Oh I
am fore frightened

Oh the Witch, the Witch, Mother Demdike.

What ails the Fool, is he mad?
Here Is a Coil with Witches.

Oh Madam, are you there? I have done your errant.


Your Servant Cousin.


Your Ladyships humble Servent.


Look you Cousin, Lady me no Ladies, unless you be civiller to Sir Timothy.


Look you there.


I suppose you are not ignorant who we are.


Nay, prithee, Sir Ieffery, hold; Let me alone.


Nay, go on my Dear, thou shall have it; well, thou art as notable a woman as
any is within Fifty miles of thy head, I^le say that for thee


Pray Cousin conceive me, breeding is a fine thing; but you have always lived
in the Country* I have, for my part, been often at London, lodged in
Covent Garden ay, and been in the drawing Room too. Poor creature, she does not
know what that is


Pray mind my Chicken, she is the best bred Woman in the Country.


Pray spare me Sir Ieffery, here is Sir Timothy, I have bred him with great care
and charges at Oxford and the Inns of Court


Ay, and I have been in the Drawing Room too.


I have gotten him Knighted too, for mine and Sir Iefferies services, which we
have performed in governing the Country about us so well


What does your Ladyship drive at?


Ay, you know well enough: Now you look as if Butter would not melt in your
mouth


Besides, let me tell you, Sir Timothy's person's as charming as another; his
shape and height perfect, his Face, though I say it, exceeding good, his Eyes
vigorous and sparkling his Nose and Chin resembling our Family; in short,
Nature has not been negligent in his Composition


Well, thou art the best spoken Woman in England, I Will say that for thee.


I confess all this Madam.


Oh, do you so.


Pray give me leave, not one Knight in the Land dresses better, or wears better
fancied Garniture, or better P^riwigs


My Triming's my own fancy; and the best Wigg-maker in England, one in
Crooked-lane works for me


Hold Sir Timothy, I say these things premised, it is not ^it to use my Son
uncivilly: I am loath to complain to your Father, consider and be wise. I know
we are politickly coy, that is decent; I, my self, was so to Sir Ieffery


Ay by'r Lady was she. Well, I thought I should never have won thee* Thou were
a parlous Girl


But I was never uncivil.


I know not what you mean! I uncivil to my dear Cousin! what mak^s thee think
so? I assure your Ladyship I value him as he deserves. What Cousin art angry
for a jest? I think no man like him for my part


Why, look you Sir Timothy.


Nay Sir Timothy, you are to blame, jesting shows ones kindness, go too.


I swear and vow I thought you had been in earnest Cousin. I am your humble
Servant


Well, we will leave you together.


Come on Boy, stand up to her, Gad I bore up briskly to thy Mother before I won
her. Ah, when I was young, I would have -- Well, no more to be ^^id


Come, come away, you will have your saying!


Well, but have you so good an opinion of me as you declar^d? hum --


The very same I assure you.


Ah my dear pretty Rogue! Then I^le marry you presently, and make you a La^y.


Let me see, are they out of hearing?


Come f^th, let us kiss upon that business, here is a Parson in the House; nay,
feth, feth, I must kiss thee, my dear little Rogue


Stand off Baboon, nay, a Baboon of good parts Exceeds thee; Thou Magg^t,
Insect, worse then any nasty thing the Sun is Father to


What do you begin to call names again? but this is in Jest too prithee, ^et me
Kiss thee, pray dear, feth do


In ^est! Heaven is my witness there is not a living thing upon Two Legs I would
not choose before Thee


Holloo, Where Is Sir Ieffery and my Lady?


They are out of thy hearing Oaph. 'Slife how dare thou be so Impudent to love
me with that face, that can provoke nothing but laughter at best in any one?
Why thou ha^t the Rickets in thy fa^^: There^s no proportion, every feature by
it self is abominable; and put togeth^r I^tollerable. Thou have the very Lines
and air of a Piggs face, Baptista Porta would have drawn thee so


Hah, What do you say? my face! I Will not change with e're a man in Lancashire.
Face! talk of my face, Hah


Thou art uglier than any Witch in Lancashire, and if thou were in Woman's
Clothes, thy own Father would apprehend thee for one: Thy Face, I never saw so
deformed a thing on the head of an old Lyra violl. It might fright Birds from a
Cherry garden: But what else it is good for, I know not


'Sbud, now you provoke me, I must tell you, I think my self as hansome for a
Man, as you are for a woman


Oh, foh, out upon that filthy visage, My maid with her Sizars in two minutes
shall Cut me a Better in brown paper. There is not a Creature upon Earth but i^
a Beauty to thee; besides, thou have a hollw Tooth would Cure the Mother beyond
^r^a setida or burnt Feathers


Well, well, You Will sing another note when I have acquainted your Father, you
will


Thou li^^t, I will not* If I were condemnd to Death, I would not take a pardon
(...) marry thee. Set thy Fools heart at rest then, and make no more nauseous
Love to m^. Thy Face to one fasting would give a vomit beyond Crocus


You are a proud, peevish, Mi^x, and that is the best of you. Let me tell you
that, hum. I can have your betters every day I rise


How now! What says the fool?


Uds Ludlikins, huswife, If you provoke me I Will take you of the Pate.


Thou odious, Loathsome Coxcomb, out of my sight, or I Will tear thy Eyes ou^.


Coxcomb! ha, ha, ha, ah thou are a good one. Well I say no more.


Da, da, pretty thing!


Gentlemen, the storm has obliged me that drove you under my Roof, I knew your
Fathers well, we were in Italy together, and all of us came home with our
English Religion, and our English Principles. During your stay here (which for
my own sake I hope will not be short) command my House: let not your Dogs and
Servants lie at Whalley; but be pleased to know this House is yours, and you
will do me honor in commanding it


This generosity makes good the Character that all men give of you.


A Character that England rings with, and all men of never so differing
opinions agree in


Gentlemen, you do me too much honor; I would endeavor to imitate the life of
our English Gentry before we were corrupted with the base manners of the Fren^h


If all had had that Noble resolution, long since we had curbed the greatness
of that Monarch


What are these Apparitions, Doubty and Bellfort!


They are they indeed. Hay, what ails my heart to beat so fast?


Methinks mine is a little too busy here.


Gentlemen, here is my Daughter and her Kinswoman, I think you saw 'em last
Summer at Scarbrough


We did Sir.


We little thought to have the honor of seeing so fine Ladies this night.


We could not expect this happiness, till next Season at the Waters.


What story is this? My Son almost frighted out of his wits with a Witch!
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for a moment


Your humble Servant.


Nothing could be more unexpected than seeing you here!


Pray Gentlemen, How did you come?


Traveling for Whalley, where I told you, Madam, in my Letters, I would
suddenly be, we lost our way by the darkness of the night, and wander^d till
we came near this House, whither an honest Co^ntry fellow brought us for
shelter from this dreadful Tempest


And your Father is pleased to admit a brace of stray-fellows with the greatest
civility in the world: But, Madam, coming safe to shore, after a Shipwreck,
could not bring such joy to me, as I find in seeing you


The Sun, to a man left a Winter at Greenland, could not be so ravishing a
sight, as you dear Madam are to me


This is Knight Errantry indeed.


Methinks they talk Romance too. But it is too late if they be in earnest; for
the Dames are disposed of


How, Married!


Not executed but condemned!


Beyond all hopes of mercy.


Death, Madam, you struck me to the heart: I felt your Words here.


My heart was just at my mouth, if you had not stopped it with this Cordial 'thad
slown. I may live now in hope of a reprieve for you


Our Fathers will never consent to that.


Mine will not I am sure. I have a Mother, to boot, more obstinate than he.


If they be so merciless, self-preservation, the great Law of Nature will
justify your escape


We Knight Errants, as you call us* will rescue you I^ warrant you.


But if we leave our fools, our Fathers will leave us.


If you lose your Father, Madam, you shall find one that will value you
in^initely more, and love you more tenderly


And you, Madam, shall meet with one, whose person and whose fortune shall be
always at your command


We grow a little too serious about this matter.


It Is from Matrimony we would fly! oh it is a dreadful thing.


This heresy can never be defended by you: a man must be blind that inclines to
that opinion before you


Gentlemen, I ask your pardon, be pleased to walk into the next Room, and take
a small Collation to refresh your selves


Your Humble Servant.


This Country Fellow that led you hither, tells me a Tale of Witches, and
here is and uproar in my Family, and they say this place is haunted with them; I
hope you have no faith in those things


When I hear a very strange story, I always think it is more likely he should
lie that tells it me, than that should be true


It Is a good rule for our belief.


My blood rises at them, These are damned Hobbists and Atheists, I Would have 'em
burn^ in Smithfield


Well, these Gentlemen may perhaps go to their Servants and Horses at Whall^y
to morrow, where they must stay some time before we see 'em again


We are ruined then: For this Marriage will be so pressed upon us, now the
Writings are sealed, and Clothes bought, we shall have no way to delay it, but
downright breaking with our Fathers


I am resolv^d to consult with the Gentlemen this night whatever comes on it.


How can thou possibly bring it about my Dear?


I warrant thee, a Woman's wit will naturally work about these matters. Come my
Dear


Lo here our little
Let each of us
See our provisions ready here,
To which no

Who draws the Wine?

Our
Go thou.

And thou.

And thou.

And thou.


Relate the service of the night.

To a Mothers Bed I softly crept,
And while the unchristen'd Brat yet slept,

And stole another flesh and fat,
Which I will boil before it stink;
The thick for Ointment, then for Drink
I^le keep --

I bit dryd Sinews and shrunk Veins.
Marrow and Entrails I have Brought,
A piece ot'h' Gibbet too I got,
And of the Rope the fatal Knot.
I sunk a Ship, and in my flight
I kicked a Steeple down to Night.

Well done my Dame, Ho, ho, ho, ho.


To Charnel houses and to Graves.

From dead men's Eyes the glewy^Stuff,
Their Eye Balls with my nails scoop'd out
And pieces of their Limbs I Have brought --

The Fathers neck I Twisted too.
Doggs-barkt, Cocks-Crowed, away I flew.

A good Servant, Ho, ho, ho.


I snatched, and more from a ravenous Bitch.



And the blood of murdered men,

A Serpents Bowels, Adders Ears,
I put in my Pou^ch; and coming back
The Bells in a Steeple I did crack.
I sent the murren into Hogs,
And drove the Kine into the Bogs.

It Is well, it is well. Ho, ho, ho, ho.


A Wolfs Tail, Hair, and Yard, I Have got
The Green Frogs Bones, whose flesh was tain
From thence by Ants; then a Cats Brain,
The Bunch of flesh from a black Foles head,
Just as his Dam was brought to Bed,
Before she li^kt it; and I have some
Of that which falls from a Mares Womb
When she is in Lust; and as I came home
I put a woman into ^its
And ^righted a Parson out of his wits.

All Is well. Ho, ho, ho, ho.

WHat joy like ours can mortals find?
We can command the Sea and Wind:
All Elements our Charms obey,
And all good things become our prey;
The daintiest Meat, and lustiest Wine,
We for our Sabaths still design.
Amongst all the great Princes the sun shall ere see.
None can be so great, or so happy as we.
We Sail in Egg-shells on rough Seas,
And se^ strange (...) when we please*
Or on our Be^soms we can fly,
And nimbly mounting to the Sky,
We leave the swiftest Birds behind,
And when we please outstrip the Wind:
Then we feast and we revel after long ^light,
Or with a Loved Incubus sport all the night.
When we are on Wing, we sport and play,
Mankind, like Emmets, we survey;
With Lightening blast with Thunder Kill.
Cause barrennesss where e're we will.
Of full revenge we have the power;
And Heaven it self can have no more.
Here Is a health to our Master the Prince of the Flies,
Who commands from Center all up to the Skies.



YOu have extremely delighted us this morning, by your House, Gardens, your
Accommodation, and your way of Living, you put me in mind of the renowned
Sidneys Admirable description of Kalandar


Sir you Complement me too much.


Methinks you represent to us the Golden days of Queen Elizabeth, such sure
were our Gentry then; now they are grown Servile Apes to Foreign customs,
they leave off Hospitality, for which we were famous all over Europe, and turn
Servants to Board-wages


For my part, I love to have my Servants part of my Family, the other were to
hire day Laborers to wait on me, I had rather my Friends, Kindred, Tennants
and Servants should live well out of me, than Coach-makers, Tailors,
Embroiderers, and Lacemen should: To be pointed at in the Streets, and have
Fools stare at my Equipage, is a vanity I have always scorned


You speak like one descended from those Noble Ancestors that made France
tremble, and all the rest of Europe Honor 'em


I reverence the Memory of 'em: But our New-fashion'd Gentry love the French
too well to fight against 'em; they are bred abroad without knowing any thing
of our Constitution, and come home tainted with Foppery, slavish Principles,
and Popish Religion


They bring home Arts of Building from hot Countries to serve for our cold one;
and F^^gality from those places where they have little Meat and small Stomachs,
to suffice us who have great plenty and lusty Appetites


They build Houses with Halls in 'em, not so big as former Porches; Beggars
were better entertained by their Ancestors, than their Tennants by them


For my part, I think 'twas never good days, but when great Tables were kept in
large Halls; the Buttery-hatch always open, Black Jacks, and a good smell of
Meat and March-beer, with Dogs-turds, and Mary-bones as Ornaments in the Hall:
These were signs of good House keeping, I hate to see Italian fine Buildings
with no Meat or Drink in 'em


I like not their little Plates, methinks there is Virtue in an English Sur-loyn.


Our Sparks bring nothing but Foreign Vices and Follies home; it is rediculous
to be bred in one Country to learn to live in another


While we lived thus (to borrow a Coxcombly word) we made a better Figure in
the World


You have a mind that suits your Fortune, and can make your own happiness.


The greatest is the Enjoyment of my Friends, and such Worthy ^e^tlemen ^s your
Selves, and when I cannot have enough of that; I have a Library, good Hors^s
and good Music


Princes may envy such an English Gentleman.


You are too kind, I am a true English man, I love the Princes Rights and
P^ples liberties, and will defend 'em both with the last penny in my purse, and
the last drop ^n my veins, and dare defy the witless Plots of Papists


Spoken like a Noble Patriot.


Pardon me, you talk like Englishmen, and you have warmed me; I hope to see
the Prince and People flourish yet; old as I am, inspite of Jesuits, I am sure
our Constitution is the Noblest in the World


Would there were enough such English Gentlemen.


Twere to be wished; but our Gentry are so much poisoned with Foreign V^nities,
that methinks the Genius of England seems sunk into the Yeoma^^y


We have indeed too many rotten Members* You speak like Gentlemen, Worthy of
such Noble Fathers, as you both had; but Gentlemen I spoke of Music, I see two
of my Artists, come into the Garden, they shall entertain you with a Song this
Morning


Sir you oblige us every way.
Finely composed, and excellently performed.

I see Sir you are well served in every thing.


My sweet Cousin good Morrow to thee, I hope to call thee shortly by another
Name, my dear Child, Heaven's bless thee


Ladies your most humble Servant; you are early up to take the pleasure of the
Morning in these Gardens


It Is a Paradise you are in; every object within this place is ravishing.


This place affords variety of Pleasures; nothing here is wanting.


Where such fine Ladies are.


A Gentleman, To speak with you.


With me! Daughter pray show those Gentlemen the Statues, Grottoes and the
Waterworks, I^le wait on you immediately


This is an opportunity beyond our hopes.


Would you speak with me?


Arrah, and please ty Oorship, I am come here to displaash to maake a (...)
unto thee, dest dou not know me Joy


Oh! You live at Mr. Redletters my Catholic Neighbors.


Ah by my Shoul, I.


How came you to venture hither? you are a Popish-Priest.


Ay, but it is no matter for all daat ^oy: by my Shoul, but I will taak de
Oades, and I think I will be excused, but hark (...) you a while, by my trott I
shall be a Pa^pist too for all daat, indeed, yes


Excellent Principles.


I do come for de nonest to see dee, and yet I do not come on purpose gra: But
it is no matter, I will talk vid you about daat, I do come upon occaasion and
Mr. Redletter did shend me unto de^


For What?


What will I say unto dee now, but Mr. Redletter did shend me, and yet I did
come of my self too for all daat upon occaasion, daat I did hear, concerning
of dee, dat die House and de Plaash is all overrun with Witches and Spirits, do
you see now


I had best let this Fool stay to laugh at him, he may be out of the damned
Plot, if any Priest was? Sure they would never trust this Fool


What shaall you shay unto me upon all dis, I will exorcize doze Vitches, and I
will plague dose Devils now by my Shoul, vid Holy Water, and vid Relics, and
I will ^reet 'em out of his Plaash, God shaave the King


I have forgot your Name.


They do put the Name of Kelly upon me, Joy, but by my fait I am called by my
own right Name, Tegue O Devilly


Tegue O Devilly?


Yes, a very oold Naam in Eereland by my Shalvaation, well gra, I have brought
upon my Cloke-bagg shome Holy Water, and I will put it upon the Devils and de
Vitches Faashes, and I will make you shome more Holy Water, and you will vaash
all de Rooms vid it and be --


Well, Father Tegue O Devilly, You're welcome; but how ^are you venture
publicly in these times


Why, I have great consideraation upon die Prudence; for if dou woudst betray
me, now phare will be de soleedity of dat Joy


I speak not for my self, but others.


The Devil ^aak me now, I do think, I will suffer for my Religion, I am afraid
I will be slain at lasht at the plaash they call Saint Ty-burn, but I do not
caare by my Shalvaation; for if I will be hanged, I will be a Saint presently,
and all my Country shall pray unto Saint Tegue, besides, shome great people
will be naamless too, I tell you I shay noe more, but I will be prayed unto Joy


Prayed too! Very well.


Yes by my Shoule will I, and I will have Relics maade of me too.


Sir Ieffery Shacklehead and my Lady have some business with you, and desire
your company within


Come Father Tegue, come along with me, do you hear, find the Gentlemen that
are walking with my Daughter and her Cousen, and tell 'em I will wait on 'em
presently


I will. They are here, Gentlemen, my Master is called away upon business (...)
begs your excuse, and will wait on you presently


Heaven gives us yet a longer Opportunity, and certainly intends we should make
use of it; I have my own Parson that comes to hunt with me at Whally, Madam, an
excellent School Divine, that will end all differences betwixt us


He is like to begin 'em betwixt us* the Name of a Parson is a dreadful Name
upon these occasions, he I bring us into a Condition we can never get out of
but by Death


If the absolute command of me and my Fortune can please you, you shall never
desire to get out of it


I should at more distance and with more reverence approach you, Madam, did not
the shortness of the time, and the great danger of losing you, force me to be
free; Throw not away this precious time, a Minute now is Inestimable


Yet I must consider on that Minute on which the happiness or Misery of all my
Life may depend


How can ^ imagine that you who have rambled up and down the Southern World,
should at last ^ix on a Horne-bred Mistress in the North? how can you be in
earnest


Consult your Understanding and your Looking-Glass, one will tell you how
Witty, Wise, and Good you are, the other, how Beautiful, how Sweet, how
Charming


Men before they are Married turn the great end of their Perspective; but the
little end after it


They are Men of ill Eyes, and worse Understanding; but for your Perfections
there needs no Perspective


If I were inclined to Marriage, methinks we are not well enough acquainted yet
to think of that


To my Reputation I suppose you are no Stranger, nor to my Estate, which li^s
all in the next County; and for my Love, I will convince you of it, by settling
what ever you please, or all that Estate upon you before I expect any Favor
from you


You are so Generous beyond my Deserts, that I know not how to Credit you.


Your Modesty is too Great, and your Faith too Little.


Death, Who are these whith my Mistress and my Sister? Oh! they are the silly
Fellows that we saw at the Spaw, that came hither last night, do you know Sir,
that this is my Mistress Sir


I know Sir that no man is worthy of that Honor.


Ye^ Sir, I will make you know that I am Sir, and She has the Honor to be my
Mi^tress


Very well Sir.


Very well Sir, No it is very ill Sir, that you should have the boldness to take
my Mistress by the Hand Sir, and if you do Sir, I must tell* you Sir -- What do
you Smile Sir


A man may do what he will with his own Face. I may Smile Sir --


If you do Sir, I will fight Sir, I tell you that Sir. hah,


Sir Timothy, you are a Bloody-minded man.


It Is for my Honor, my Honor, he is plaguely afraid; look you Sir, if you
Smile Sir, at me Sir, I will Kick Sir, that is more Sir


If you do, you will be the fifteenth man I have run through the Body Sir.


Hah! What does he say, through the Body, oh.


Yonder Is my Brother, we must not be so particular, lets join.


How, the Body Sir?


Yes Sir, and my custom is (if it be a great affront, I kill them, for) I rip
out their Hearts, dry 'em to Powder, and make Snuff on 'em


Oh Lord! Snuff!


I have a box full in my pocket Sir, will you please to take some.


No Sir, I thank you Sir: Snuff quoth a, I will have nothing to do with such a
cruel man, I say no more Sir


Your Servant Sir --


Your Servant Sir: does he take such Snuff too?


The same -- do you hear Sir, if you value your own life, which I will save for
the Families sakes, not a word of this to any man


No Sir, Not I Sir? Your humble servant.


I ask your pardon Gentlemen, I was stayed by what, if you please to walk in,
will divert you well enough


We will wait on you Sir.


Daughter, Sir Ieffery and my Ladys have made complaints of you for abusing Sir
Timothy; let me hear no more on it, we have resolved the Marriage shall be to
Morrow, it will become you to be upon a little better Terms to day


Do you here that Gentlewoman --


Gentlemen, I have sent to Whally for all your Servants, and Horses, and Dogs,
you Must do me the honor to Make some stay with me


We cannot enough acknowledge your great Civility.


No Complements, I obliege my self; Sir Ieffery Shacklehead and I have just now
agreed, that to morrow shall be the Day of Marriage between our Sons and
Daughters


Very short warning.


He I not delay it longer.


I Will in and see what the reason of this sudden resolution.


Sir we wait on you.


Stay you there a while with Sir Timothy.


Dear Cousin, prithee be kinder to me, I protest and vow, as I am a Christian,
I love the better then both my Eyes, for all this


Why how now Dogs face, have thou the Impudence to make love again, with that
hideous Countenance? that very insipid silly Physnomy of thine? with that most
piteous mein? why thou lookst like an Operat^r for Teeth


This is all sham, I wont believe it; I can see my self in the great glass, and
to my mind no man looks more like a Gentleman than my self


A Gentleman! with that silly wadling shuffling gate? thou have not mien good
enough for a chief Constable, every change of thy Countenance, and every motion
of thy Body proclaims thee an Ass


Ay, Ay, come Madam, I shall please you better when I am Married, with a (...)
that I have; I tell ye


Out of my sight, thou make me sick to see thee.


I shall be more Familiar with you to Morrow-night, oh my dear rogue -- well I
say no more, faith I shall, well, no more to be said


Be gone thou Basilisk, here, I vow if thou were the only man on Earth, the
Kind should cease rather than I would Marry thee


You Will be in a better humor to Morrow-night, though you are such a (...) now.


This place, where some Materials are to mend the Wall, will furnish me with
some Ammunition: be gone I say


I shant do^t, I know when I am in good Company, come prithee Cousin, do not
let us Fool any longer, to Morrow we shall be one flesh -- de ye see


I had rather be inoculated into a Tree, than be made one Flesh with thee; can
that Westph^lia hide of thine ever become one Flesh with me? when, I can become
one Ass with thee it may, you shall never change my mind


Well, well, I shall have your Body to Morrow-night, and I warrant you your
mind shall soon follow it


Be gone, thou infinite Coxcomb, I Will set thee farther.


What, what, what a pox! hold, what a Devil, are you mad? Flesh, heart, hold,
what a plague, uds bud, I could find in my heart to turn again


Do ^ilthy Face, do if thou dare.


Oh help, murder, murder.


I have no patience with this Fool, no Racks, or Tortures shall force me to
marry him


I am very indifferent about this Matrimony, and for ought I see, you are so
too


I must confess you are as fine a Gentlewoman as ever I saw, and I am not
worthy of you; but my Father says he will disinherit me, if I will not marry
you to Morrow; therefore I desire you would please to think on it


I will think on it.


You shall command all my Estate, and do what you will; for my part, I r^solve
all my Life, to give up my self wholly to my Sports, and my Horses, and my
Dogs, and to drink now and then a cup of Ale with my Neighbors, I hate Wine


You will do very well.


He says we must be Married to Morrow at Ten, I can be going a Hawking by six
and come home time enough, I would be loath to neglect my Hawking at Pow^s in
the height of the Season


By no means, you would do very ill if you should.


Ay so I should, but shall I tell my Father that you will have me to Morrow?
you know the Writings are Sealed, and Wedding-Cloaths bought of all sides


Well, I shall do as becomes me.


Well, Cousin there is no more to be said betwixt you and I then, Pa^ce Verba, a
word to the Wise, I say, is enough, so I rest your humble Servant to command;
^e tell my Father what you say presently, your Servant to, tell you truly I had
never so much mind to be Married as now; for I have been so woundedly frightened
with Witches, that I am afraid to lie alone, dee see; well, I am glad this
business is over: a pox upon all m^king of Love for me


I thought I saw my Cousin in yo^ Walk, it is time for us to consult what to do,
my Father and Mother are resolved upon to Morrow for the fatal day


By my shoule, Joy, I thank you for my Fast-break, for it does give refreshment
unto me, and Consolaation too gra


Thank you Mistress Susan, my Caudle was admirable; I am much strengthened by
these good Creatures


Yours was admirable -- if Mother Demdike has any Skill, I shall find the
opperati^^ before night, and I will be revenged for his scorn to me


Though thou dosht know me, yet thou dosht shay thou will tell nothing
concerning of me


No, for my part though I differ in some things, yet I honor the Church of
Rome as a true Church


By my Shalvaation ye did all come out of us indeed, and I have expectaation
daa^ you will come in again, and I think I will live to she it; perhaps I will
tell you now, you had your Ordination too with us


For my part, I think the Papists are honest, loyal men, and the Jesuits dyed
innocent


Phaat dou dosht not believe de Plot de Devil taak me.


No, no, no Papist Plot, but a Presbyterian one.


Aboo, boo, boo, By my Shalvaation I will embraash die Fathers Child, and I will
put a great kish upon die cheek, now for dat, ay dear ish a damnd Presbyterian

Why the true and wise Church of England-men believes it, and are a great Rock
against the Church of Rome


And Preach and Write learnedly against it; but such Fellows as you are
scandals to the Church, a Company of Tantivy Fools


All the Eminent men of the Church of England believe the Plot, and detest it
with horror, and abominate the Religion that contrived it


Not all the Eminent men, for I am of another opinion.


By my shoul, by my Shoud, Joy, dey are our Enemies, and I would have no fait
put upon de^^, but dis is my dear Friend


This is a Rascal concealed in the Church, and is none of it; sure his Patron
know^ him not


No certainly!


You are Hobbists and Athiests.

Your Servant Gentlemen.


Your most humble Servant.


Your most humble Servant.


Is not my Irish man a pleasant fellow?


A great Father of the Church.


And perhaps may come to be hanged for it.


Sir (...) to take some informations about Witches, perhaps that may divert you
not ill, It Is against my opinion, but I give him way


I hope you are pleased to pardon my incivillity, in rushing unawares into your
Chamber last night; but I know you are so much a Gentleman, so well-bred* and
so a^^^mplis^t, I know you do --


^adam.


And for that reason I will make you my Confident in a business, that perhaps,
I do not know, but I think it may not be t^ your disadvantage, I will
communicate it to you in ^^ivate. N^w, Sir Ieffery and I are to take some
Examinations. I assist him very (...) business, or he could never do it


Call in these Fellows, (...) hear what they will say about these Witches; come
on, Did you serve my Warrant on Mother Demdike


Sir, I went to her House (and please your Worship) and looked in at her Window,
and she was feeding three great Toads, and they daunc'd and leapt about her,
and she suckled a great black Cat well nigh as big as a Spaniel; I went into
the House, and she vanished, and there was nothing but the Cat in the middle,
who spit and star'd at me, and I was frighted away


An arch Witch I warrant her.


I went out at the back-dore, and by the Threshold sat a great Hare, I struck
at it, and it run away, and ever since I have had a great pain in my back, and
cannot make Water, saving your presence


A fit of the Gravel.


No, by my shoule, she is a great Witch, and I will cure you upon ^aat.


No: I tell you, Sir Edward, I am sure she is a Witch, and between you and I,
last night, when I would have been kind to my Wife, she bewit^ht me, I found it
so


Those things will happen about ^ive and fifty.


I will tell you now, Joy, I will cure you too. Patrick, and I will shay shome
Ave Maaries for dee, and dou wilt be ^ound again: gra


Who is this pretends to skill in Witchcraft?


A very lea^^ed man in these matters, that comes hither on purpose.


I shall be gla^ of your better acquaintance.


I will be very vel pleash'd to b after being acquainted vid dee Joy.


Have you any more to say? Fellow speak to me.


Why, an't please your Worship forsooth, Mother Demdike said she would be
reveng^d on me for not giving her some Butturmilk; and the next night coming
from Rachdale, I saw a great Black Hog, and my Horse threw me, and I lost a Hog
that night, he died, that was as well when he went to bed, as ever he was since
he was born


It Is enough, a plain, a manifest Witch, make a Warrant for her.


Ay, do.


Take some of the Thatch of her House, and burn it at your House, and you shall
see she will come straight


Or to morrow about dawn, piss in a Pot, and cover it with your right, neither
Stocking, and the Witch will be tormented in her Bladder, and come to you
roaring before night


A most profound Science.


And poor old Ignorant wretches must be hanged for this.


A Cow of mine is bewitched too, and runs about the Close as if she were mad;
and that, I believe, Mother Hargrave bewitched, because I denied her some (...).
-- good


(...) into the Warrant too: It Is enough, a little thing will serve for
evidence against ^ Witch


A very little one.


Irish Trowsers upon your Cows head, Fellow, upon a Friday Morning, and wid a
great Stick maak beat upon her, till she do depart out of de Close, and she
vill repair unto de Witches door, and she vill knock upon it vid her Horns
indeed


Thank you good Sir.


Sir, I see you are a Learned man in this business, and I honor you.


Your Servant Sir, I will put shome holy waater into your Cows mout, and I will
maak Cure upon her for all daat indeed


Come, has any one else any thing to inform?


Yes an^t please your Worship, here is a Neighbor, Thomas o Georges.


Why, an't please your Worships, I was at Mal. Spencers^ House where he wons
(...) Lone, and whoo had a meeghty great Cat, a black one by'r Lady, and whoo
kissed and who clipped Cat, and ay set me d^wn a bit (meet a bit) and believe Cat
went under her Coats, Quo ay what don yeo do with that fow Cat? why, says
Whoo, who soukes me. Soukes tee! Marry that is whaint quo ay, by'r Lady what ^an
Cat do besides? Why, says whoo, whoost carry me to Rachdale believe. Whaw, quo
ay, that is pr^tty! Why, says whoo, ye^st ha one an yeow win to carry yeow;
by'r lady, quo ay, with aw my heart, and thank ow too, marry 'twill save my Tit
a power of labor; so whoo cawd a Cat to me, a huge Cat, and we ridden both to
Rachdale strieght along


Well said, this was home; I love a Fellow that will go through stitch.


This is a Witch, indeed, put her name in.


This is n^w thing by my Shoule, I will tell you now it is naw thing for all
d^at, a Vi^h, if she be a good Vitch, will ride upon a Graashopper, I tell you,
very well, and yet a Graashopper is but a weak beast neither; you do maak
wonder upon dis^ but by my Shoule it is naw thing


Where did you take Cat, say you, together?


Why, we took Cat^ith^ Lone meet a mile off.


So you rid eight mile upon Cats: are there any more informations?


No more an^t please your Worship, but when I have once taken 'em, enough will
come in


Go then about taking 'em, and bring 'em before Sir Ieffery, and my self, Ple
warrant you we will order 'em


I will tell you now Fellow, taak de shoe of a Horse, and nail it upon your
Threshold, de plaash dou dosht go into die door upon


And put a Clove of Garlic into the Roof of thy Horse.


Femel is very good in your House against Spirits and Witches, and Alicium, and
the Herb Mullein, and Long-wort, and Moly too is very good





Thank you good Sir.


Thank a.


Is not this an excellent Art?


It Is so extravagant, that a man would think they were all in Dreams that ever
writ of it


I see no manner of Evidences against these poor Creatures.


I could laugh at the^e Fools sufficiently, but that all the while our
Mistresses are in danger


Our time is very short, prithee let us consider what is to be done.


Well, my Dear, I must open my heart to thee; I am so much in Love with this
Bellfort, that I shall dye if I lose him


Poor Isabella, dying is something an inconvenient business; and yet I should
live very uncomfortable without my Spark


Our time's very short, therefore preethee let us play the fool no longer, but
come to the point when we meet 'em


Agreed: But when shall we meet 'em?


I warrant thee before Midnight.


Come, let us take one turn in the Garden, and by that time my Dinner will be
ready


Madam, For Heaven's sake consider on what a short time my Happiness or Ruin
depends


Have a care, Sir Ieffery and his Lady will be Jealous.


This is a good sign.


Not a word, we shall be suspected, at night we will design a cenferrence.


Why so unkind Cl^d? You frown and wonnot kiss me.


No marry, ^^e be none of thy Imp, I wott.

I Will tie you up now to the Rack.
Well met Sisters, where^s my Pucklin?

Oh who has switcht and spurd me plaguely, I am raw all over me, whoo has
ridden a wounded way about too


Ointment for Flying here I have,


Of Poplar Leaves, and Aconite made
With these.
The Aromattic Reed I boil,
With Water-parsnip, and Cinquesoil;
With store of Soot, and add to that,
The reeking Blood of many a Bat.


I fetch^d to open Locks at need.

All flowing lo^sly in the Air,
With naked Feet I went among

With A^omt^ and Martagon,
Henbane, Hemlock, Moon-wort too,

The deadly Nightshade, Cypress, Yew,
And Libbards Bane, and venomous Dew,
I gathered for my Charms. Harg.
Dug up a Mandrake which did cry,
Three Circles I made, and the Wind was good,
And looking to the West I stood.


With Screetch-Owls Eggs, and Feathers too.

The Eyes of Owls, and Brains of Cats.

Peace, here is our Master him Salute,
And kiss the Toe of his Cloven Foot,
Now our new Sister we present,
The Contract too, sign it with Blood.

First, Heaven you must renounce.

I do.

Your Baptism, thus I wash out too.
The new Name Maudlin you must take,
And all your Gossips must forsake,
And I these new ones for you make.

A piece of your Garment now present.

Here, take it Master, I Am content.

Within this Circle I make here,
Truth to our Master you must swear.

I do.

You must each month some murdered Children pay,
Besides your yearly tribute at your day.

I will.

Some Secret part I with my mark must sign.
A lasting token, that you are wholly mine.

Oh!

Now do your Homage.

Curse Heaven, Plague Mankind, go forth and be a Witch.

WElcome, welcome, happy be,
In this blessed Society.
Men and Beasts are in thy Power,
Thou can Save, and can Devour,
Thou can Bless, and Curse the Earth,
And cause Plenty, or a Dearth.
Welcome, etc.
Over Natures Powers thou can prevail,
Raise Winds, bring Snow, or Rain, or Hail;
Without their Causes, and can make
The steady Course of Nature shake.
Welcome, etc.
Thou can mount upon the Clouds,
And skim over the ruggid Floods;
Thou can dive to the Sands below,
And through the sollid earth can go.
Welcome, etc.
Thou Wilt open Looks, or through a Chink
Shall creep for daintiest Meat and Drink.
Thou may sleep on tops of Trees,
And lie in Flowers like Humble Bees.
Welcome, etc.
Revenge, revenge, the sweetest part
Of all thou have by thy black Art.
O^ Heaven thou never shall f^x thy mind,
For here it is Heaven to plague mankind.

And all the Elements make war or peace:
The Sky no more shall its known Laws obey,
Night shall retreat whilst you prolong the day.

And in thick darkness, hide the Sun at Noon.


Hearing thy mighty Charms, the troubled Sky
Shall crack with Thunder, Heaven not knowing why.

Then though all Winds together should engage,
The silent Sea shall not the Tempest feel.


Stones from their Quarries, and fixed Oaks remove.

The most impetuous Torrents shall stand still:
Swift Rivers shall (while wondering Banks admire)
Back to their Springs, with violent have, retire.



And any living creature save or kill:


Who Is here? who is here?

Waunds what^s here? The Witches By'r Lady,
I Will shoot amongst 'em: have at ye.
Hey, Dive-dappers, Dive-dappers:
What a Devils here! Clod tied by a Bridle and Neighing! What a Pox ail'st thou?
Constable a tell?

Uds flesh, I am a Mon again naw!
Why, I was a Horse, a mere Tit, I had lost aw
My speech, and coul'd do naught but neigh;
Flesh I am a Mon again.

What a dickens is the fellee wood?

Ise ta the Bridle with me, fly from the Dee'l, and the Witches, and I Will tell
yo
aw at the Alehouse.

What a murrain ails the Hobbell?
I mun follow, and see what is the matter.

I Am sorry I am forced to complain of my Cousin.


Sorry, marry so am not I; I am sorry she is so pert and ill-bred, truly Sir
Edward it is unsufferable for my Son, a man of his Quality and Title, Born of
such a Family, and so Educated, to be so abused, to have Stones thrown at him
li^e a Dog


We must even break off the Match, Sir Edward.


Sir, I am as^^med of it, I blush and grieve to hear it; Daughter, I never
thought to see this day


Sir, I am so amazed I know not what to say, I abuse my Cousin! Sure he is
b^witched


I think I am, to Love you after it, I am sure my Arm's black and blew, that it
is


He ^ested with me, as I thought, and would have ruffled me, and kissed me, and
I run from him, and in foolish play, I quoited a little Stone or two at him


And why did you call me Filthy-face, and ugly Fellow, h^h, Gentlewoman?


He ugly! Nay, then I have no Eyes, though I say it, that should not say it,
(...) his Fellow --


Nor I neither: 'twas a jest, a jest, he told me he was handsomer for a Man,
than I for a Woman


Why, look you there, you Blockhead, you Clown, you Puppy, why do you trouble
us with this impertinent lie


Good words, Sir Ieffery, 'twas not so much amiss; hah, I Will tell you that.


Sure this is some mistake, you told me you were willing to marry.


I did not think I should be put to acknowledge it before this Company: But
Heaven knows, I am not more willing to live; the time is now so short, I may
confess it


You would not use him, you intend to marry, ill.


I Love him I am to marry more than Light or Liberty. I have thus long
dissembled it through Modesty; but, now I am provoked, I beseech you Sir, think
not that I Would dishonor you so


Look you, you have made her weep; I never found her false or disobedient.


Nay, good dear Cousin, don't cry, you will make me cry too; I cannot forbear, I
ask your pardon with all my heart, I vow I do, I was to blame, I must confess


Go too, Sir Timothy, I never could believe one of your parts would play the
Fool so


And you will marry to morrow.


I never wished for any thing so much, you make me blush to say this.


Sweet Cousin forgive me, and Sir Ieffery, and Sir Timothy.


Can I be angry at any thing* when I am to be married to morrow? And I am sure
I will be, to him I love more than I hate this Fool


I could find in my heart to break your head, Sir Timothy, you are a Puppy.


Come lets leave 'em together, to understand one another better.


Cousin, Daughter I should say, I beg your pardon, your Servant.


Servant, Sweet Daughter.


Dear Cousin be in good humor, I could wish my self well beaten for mistaking
one that loves me so, I would I might never stir, if I did not think you had
been in earnest: well, but I vow and swear I am mightily beholden to you, that
you think me so fine a person, and love me so dearly; Oh how happy am I that I
shall have thee to morrow in these Arms! by these ten bones, I love you more
than all the Ladies in London put them together. Prithee Speak to me, O that
Smile Kills me, oh I will ^o Hug thee and Kiss thee, and Love thee to morrow
night -- I Would give forty pound to morrow night were to night, I hope we shall
have twins before the year comes about


Do you so Puppy?


Help, Help, Murder, Murder.


Help, Help, Murder, Murder.


What a Devils to do now? hah, she Counterfeits a Sound.


How now, my Dear, what is the matter?


What Is the Matter?


I feel the matter, She gave me a Cuff, and lug'd me by the Ears, and I think
she is in a Sound


Oh the Witch! the Witch came just now into the Room, and struck Sir Timothy,
and Lug'd him, and beat me down


Oh Lord, a Witch! Ay, 'twas a two legged Witch.


And, as soon as she had done, she run out of that Door.


It Is very true, I met her and was frighted, and left her muttering in the next
(...)


Oh Impudence!


You Puppy, you Coxcomb, will you never leave these lies, is the fellow
bewitched


Go Fool, I am ashamed of you.


Let^s see if we can take this Witch.


Quickly, before she flies away.


Well, I have done, I Will never tell tale more.


Begone, Fool, go.


Well, I will ^ndure this, but I am resolved to marry her to morrow and be
revenged on her; if she serves me so then, I will tickle her Toby for her,
faith I will


Well, I Will be gone, and get out of the way of 'em.


Come on.


Madam! Cozen hold a little, I desire a word with you.


I must stay.


Adieu then.


I am drunken well (...), and now I am not so hala (since we must marry to
morrow) I pray you n^w let us be a little better acquainted to neeght, He make
bold to Salute you in a Civil way


The Fool's drunk.


By the Mass she kisses rarely, uds lud she has a Breath as sweet as a Cow, I
have been a Hawking, and have brought you home a power of Powts in my bag here;
we have had the rarest sport, we had been at it still, but that it is neeght


You have been at some other sport I see.


What, because I am merry? nay, and I list, I can be as merry as the best on
^em all

An onny mon Smait my Sweet hear^,
Ayst Smait him again an I con,
Flesh what care for a brokken Yead,
For onest a mon's a mon.

I see you can be merry indeed.


Ay that I can, Fa, la, la, fa, la.

I was at it helter Skelter in excellent Ale, with Londoners that went a
Hawking, brave Roysters, honest fellows that did not believe the Plot


Why don't you believe the Plot?


No, the Chaplain has told me all; there is no Popish Plot, but there is a
Presbyterian one, he says, none but Phanaticks believe it


An Excellent Chaplain to make love to his Patrons Daughter, and Corrupt the
Son

Why all the Eminent men of our Church believe it; this fellow is none of the
Church, but crept into it for a livelihood, and as soon as they find him they will
turn him out of it


Nay, Cousin I should not have told it, he Charged me to say nothing of it; but
you and I a^e all one, you are to be bone of my bone to morrow: And I will
Salute you once more upon that do you see


Hold, Hold, not so fast it is not come to that yet.


'Twill come to that and more to morrow, fa, la, la, but I Will out at four a
Hawking, though for all that, do you understand me


Her'es Doubty, I must get rid of this fool.

Cousin, I hear your Father coming; if he sees you in this Condition he will be
very Angry


Thank you Kindly, no more to be said, I Will go and Sleep a little, I see she
loves me, fa, la, la, la


Dear Madam, this is a happy (...) thrown upon me unexpectedly, and I must use
it: To morrow is the faral day to ruin me


It shall not ruin me: the Inquisition should not force me to a Marriage with
this fool


This is a step to my Comfort; but when your Father shall to morrow hear your
refusal, you know not what his passion may produce; restraint of Liberty is the
least


He shall not restrain my Liberty of Choice.


Put your self into those hands that may defend you from his Power: the hands
of him, who loves you more than the most Pious value Heaven, than Misers Gold,
than Clergy men love Power, than Lawyers strife, than Jesuits Blood and
Treachery


If I could find such a man.


Then look no farther Madam, I am he; speak but one word, and make me the
happiest man on Earth


It comes a little to quick upon me; are you sure you are the man you speak of?


By Heaven; and by your Self I am, or may I be the scorn of all Mankind; and
the most Miserable too, without you


Then you shall be the man.


Heaven; on my Knees I must receive this Blessing; there is not another I would
ask, my Joy's too big for me


No Raptures for Heavens sake, here comes my Mother, adieu.


I must Compose my self.


Sir your most humble Servant.


Your Ladyships most humble Servant.


It is not fit I should lose this opportunity, to tell you that (which perhaps
may not be unacceptable to a person of your Complexion) who is so much a
Gentleman, that I Will swear I have not seen your equal


Dear Madam, you confound me with your Praises.


I vow it is true; indeed I have strugled with my self before I thought fit to
reveal this: but the consideration of your great accomplishments, do indeed, as
it were, ravish, or extort it from me, as I may so say


I beseech you Madam.


There is a Friend of mine, a Lady (whom the world has acknowledged to be well
bread, and of Parts too, that I must say, and almost confess) not in the Bud
indeed, but in the Flower of her Age, whom time has not yet invaded with his
injuries; in fine, envy cannot say that she is less than a full ripe Beauty


That this Creature should bring forth such a Daughter.


Fair of Complexion, Tall, Straight, and shaped much above the ordinary; in
short, this Lady (whom many have Languished, and Sighed in vain for) does of
her self, so much admire your Person, and your Parts, that she extremely
desires to contract a Friendship with you, entire to all intents and purposes


It Is impossible she should be in earnest, Madam, but were she, I cannot Marry
ever


Why she is Married already, Lord how dull he is! she is the best Friend I
have, Married to an old man, far above her sprightly years


What a Mother-in-Law am I like to have!


Can you not Guess who this is all this while?


Too well.
Not I truly Madam.

Ha, ha, ha, no! that is strange, ha, ha, ha.


I cannot possibly.


Ha, ha, ha. I Will swear! ha, ha, ha.


No, I^le swear.


It Is very much, you are an ill guesser, I Will vow, ha, ha, ha! Oh Lord, not yet?


Not yet, nor ever can.


Here Is Company, retire.


I am all on fire, what is it that Inspires me! I thought her ugly once, but
this morning thought (...) in love already! Sure I was blind, she is a beauty
(...) a minutes absence is death to me


Phaat Joy, dou art in Meditaation and Consideraation upon something? if it be
a Scruple upon thy Conscience, I believe I will maak it out unto dee


No Sir, I am only ruminating a while; I am inflamed with her affection, O
Susan! Susan! Ah me! Ah me


Phaat do dou not mind me? nor put die thought upon me? I do desire to know of
die Faathers Child, what he does differ from de Caatholick Church in, by my fait
it is a braave Church, and a gaallant Church (de Devil taake me) I will tell
you now, phare is dear such a one? vill you speak unto me now Joy, hoh


It Is a fine Church, a Church of Splender, and riches, and power, but there are
some things in it --


Shome things! Phaat dosht dou taalk of shome things? By my shoule I will not
see a better Church in a Shommers day, indeed, dan de Caatholick Church. I tell
you there is braave dignities, and promotions too; what vill I shay unto you?
by St. Phaatrick, but I do believe I will be a Cardinal before I will have
death. Dey have had not one Eerish Cardinal a great while indeed


What power is this that urges me so fast, oh Love! Love!


Phaat dosht dou shay, dosht dou love promotions and dignities? den I predee
now be a Caatholick. What vill I say unto you more? but I will tell you, You do
shay dat de Caatholicks may be shaved, and de Caatholicks do shay, dat you vill
be after being damned, and phare is de solidity now of daat, daat dou vill not
turn a good Caatholick


I cannot believe there is a Purgatory.


No! Phy I will tell you what I will shay unto you, I have sheen many Shoules
of Purgatory dat did appear unto me; And by my trot, I do know a Shoule when I
do she it, and de Shoules did speak unto me, and did deshire of me dat I vould
pray them out of that plaashe: And dear Paarents, and Friends did give me shome
money, and I did pray 'em out. Widout money indeed, we cannot pray them out, no
fait


That may not be so hard; but for Transubstantiation, I can never believe it.


Phaat dosht not believe de Cooncel of Trent Joy? dou vilt be damned indeed,
and de Devil take me, if dou dosht not believe it. I will tell you phaat vill I
say to you, a Cooncel is infalible; and I tell you, de Cardinals are infalible
too, upon occaasion, and dey are damned Heretic Dogs, by my shoulvaation, dat
do not believe every oord dey vill speak indeed


I feel a flame within me, oh Love, Love, wether will thou carry me?


Art thou in love Joy? by my shoule dou dosht Comitt fornicaation, I will tell
you it is a venial Sin, and I will after be absolveing you for it: but if dou
dosh Comitt Marrage, it is mortal, and dou vilt be damned and be fait and

Oh, I have a Million of Needles Pricking my Bowels.


I will, set up a hubub for dee, help! help! who is dear? help, Aboo, boo, boo.


Oh Needles! Needles! Take away Mal. Spencer, take her away.


He is bewitched, some Witch has gotten his Image, and is tormenting it.


Hold him, and I will taak some course vid him, he is possessed, or obess'd, I will touch him vid some Relics


Oh, good Sir, help him, what shall I do for him?


Get some Lead melted (and holding over his body) power it into a Poringer full
of Water, and if there appear any image upon the Lead, then he is bewitched


Peash, I shay, here is shome of St. Phaatricks own Whisker, and some of the
Snuff he did use to taak, dat did hang upon his Beard; here is a Tooth of St.
Winifred, indeed, here is a Corn from de Toe of St. Ignatius, and here is de
paring of his Nails too


Oh worse, worse, take her away.


By my shoule it is a very strong Devil, I will try some more, here is St.
Caaterine de Virgins Wedding-Ring, here is one of St. Bridge^s Nipples of her
Tuggs, by my shoule, here is some of de sweat of St. Francis, and here is a
piece of St. Laurence's Gridiron, dese vill make Cure upon any shickness, if it
be not ones lasht shickness


What will become of me, I have poisoned him, I shall lose my Lover, and be
hanged into the bargain


Oh! I dye, I dye, oh, oh.


By my shoule it is a very strong Devil, a very aable Devil, I will run and
^etch shome Holy-vater


Look up, dear Sir, speak to me, ah woes me, Mr. Smerk, Mr. Smerk.


This Irishman is a Gallant man about Witches, he out does me.


But I do not know what to think of his Popish way, his Words, his Charms, and
Holy Water, and Relics, methinks he is guilty of Witchcrast too, and you
should send him to Goal for it


Oh! oh!


Now, I varrant you Joy, I will do de Devil's business for him, now I have dis
Holy-Vater.


This is wonderful!


Most amazing!


Conjure te malum (...), Conjure te pessir^^ in (...), read mihi me^^ ((...)

It Is strange: You se he does not fear holy water.


I tell you phaat is de matter, by my Shoule he vill touch de Bottle, because
daat is not Consecrate; but, by my fait, he will not meddle vid de Vater. I will ferch shome, I have in a Baashon


He lies as if he were a Sleep.


Oh! I begin to have some ease.


I did never meet vid a Devil dat did Cosht so much Laabour before.

Exercis^ te Demonens fuge, fuge, Exerciso te, per Melchefideck, per Bethlehem
Gabor, per omne quod Exit in um seu Graecum sive Latinum


I am much better now, and the Witch is gone.


Good Sir retire to your Chamber, I will fetch some Cordials.


Sweet beautiful Creature! How I am Enamored with thee! Thy beauty dazles like
the Sun in his Meridian


Beauty, Enamourd! Why he seems distracted still; lead him to his Chamber, and
let him rest


Now Joy, dosht dou she, I have maade a Miracle by my shoule. Phen vill I she
one of your Church maake a Miracle, hoh? by my Shoulevaation dey cannot maake
Miracles out of de Caatolick Church, I tell you now, hoh

Phaat is de matter now, ah? by my shoule shomething does cuff upon my faash,

What is this, I hear the blows, and see nothing.


So do I, I am frighted and amazed; lets fly.


Oh, oh, vat is dis for Joy, oh, all my Holy-Vater is gone, I must fly.


All this day have I watched for this opertunity, let me improve it now.
Consider, Madam, my Extreme Love to you, and your own harred to that Fool, for
whom you are designed to morrow


My consent is to be had first.


Your Fathers resentment of your refusal, may put you out of all possibillity
of making me happy, or providing for your own Content


To Marry one against his Consent is a Crime heel never forgive.


Though his Engagement to Sir Ieffery would make him Refuse his Consent
beforehand: He is too reasonable a man to be troubled afterward, at your
Marrying to a better Estate, and to one that loves more than he can tell you: I
have not words for it


Though I must Confess you may deserve much better, would you not Imagine I
were very forward to receive you upon so short an Acquaintance


Would I had a Casement in my Breast. Make me not, by your delay, the
miserablest wretch on Earth. (Which I shall ever be without you) think quickly
Madam, you have not time to Consider long, I lay my self at your Feet, to be
for ever made happy or miserable by you


How shall I be sure you will not deceive me? These hasty vows, like Angry words,
Seldom shoes the Heart


By all the Powers of Heaven and Earth.


Hold, Swear not, I had better take a man of honor at his Word.


And may Heaven throw its Curses on me when I break it; my Chaplin's in the
House, and passes for my valet de Chamber. Will you for ever make me Happy
Madam


I Will trust your honor; and I Will make my self so; I throw my self upon you, use
me nobly: now it is out


Use ye, as I would use my Soul; my Honor, my Heart, my Life, my Liberty, and
all I have is yours. There Is not a man in all the World, that I can envy now,
or wish to be


Take care, we shall be spyed: The short time I have to resolve in, will, I
hope, make you have a better Opinion of my modesty, than otherwise you would
have occasion for


Dearest! Sweetest of Creatures! my Joy distracts me, I cannot speak to you.


For Heavens sake leave me, if you raise a Jealously in the House I am ruined,
we'll meet soon


Adieu my Life! my Soul! I am all obedience.


Oh my Dear, I am happy, all is out that pained me so; my Lover knows I love him.


I have Confessed to my Ghostly Father too, and my Conscience is at ease.


Mine received the news with more Joy, than he Could put in Words.


And mine in rapture; I am the happiest Woman Living.


I Will not yield to you at all in that.


There Is no cause, I would not submit to you in, but this my Dear.


I will hold out in this cause while I have breath, I am happier in my Choice
than all the World can make me


Mine is the Hansomest, Wittiest, most accomplished Gentleman --


Mine is the beautifullest, sweetest, well-shap'd, well-bred, wittiest
Gentleman --


That must be I, whom she means, for all my Quarrels with her.


Peace, we shall hear more.


Little think our Fathers how happy we shall be to morrow.


What Is that? Listen.


(If no unlucky Accident should hinder us) we shall be far happier than they
can Imagine


How we have Cheated them all this while!


'Slife they are behind us, stir not. We have hidden our love from them all
this while


Have you so? but we shall find it now.


Your Brother Little thinks I Love him so; For I have been Cross and coy to him
on purpose. I shall be the happiest Woman in him, I am to have, that ever was


I could wish your Brother loved me as well as mine does you. For never Woman
loved the man she was to Marry as I do him, I am to have to morrow


That Is my best Daughter, thou were ever a good Child, nay blush no^, all is
out, we heard ye both


Ay, all is out, my pretty Dear dissembler: well, I protest and vow, I am
mightily obliged to you for your great love to me, and good opinion of me


I hope to morrow will be a happy day for both our families.
Oh Sir Edward, is not that strange I told you, I should not have believed it
if I had not seen it


And pray give me the same liberty: But now we will have some music, that is good
against enchantment, Sing me the Song I Commanded you, and then we will have a
dance before we go to bed


Hoh, it is a pretty Shong, but I will shing a brave Cronan now, dat is better I
tell you


It Is very fine but sing me one Song more in three parts, to sweeten our Ears,
for all that.


Do you play, play I say, Oh they are bewitched, I will shay no more.


Play I say.


I cannot, my Arms are on the sudden stiff as marble, I cannot move them.


Sure this is roguery, and Confederacy.


Conjuro te conjuro in nonime, etc.


Hold, hold, prithee don't duck us all we are not all bewitched.


I tell you it ish good for you an be, and vill defend you upon occasion.


Now you see, Sir, with your own Eyes; cannot you give us a Receipt to make
Holy Water


A Resheit, aboo, boo, boo; by my Shoule he is a Fool. I have ma^^e two
Hogsheads gra: and I will have you vash all de Rooms vid it, and de Devil vill
not come upon de plaash by my Shalvaation


It Is a little odd; but however, I shall not fly from my Belief, that every
thing is done by Natural Causes, because I cannot presently assign those Causes


You are in the right, we know not the powers of matter.


When any thing unwonted happens, and we not see the cause, we call it
unnatural and miraculous


By my Shoule you do talk like Heretick-Dogs, and Aathiests.


Let us enquire farther about these Musicians.


I will maake shome Miracles, and I think I will be after reconcileing them
indeed, oh dou damned vitch.


Byr Lady it is meeghty strong Ale, Ay am well neegh drunken, and my Nephew will
be stark wood, his Hawks want their Pidgeon saw this neeght


Why what wouden yeow be a Angee? Flesh, Ay ha getten de Bridle byr Lady, Ayst
ma some body carry me, and be my Titt too


You Are a strange Fillee (Horse I should say) why did thou think thou wast a
Titt when the Bridle was on thee


Ay marry, I know weel I am sure, I wott I was a Titt, a mere Titt.


Listen, there is a noise of women in the Air, it comes toward us.


Ay by th'Mass, it is Witches.




Wawnds and Flesh it is a flock of Witches byr Lady, they come reeght ore head,
Is It let fly at 'em, hah, be the mass I ha mamed one, here is one has a wing
brocken at least


M. Spencer by the mass.


O Rogues! I Will be revenged on you, Dogs, Villains, you have broken my Arm.


I was made a Horse, a Titt by thee, by the mass Is It be revenged o'thee.

Horse, Horse, be thou to me.
And carry me where e're I flee.

O'ds Flesh, what is this? I connot believe my Senses; I mun walk home alone,
but I Will charge my Piece again byr Lady, and the Haggs come again Is It have
the other Shoot at 'em


My Dear Friend, I am so transported with excess of Joy, it is become a pain, I
cannot bear it


Dear Bellfort! I am in the same Case, but (if the hope transports us so) what
will Enjoyment do


My Blood is chill, and shivers when I think on it.


One night with my Mistress would outweigh an Age of Slavery to come.


Rather than be without a nights Enjoyment of mine, I would be hanged next
morning: I am Impatient till they appear


They are Women of Honor, and will keep their Words; your Parson's ready, and
three or four of our Servants for Witnesses


He is so, 'twill be dispatched in half a quarter of an hour, all are retired
to bed


Go in, yonder is my Lady-Mother-in-Law coming, I must contrive a way to secure
her: in, in


I go.


Death, that this old Fellow should be asleep already! she comes now to
discover, what I know too well already


He is there I Will swear, a punctual Gentleman, and a person of much honor;
Sir, I am come according to your appointment; Sir Ieffery is fast


It Is before I expected, Madam, I thought to have left Bellfort asleep, who is
a Jealous man, and believes there is an Intrigue betwixt your Ladyship and me


I vow: ha, ha, ha, me! no, no; ha, ha, ha.


Retire for a short time, and when I have secured him, I Will wait on you; but
let it be in the dark


You speak like a Discreet and Worthy Person, remember this Room, there is no
body lies in it; I will stay there in the dark for you


Your most humble Servant. Well, I will go to the Ladies Chamber as if I
^istook it for mine, and let them know this is the time


Dear is shometimes de pretty Wenches, do walk here in de dark at night, and
by my Shoulvaation if I do catch one, I will be after enjoying her Body: and
fait and trot I have a great need too, it is a venial Sin, and I do not care


Death, who is here? stay Ladies, here is the damned Priest in the way.


Go you, we will follow by and by in the dark.


I hear one trampling, he is come already, sure Bellfort is asleep; who is
there


By my Shoul it is a Woman's speech, it is I; where are you? by my fait I will
maak a Child upon her Body


Mr. Doubty.


Ay, let me put a sweet Kish upon die hand Joy, and now I will Shalute die Mout,
and I will embraash die Body too indeed


S'life, I am mistaken, this is the Irish Priest; his understanding is sure to
betray him


I predee now Joy be not nishe, I will maak shome good sport vid dee indeed.

Hoo now, phaare is die hand now? oh,
Here it is by my Shoule.
I will use dee braavely upon occaasion, I will tell you, predee kish me upon
my Faash now, it is a braave kish indeed

By my Shoul don art very hansome, I do know it, dough I cannot she dee. I
predee now retire vid me, aboo, aboo, by my Shoule dis is a Gaalant occaasion,
come Joy


What Is the meaning of this? he talked to some Woman, and kissed her too, and
is retired into the Chamber I was in


Every thing is quiet, I hear no noise.


Nor I, this is the happy time.


This must be he; who is there?


S'life! this is my Mothers voice, retire softly.


Oh Misfortune! What makes her here? we are undone if she discovers us.


Whose there I say? will you not answer? what can this mean? it is not a Wench I
hope for Doubty, and then I care not

I am impatient till he comes; ha, whom have we here? I am sure this is not he,
he does not come that way


By my shoul Joy, dou art a Gaalant piece of Flesh, a braave Bedfellow, phoo
art dou


One that loves you dearly.


Phaat vill I do to she die faash I wonder? Oh, here is a light approaching
unto us


Who Is this with a light? I must fly.


Now I will she die faash.


O, Sir, are you there? I am going to Mr. Smirk with this Candle poor man.


O phaat have I done? Oh! de Vich! de Vich!


Oh! the Witch! the Witch!


By my Shoule I have had communicaation and Copulaation too vid a Succubus; Oh!
phaat vill I do! phaat vill I do! by my fait and trot, I did tought she had
been a braave and gaallant Lady, and be, oh! oh


What shriek was that? hah! here is nobody, sure all is clear now!


I heard a shriek, this is the time to venture, they are frighted out of the
Gallery, and all is clear now


Let Us venture; we shall have people stirring very early this morning to
prepare for the Wedding else


Ha! who is that?
I am terribly afraid: Heaven!
what is this! the Chamber door opened, and I saw a woman
(...) in, I am enraged, I Will distrub 'em.
Isabella, The dosia, Bellfort, Doubty disguised, Parson and Servants in the
Chamber


You see we are women of words, and women of courage too, that dare venture
upon this dreadful business


Welcome, more welcome than all the Treasures of the Sea and Land.


More welcome than a Thousand Angels.


Death! we are undone, one knocks.


Curse on 'em; keep the door fast.


Gentlemen open the door for Heavens sake, quickly.


Open it, we are ruined else; we will into the Bed, you know what you have to do.


Gentlemen, the House is alarmed with Witches, and I saw two come into this
Chamber, and come to give you notice


Here are none but whom you see.


They come invisibly then; for we had our eyes on the door.


Are they not about the Bed somewhere? Let Us search.


There are no Witches there, I can assure you.


Look a little, I warrant you.


Open the door quickly, quickly, the Witches are there.


Oh! my Husband, I am ruined if he sees me here.


Put out the Candles,


Oh! Oh! I have broken my knees; this is the Witches doing: I have loast my
Wife too: lights, lights there


I Will not stay here.


Here Is no staying for us.


Quickly, go by the Wall.


For Heavens sake let us into the Gallery and call for lights.


A Curse upon this Fellow and all ill luck.


Hell take him, the Ladies are gone too.


WHat unfortunate disapointments have we met with!


All ill luck has conspired against us this night.


We have been near being discovered, which would have ruined us.


And we have but this night to do our business in; if we dispatch not this
affair now, all will come out to morrow


I tremble to think on it; sure the surprise the Ladies were in before, has
frighted 'em from attempting again


I rather think that they have met with people, in the Gallery, that have
prevented 'em


Now I reflect, I am apt to think so too; for they seem to be very hearty in
this matter. Once more go to their Chamber


Go you in then to ours.


Hold, Mr. Doubty.


A Curse on all damned luck, is she here?


Sweet Madam, is it you! I have been watching, for Bellfort's sleeping ever
since

I venture hard, since Sir Ieffery missed me out of Bed, I had much a-do to
^asten an excuse upon him


I am so afraid of Bellforts coming, Madam, he was here but even now: The
hazard of your honor puts me in an Agony


O dear Sir, put out the Candle, and he can never discover any thing; besides,
we will retire into you Room


Death, what shall I do now.


And since it is dark, and you cannot see my Blushes, I must tell you, you are
a very ill guesser; for I my self was the person I discrib'd


Oh Madam! you raille me, I will never believe it while I live; it is
impossible


I Will swear it is true: Let us withdraw into that Room, or we shall be
discovered

Oh Heaven, I am undone, my Husband with a light run into your Chamber.


It Is a happy deliverance.


I Will counterfeit walking in my sleep.


Where is this Wife of mine? She told me she fell asleep in the Closet, at her
Prayers, when I mist her before; and I found her there at my coming back to my
Chamber: But now she is not there I am sure. Ha! here she is. Ha, what is she
blind! she takes no notice of me! how gingerly she treads


Oh! stand off -- who is that would kill my dear Sir Ieffery? stand off I say.


Oh Lord, kill me! where! ha! here is nobody.


Oh! the Witch, the Witch, oh she pulls the clothes off me. Hold me, dear Sir
Ieffery, hold me


On my Conscience and Soul she walks in her sleep.


Oh, all the Clothes are off, cover me, oh I am so cold!


Good lack a day, it is so! my Dear, my Lady.


Hah, hah.


Wake I say, wake.


Ah.


It Is I my dear.


Oh Heaven! Sir Ieffery, where am I?


Here in the Gallery.


Oh! how came I here?


Why, thou did walk in thy sleep; good lack a day, I never saw the like.


In my sleep say you! oh Heaven! I have caught my death. Let Us to Bed, and tell
me the story there


Come on. Ha, ha, ha, this is such a jest! walk in your sleep! godsniggs, I
shall so laugh at this in the morning


This is a happy come off.


If we do not get into this Chamber suddenly, we are undone: They are up in the
Offices already


Never have adventures been so often disapointed, in so short a time.


There Is no body in the Gallery now, we may go.


Have then, and let us fly thither.


Ah, what is this?


Oh! the Witches, the Witches.


Oh mercy upon us, where is this Candle?

So let me tell you, 'Twas no Witch; they were the two young Ladies, that
frighted my dear beauteous Love so; and I Will acquaint their Parents with it
I Will assure you


This is strange, what could they have to do at this time of the night!


I know not. But I well know what I have to do. I am inflamed beyond all
measure, with thy heavenly beauty


Alas, my beauty is but moderate; yet none of the worst, I must needs say.


It Is blasphemy to say so; your eyes are bright like two Twin-Stars; your Face
is an Ocean of beauty; and your Nose a Rock arising from it, on which my heart
did split; Nothing but Ruby and Pearl is about thee; I must blazon thee by
Jewels, thy beauty is of a Noble rank


Good lack, what fine language is this! well, it is a rare thing to be a
Scholar


It Is a miracle I should not think her hansome before this day; she is an
Angel! Isabella is a Dowdy to her. You have an unexhausted mine of beauty. Dear
Mrs. Susan cast thy Smiles upon me, and let me labor in thy Quarry: Love makes
me Eloquent and Allegorical


Sweet Sir, you oblige me very much by your fine Language; but I vow I
understand it not: yet methinks it goes very prettily


I will unfold my hear unto thee; let me approach thy lip, Oh fragrant!

lovely Body in sweet dalliance


How Sir! do you pretend to be a Divine, and would commit this sin! know, I
will preserve my Honor and my Conscience


Conscience? why so you shall, as long as our minds are united. The Casuists
will tell you, it is a Marriage in foro (...)* and besides, the Church of Rome
allows Fornication: And truly it is much practiced in our (...) too. Let us
retire, come, come


Stand off, I defy you: your Casuists are Knaves, and you are a Papist, you
are a foul voluptuous Sw^n^, and I will never smile on you more. Farewell


Hold, hold, Dear, ^^autious Creature, I am at thy mercy: Must I marry then?
speak. Prithee spare me that, and I Will do any thing


Stand off, I scorn thy Love; thou art a pitious Fellow.


Dear Mrs. Susan hear me; let us but do the thing, and then I Will marry thee.


I Will see thee hanged e're I Will trust thee, or e're a Whoremaster of you all.
No, I have been served that trick too often already, I thank you


Must I then Marry?


Yonder Is the Chaplin and Susan;
But this disguise will fright 'em.

Let Us on, we must venture.

I could not rest to night for the Joy of being Married to day: It Is a pretty
Rogue -- she is somewhat Cross -- but I warrant her she will love me, when she
has tried me once


Why would you rise so soon? It Is not day yet.


It Is no matter, I cannot sleep man, I am to be Married Sirrah.


Ay, and therefore you should have slept now, that you might watch the better

Uncivil, ay that it will -- very uncivil: I wont sleep a wink. call my new
Brother-in-Law: Oh here he is, he cannot sleep neither


Set down the Candle; and go bid the Groom get the Horses ready, I must away to

Sir, I cannot come at the Horses, for the People have taken a brace of
Witches, and they are in the stable under a strong guard, that will let no body
come at 'em


Uds flesh, I shall have my Horses bewitched, and lose 500 Pounds worth of
Horse Flesh


No, no, they can do no hurt -- when they are taken the Devil leaves 'em --
Let Us go see 'em --


What shall we do?


Let us stand up close against the Wall.


Listen, here are the Witches, what will become of us?


A Thousand blessings light on thee my Dear Pretty Witch.


O Lord! there is the Devil too Courting of a Witch.


This is the first Night I ever lived, thou Dearest, Sweetest Creature.


Oh! sweet quoth a, that is more than I can say of my self at this time.

And I am a Drunkard; Help, Help, Murder.


What Is the Matter?


Phaat is de matter Joy?


O Nuncle! here have been Devils and Witches: They have flown away with our
Candles, and put us in fear of our lives


Here Is a great Storm Arising -- what can be the matter! the Haggs are at Warck
by'r Lady, and they come to me by'th' mass, I ha getten my brawd Sward: Ay^^

Be not afraid, I will taake a Caare, and I will conjure down this Tempest

Death, it goes out, what will become of us?


An the Witches come, by'r Lady Ayst mow 'em down with my brawd Sward I warrant

What Is this! we are set upon by Cats.


They are Witches in the shape of Cats, what shall we do?


Phaat will I do? Cat, Cat, Cat, Oh, oh.
Conjuro vos ^^gite, fugite. Cacodaem^nes, Cats, Cats.

Have at ye all, I ha Mauld some of 'em by'th' mass, they are fled, but I am
plagneily scratcht


Dey ware afraid of my Charms, and de sign of de Cross did maake them fly --
but d^y have s^ratcht a great deal upon my faash for all daat


Mine is all of a gore blood.


And mine too -- that th^s^ damned Witches should disfigure my Countenance upon
my Wedding day


O Lord, what a Tempest's this?


Heaven! What a Storm is this! The Witches and all their Imps are at work. Who
are these? hah! -- your Faces are all bloody


We have been frighted out of our Wits; we have been assaulted by Witches in
the shape of Cats, and they have scratcht us most ruefully


But I did fright them away, by my Shoule.


Why you are as much mauld as any one, nay, they are at work -- I never
remember such Thunder and Lightning; bid 'em ring out all the Bells at the
Church


I will


Flesh, Christen Bells!


Yes, I believe the great Bell at Oxford was Christened Tom.


And that at Lincoln has a Christen name too.


I tell de Joy, I will carry de hosht and shome relics abroad, and we vill
get a black Chicken and maak one of de Vitches throw it into de Air, and it
vill maak stop upon de Tempest


Why, all the Authors say,


What Is here a haund! uds Flesh, you see I have cut off a haund of one of the
Haggs


Let Us see, this is a lucky evidence; keep it and see what Witch it will fit,
and it is enough to hang her


The Storm begins to stay; I did shay shome Aves, and part of de Gospd of St.
John, and in fine, fugiat Tempestas, and it does go away upon it indeed


We may trace her by her Blood.


But hark you, What Is the reason my Hawks wanted their Pigeons: uds bud I
shall remember you for it; you think to live like a Lubber here and do nothing


Peace, I was drunken, peace good Sir Timothy, Ayst do no more so.


Methinks all on a sudden the Storm is laid.


Sir, the Constable and the rest of us have taken the whole flock of Witches:
but they fell upon us like Cats first; but we have beaten 'em into Witches, and
now we have 'em fast


So now, their Power's gone when they are taken, let us go see 'em.


I Will wash my face and away a Hawking, now the Storm's over, it is broad day.


I will call up Sir Edward; Music, and wake the two Brides with a Serenade
this morning


It has been a dreadful Storm, and strangely laid of the sudden, this is a
joyful day to me: I am now in hopes to strengthen and preserve my Family -- my
poor Daughter has the worst on it, but she is discreet; and will mould Sir
Timothy to what she pleases: he is good nature, ^, and he loves her, and his
Estate's beyond Exception. -- Go call my Son to me, bid him rise, it is day, put
out the Candle now.

How now, your Face scrach't! what were you drunk last night, and have been at
Cuffs


No, Sir Timothy, I, and Tegue O Devilly, and Tom. Shaklehead were assaulted by
Witches in the Shapes of Cats; and Tom. Shaklehead has cut off one of the Cats
hands; and all the Witches are taken, and are in the Stable under a strong
Guard


What foolish wild story is this? you have been drunk in Ale, that makes such
foggy Dreams


Sbud Sir, the story is true, you will find it so.


How now! what makes you booted upon your Wedding Day?


Why, I am going a Hawking this morning, and I Will come home time enough to be
married


Thou most incorrigible Ass, whom no precept or example can teach common sense
to, that would have made thee full of Joy at thy approaching happiness; it would
have filld thy mind, there could have been no room for any other object; to
have a good Estate settled upon thee, and to be married to a woman of that
Beauty, and that Wit and Wisdom, I have not known her equal, would have
transported any one but such a clod of Earth as thou art: thou art an excrement
broken from me, not my Son


Why Sir, I am transported; but cannot one be transported with Hawking too? I
love it as I love my life, would you have a Gentleman neglect his sports


None but the vilest men will make their sports their business; their books,
their friends, their kindred and their country should concern 'em: such drones
serve not the ends of their Creation, and should be lopt of from the rest of
men


A man had better dye than leave his sport; tell me of books, I think there is
nothing in 'em for my part; and for Music I had as live set in the stocks, as
hear your fine songs; I love a Bagpipe well enough, but there is no Music like
a ^^eep Mouthed Hound


Thou most excessive blockhead, thou art enough to imbitter all my sweets; thou
art a Wen belonging to me, and I shall do well to cut thee off: but do you hear
Fool, go and dress your self, and wait upon your Bride, or by Heaven I will
disinherit you. This is the Critical day, on which your happiness or misery
depends; Think on that


Was ever so devilish a Father to make one neglect one's sport, because he is no
sports-man himself; A Pox on Marrying, could not I Hawk and Marry too? well I
am resolved I Will steal out after I am Married


Come on: Place your selves just by her Chamber and play -- and sing that Song
I love so well


My Dear, my sweet, and most delicious Bride
Awake, and see thine own Dear waiting at thy Door;
Surely she cannot sleep for thinking of me, poor Rogue.



Well, you have a pleasant way with you, you will never leave your pretty humors,
I see that


Ha! Thou have been scratching with Wenches, was not thy face ugly enough, but
thou must disfigure it more than Nature has done? one would have thought that
had don't enough


Faith thou art a pretty wag, Thou It never leave thy Roguery; Wenches, why
'twas done by Witches, who in the shape of Cats, had like to have killed us:
your Brother, my Uncle, and the Irish man are all as bad as I


Prithee begone, and mend thy Face, I cannot bear it.


Ay, ay, it is no matter, I Will come into thy Chamber, I must be famil^ar with
you --


And I will be very free with you; you are a Nauseous Fool and you shall never
come into my Chamber. ^S life, would your begin you Reign before you are
Married? no, I Will dominere now -- begone


Nay, faith I Will not leave you so, you little Cross Rogue you; open the door
there, let me in, let me in I say


Who Is that? Thou art my love, come into my arms.


Oh the Witch! the Witch! help,


So, Now thou art come, my Dear, I Will dispatch the Witches, they are all taken
and Guarded in the stable: Clod, bid 'em bring em all hither


That Is well, are they caught? let 'em come before us, we will order 'em.


I would do nothing without thee my Dear.


Here Lady Taake some


Thank you Sir.


I did give die Husband shome before Joy, but I will speak a word unto you all,
let every one


It shall be done.


Daat is very well now.

Let no Vitch Eerland* that kill vid deir Countenance.


This is a very Learned and Wise man.


He is a great man indeed, we are nothing to him.


You vill she now, now I will speak unto them, here dey come; I shay bring
their Arshes before deir Faashes


Bring 'em backward, thus.


You Clod, and you Tom. Shacklehead have sworn sufficiently against the Witch
Spencer, and so has that Country Fellow


I am an Innocent Woman, and they have broken my arm with a shot, Rogues,
Villains, Murderers


Dey are angry, daat is a certain sign of a Vitch; and dey cannot cry, Bodin
dosh shay, daat a Vitch can cry three drops vid her right Eye, I tell you


Have you searched 'em all as I bid you Woman?


Yes an't please your Worship, and they have all great Biggs and Teates in many
parts, except Mother Madge, and hers are but small ones


It is enough, make their Mittimus, and send 'em all to Goal.


I am Innocent, I am Innocent,
Save my life, I am no Witch,
I am Innocent, save my life.

Ven dey do shay dey are Innocent, and deshire to shave deir lives, it is a
shertain shigne of a Vitch fait and trot


Besides, this Woman Margaret Demdike by name, threatened to be revenged on me,
and my Cow has been sucked dry ever since, and my Child has had fits


She lies, she lies, I am Innocent.


This is she that had a hand cut off, it fits her to a hair.


It Is enough: It Is enough.


Must I be hanged for having my hand cut off? I am Innocent, I am Innocent.


Did not you say to my Wife you would be revenged on me? and has not she be^n
struck with pain in her rump-bone ever since? and did not my Sow cast her
farrow last Night


You should send your Brother to Goal for cutting my hand off.


What for cutting a Cats hand off? you were a Cat when I cut it off.


An't please your Worship this Woman, Gamer Dickinson, Who threped: and
threped, and aw to becaw'd me last Neeght in the Lone, and who said he would be
revenged on me; and this Morning at four a Clock Butter would not come, nor the
Ale warck a bit, who has bewicht it


I have heard enough, send 'em all to the Goal.


You must never give a Witch any Milk, Butter, Cheese, or any thing that comes
from the Cows


Now dou damned Vitch, I will be after sheeing dee hanged indeed, I did taake
her by my shoule --


I am a poor Innocent Woman, I am abused, and I am his wife an't please your
worship: He had knowledge of me in a Room in the Gallery, and did promise me
Marriage


Hah! what is this?


By my Shalvaation I am innocent as de Child unborn, I speak it before Heaven,
I did never make fornicaation in my life. To them. It is malice upon me


There is something in this story, but I dare not speak of it.


I do believe you Mr. O Devilly.


Besides, he is a Popish Priest.


Aboo, boo, boo, a Priest, I will taake de Oades Fait and trot; I did never
taake. Holy Orders since I was bore. Iamaica. Dear is anoder Mental
reservaation too; and it is Lawful


Indeed Sir, I have been told he is a Popish Priest, and has been at Rome.


I speak it in de presence of all de Saints, daat I never did see Rome in all
my life, Vid de eyes of a Lion,


Take away the Witches, there is their Mittimus, carry 'em all to Lancaster.
Witches. I am Innocent, I am Innocent


Come on you Hags, now your Master the Devil has left you.


Sir you must excuse me, I must give you the Oaths upon this Information.


And by my shoule Joy, I will taak them and twenty or thirty more Oades if dou
dosht please indeed, I will take 'em all to serve dee, Fait and Trot


Come into the Hall, there is the Statute Book.


I will go in and see if the Brides be Ready.


Gentlemen, This day I am to do the great Duty of a Father in providing for the
Settlement of my Children; this day we will dedicate to Mirth, I hope you will
partake with me in my Joy


I should have had a greater share in any Joy that could affect so worthy a
man, had not your Daughter been the only Person, I ever saw, whom I could have
fixed my love upon; but I am unhappy that I had not the honor to know you till
it was to late


This had been a great honor to me, and my Daughter, and I am sorry I did not
know it sooner, and assure you it is some trouble upon me


How like a Gentleman he takes it, but I have an Ass, Nay two, to deal with.


Good morrow Brother, our brace of Brides are ready, where are the lusty
Bridegrooms


Heaven grant this may prove a happy day.


Mr. Doubty, was ever such an unlucky Night as we have had.


It Is happy to me who was assured of the love of one, I love much more than all
the Joys on Earth


Now you make me blush, I swear it is a little too much.


Ladies, I wish you much joy of this day.


Much happiness to you.


Brother, good morrow to you; This is a happy day, our families will soon be
one: I have sent all the Witches to the Goal


Had you Evidence enough?


Ay, too much; this Gentleman was accused for being a Papist and a Priest, and
I have given him the Oaths, and my Certificate, and on my Conscience he is a
very good Protestant


It is no matter, I did taak de Oades, and I am a very good Protestant upon
occasion, Fait


Say you so? between you and I, how many Sacraments are there?


How many? by my shoule dear are sheven; how many would would dear be ^ink you
Hob? ^y my shoule I have a dispensaation, indeed I am t^o (...) for 'em fait I

So here are the Bridegrooms.


Oh my Dear pretty Bride, let me kiss thy hand, how joyful am I, that I shall
have my Dear within these arms! ah! now the little Rogue can smile upon me


Cousin good morrow to you, I am glad to see you, how do you do this Morning?


Never better.


God be thanked, I am very glad on it.


Is not the Parson come yet?


Yes Sir, he is very busy at his Breakfast in the buttery: And as soon as he
has finished his Pipe and his Tankard -- he will wait on you: he has Married one
Cupple already, The Chaplin and Mrs. Susan


How!


It Is true.


I am sorry for it, that Chaplin is a Rascal -- I have found him out, and will
turn him away --


Sir, here are some of your Tennants and Country men come to be merry with you,
and have brought their Piper and desire to dance before you


We are come to wish your Worship, my Young Master and Lady Joy of this happy
day


You are kindly welcome Neighbors, this is happiness indeed, to see my Friends,
and all my loving Neighbors thus about me


Heavens bless your good Worship.


These honest men are the strength and sinnews of our Country; such men as
these are uncorrupted, and while they stand to us we fear no Papists, nor
French invasion; this day we will be merry together


Ayst make bold to Dance for joy.


Prithee do --


Hold, there needs no Parson.


What say you?


How!


We are Married already, and desire your blessing.


It is impossible.


Heaven! what is this I see?


Theives! Robbers! Murderers of my honor, I Will hang that Fellow.


What pageantry is this? explain your self.


What a Devil do they mean now!


The truth is Sir, we are Married; we found you Fathers were too far engaged to
break off: I (...) forced us to this way, and nothing else can be a fit excuse


We have designed this ever since last Summer, and any other but a private way,
had certainly prevented it. Let excess of love excuse our fault, Sir Ieffery, I
will exceed what s^tlement was made upon your Daughter


An! I will, Sir, do the same Right to yours.


Flesh and Heart -- I Will Murder her.


Hold Sir, she is mine now; I beseech you moderate your passion.


Oh vile Creature; I Will tear her Eyes out.


Forbear good Madam: What cannot be redrest must be past by --


Thou worst of Theives, thou know I can never pass it by.


Sir Edward, you may do what you will, but I Will go in and meditat^ revenge.


And I --


Hold, hold me, I am bloody minded, and shall commit Murder else; my honor, my
honor, I must kill him, hold me fast, or I shall kill him


For my part Cousin, I wish you Joy, for I am resolved to hunt and hawk, and
course as long as I live --


Cruel Woman, I did not think you would have served me so; I shall ^un mad, and
hang my self an^ walk


Now phaar is de soleedity of all dish -- phy all ish paasht* and what vil you
say now? You must taak shome Consolaation unto you -- Dou must Fornicaate vid
die Moders Maid sharvants; and daat is all one by my shoule


Hold, Gentlemen, who Married you?


This Gentleman, who is under his gray Coat, my Parson.


It Is something unhospitable.


I hope Sir, you will not have cause to repent it; had there been any other way
for me to have escaped perpetual misery, I had not taken this


But you Sir have most Iniurd me.


I beg a thousand pardons, Though I must have perished if I had not done it.


It is no injury Sir, I never could have loved your Son; we must have been
unhappy


And I had been miserable with Sir Timothy.


To say truth, I did not much care for her neither, I had rather not marry.


Eternal Blockhead! I will have other means to preserve my Name: Gentlemen,
your are men of ample Fortunes and worthy Families -- Sir I wish you happiness
with my Daughter, take her


You have given me more than my own Father did, then life and fortune.


You are the best of Fathers and of men.


I will endeavor to appease Sir Ieffery and my Lady.


Your are Generous beyond expression Sir.


Sir, I hope your Worship will pardon me, I am Married to Mrs. Susan.


You are a Villain, that has made love to my Daughter, and corrupted my Son.


Have they told all, I am ruined? good Sir, continue me your Chaplin, and I
will Do and Preach whatever you command me


I Will not have a Divine with so flexible a Conscience, there shall be no such
Vipers in my Family; I will take care you never shall have Orders. But she has
served me well, and I will give her a Farm of 40. l. per annum to Plow: Go Sir,
it was an Office you were born to


Did I not bid de Fornicaate? and dou did Marry Joy; if dou had not maade
Marriage, I vould have maade dee a Catholic, and preferred dee to Saint Omers,
Dey should have bred dee for one of deir Witnesses fait


I must beg your pardon Sir, I have a warrant against this Kelly, Alias Tegue O
Devilly -- he is accused for being in the Plot


My house is no refuge for Traitors Sir.


Aboo, boo, boo! by my shalvaation dear is no Plot, and I will not go vid you.
Dou art a damned Fanaatick, if dou dosht shay dear is a Plot. Dou art a
Presbiterian Dog


No striving, come a long with me.


Phaat vil I do: I am Innocent as de Child dat is to be Born; and if they
vill^hang me, I will be a shaint indeed. My hanging Speech was made for me,
long a go by de Jesuits, and I have it ready, and I will live and die by it, by
my shoule


Gentlemen, I charge you in the Kings Name assist me.


Come Gentlemen, I wish you both the happiness you deserve.
How shallow is our foresight and our prudence!
Be never so wise, design what e're we will
There is a Fate that overrules us still.

A Skilful Mistress uses wondrous Art,
To keep a pevish crazy Lovers Heart,
His awkard Limbs forgetful of Delights,
Must be urged on by Tricks and Painful Nights:
Which the poor Creature is content to bear,
Fine Manteau's and new Petticoats to wear.
And Sirs, your sickly Appetites to raise,
Yhe starving Players try a thousand ways.
Tou had a Spanish Friar of Intrigue,
And now we have presented you a Tegue;
Which with much cost from Ireland we have got,
If he be dull, even hang him for the Plot.

Now have a care, for by my Shoul shalwaation.
Dish vill offend a Party in de Naation.

They that are angry must be very Beasts,
For all Religions laugh at foolish Priests.

By Creesh, I swear, de Poet has undone me,
Some simple Tory vill maake beat upon me.

Good Protestants, I hope you will not see,
A Martyr made of our poor Tony Leigh.
Our Popes and Friars on one side offend,
And yet alas the City's not our Friend:
The City neither like us nor our Wit.
They say their Wives learn ogling in the Pit.
They Are from the Boxes taught to make advances,
To answer stolen Sighs and naughty Glances.
We Virtuous Ladies some new way must seek,
For all conspire our playing Trade to break.
If the bold Poet freely shows his Vein,
In every place the snarling ^ops complain,
Of your gross follies if you will not hear,
With inoffensive Nonsense you must bear.
You, like the Husband, never shall receive,
Half the delight the sportful Wife can give.
A Poet dares not whip this foolish Age,
You cannot bear the Physic of the Stage.
