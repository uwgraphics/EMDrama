THe Soldier Thraso, not knowing so much, brought
With him a Maid which was falsely reported to be Thais's Sister,
And bestowed her on her. This Maid was a Citizen of Athens.
Phaedria a sweetheart of Thais, gives command, that an Eunuch
Which he had bought, should be delivered to her; and goes himself into the
Country
Being entreated to give place to Thraso for two days.
A young stripling Phaedrias's brother (forasmuch as he dearly loved
The little girl which was sent for a present to Thais)
Is clad in the Eunuchs habit. Parmeno persuades him to it.
He went in, he defloureth the Maid. But his brother
Being found to be a Citizen of Athens, bestows her
When she was destoured on the stripling. Thraso over-intreateth Phaedria.
SOrorem falso dictitatam Thaidis,
Id ipsum ignorans miles advext Thraso,
Ipsique donat. Erat haec civis Attica.
Eidem Eunuchum, quem emerat, tradi jubet
Thaidis amator Phaedria, acirus ipse abit,
Thrasoni oratus biduum concederet.
Ephebus frater Phaedriae (puellulam
Cum deperiret dono missam Thaidi,)
Ornatu Eunuchi induitur, suadet Parmeno.
Introiit, vitiat virginem. Sed Atticus
Civis repertus frater ejus, conlocat
Vitiatam ephebo: Phaedriam exorat Thraso.
IF there be any that sets himself to please
All good men and to be offensive to few:
This Poet professes himself to be one of them.
Again if there be any that thinks he is too sharply
Spoken against, let him thus think,
That an Apology, and not an Invection is made, because he did the first wrong,
Who by translating well, but ordering them badly.
Has made bad Latin Comedies of good Greek ones.
The same man has now lately set out Menanders Phasma,
And in his Thesaurus he has set down that the defendant pleaded,
Of whom it was demanded why the gold should be his,
Before the Plaintiff who demands it, declared how the treasure came to be
his
And how it came into his fathers monument.
From henceforth let him not deceive himself, or think thus,
I have now given over, he has nothing to say to me.
I advise him not to mistake himself, and to leave off provoking me.
I have many other things, which shall now be forgiven,
Which shall be produced afterward, if he go on to offend me,
So as he has begun to do. As for this Menanders Eunuchus
Which we are now to act, he obtained, after the Aediles
Had bought it, that he might have liberty to see it;
It began to be acted when the Magistrate was there.
He cry^th out that a thief, not a Poet had set out a Comedy,
And yet bad added no words of his own to it;
That Colax was an old Comedy of Naevius and Plautus,
That the Parasites and Soldiers part were taken thence.
If that be an off nee, it is an offense committed through the Poets ignorance
Who did not purpose to play the thief:
That it is so you may now judge:
Colax is a Comedy of Menanders, in it is Colax the Parasite;
And the braggadocian Soldier he does not deny
That he has translated those parts into his Eunuchus,
Out of the Greek Comedy; but that he knew that those Comedies
Were translated before into Latin, he utterly denies it.
But if it be not lawful for diverse men to use the same parts,
How is it more lawful to introduce running servants
To feign grave matrons, naughty drabs,
A greedy parasite, a b^aggadocian soldier,
A child to be suborned, an old man to be cousened by his servant,
And that folks love, hate, or suspect? To conclude,
There is nothing now said, which has not been said heretofore.
Wherefore it is fitting that you should understand, and pass it by,
If new Comedians do, what the old have used to do.
Do you endeavor, and give silent attention,
That you may fully know what Eunuchus means.
SI quisquam est qui placere se studeat bonis
Quamplurimis, and minime multos laedere,
In his Poeta hic nomen profitetur suum.
Tum si quis est qui dictum in se inclementius
Existimavit esse, sic existimet,
Responsum, non dictum esse, quia laesit prius,
Qui been vertendo, and eas describendo male
Ex Graecis bonis, Latinas fecit non bonas.
Idem Menandri Phasma nunc nuper dedit,
Atque in Thesauris scripsit causam dicere,
Prius unde petitur aurum quare sit suum,
Quam illum qui petit, unde is Thesaurus sit sibi;
Aut unde in patrium monimentum pervenerit.
Dehinc ne fraudetur ipse se, aut sic cogitet,
Defunctus jam sum, nihil est quod dicat mihi,
Is ne erret moneo, and desinat lacessere.
Habeo alia multa nunc quae condonabuntur;
Quae proferentur post, si pergat laedere,
Ita ut facere instituit. Quam nunc sumus acturi
Menandri Eunuchum, postquam aediles emerunt,
Perfecit, sibi ut inspiciund^ esset cop^a.
Magistratus cum ibi adesset, occoepta est agi.
Exclamat furem, non Poetam, fabulam
Dedisse, and nihil dedisse verborum tamen;
Colacem esse Naevi, and Plauti veterem fabulam,
Parasiti personam inde ablatam and militis.
Si id peccatum est, peccatum imprudentia est
Poetae, qui non furtum facere studuerit.
Id ita esse vos jam judicare poteritis.
Colax Menandri est, in ea est parasitus colax,
Et miles gloriosus, eas se non negat
Personas transtulisse in Eunuchum suam
Ex Graeca: sed eas fabulas factas prius
Latinas scisse se, id vero pernegat.
Quod si personis iisdem uti aliis non licet,
Qui magis licet currentes servos scribere,
Bonas matronas facere, meretrices malas,
Parasitum edacem, gloriosum militem,
Puerum supponi, falli per servum senem,
Amare, odisse, suspicari? Denique
Nullum est jam dictum, quod non dictum sit prius,
Quare aequum est vos cognoscere, atque ignoscere,
Quae veteres factitarunt, si faciunt novi.
Date operam, and cum silentio animadvertite,
Ut pernoscatis quid sibi Eunuchus velit.
WHat then shall I do? Should I not go? no, not now
When I am sent for by her of her own accord? or should I rather so behave my
self
As to let her see I cannot put up the abuses of Whores?
She has shut me out of: door, she calls me back again, should I go back
again? no, though she should entreat me


But if you once begin, and not perform it gallantly,
And when you cannot endure, when no body shall desire you,
Before you have made peace, you shall come to her, and tell her
That you love her, and cannot abide without her, all is dashed, you may go
fiddle


Therefore do you consider well of it, while time serves.

Master, you cannot rule that thing by advice,
Which is neither capable of any advice, nor observes any mean.
All these vices are in love; Injuries,

War, and peace again. If you desire to make these uncertain things
Certain by reason, you should do no more good,
Then if you should endeavor to be mad with reason.
And that which you now in your angry mood think with your self,

I would die rather: she shall know what a fellow I am.
Verily, one counterfeit tear, which she has with much ado wrung from her eyes
By rubbing them pitifully, will cool these words,
And you will accuse your self of your own accord, and suffer her


O abominable act!
I now perceive her to be an errant queen, and that I am a wretched man.
It irketh me that I had any thing to do with her, and I burn in love, and
wittingly and willingly
Being sensible and seeing it, I am undone, neither do I know what to do.

What should you do? but ransom your self being a Prisoner, for as little

And do not torment your self.

Do you persuade me so?

If you be wise:
And besides those troubles which love it self has
Do not you add more, and bear those patiently which it has,
But look where she is, the very destruction of our estate,


QUid igitur faciam? non eam? ne nunc quidem
Cum accersor ultro? an potius ita me comparem,
Non perpeti meretricum contumelias?
Exclusit, revocat, redeam? non si me obsecr^t.


Verum si incipies, neque perficies gnaviter,
Atque ubi pati non poteris, cum nemo expetet,
Infecta pace, ultro ad eam venies; indicans
Te amare, and far non posse, actum est, illicet,


Proin tu, dum est tempus, etiam atque etiam cogita.

Here, quae res in se neque consilium neque modum
Habet ullum, eam consilio regere non potes.
In amore haec omnia insunt vitia; injuriae,

Bellum, pax rursum. Incera haec si postules
Ratione cerca facere, nihilo plus agas,
Quam si des operam ut cum ratione insanias.
Et quod nunc tute tecum iratus cogitas,

Mori me malim; sentiet qui vir siem.
Haec verba una mehercule falsa lachrymula,
Quam oculos terendo misere vix vi expresserit,
Restinguet, and te ultro accusabis, and dabis


O indignum facinus! nunc ego
Et illam scelestam esse, and me miserum sentio.
Et taedet and amore ardeo, and prudens sciens,
Vivus vidensque pereo, nec quid agam, scio.

Quid agas? nisi ut te redimas captum quam queas

Et ne te afflictes.

Itane suades?

Si sapis,
Neque praeterquam quas ipse amor molestias habet,
Addas, and illas quas habet recte feras.
Sed ecca, ipsa egreditur nostri fundi calamitas;


AH me poor woman, I am afraid lest Phaedria
Should take that more heavily, or otherwise then I did it,
Because he was not admitted yesterday.

Parmeno,
I tremble every joint of me, I am in a fright since I saw her.

Have a good heart,


Who talks here? Alas, was it you here, my Phaedria?
Why stood you here? Why did you not come in straight?

But
Here is not a word of shutting out.

Why do you not speak?

Forsooth, because indeed these doors stand always open for me,


Let these complements pass.

What let them pass? O Thais, Thais, I wish I had
A like share of your love as you have of mine, and that it might come to pass
in like manner
That this might either grieve you, just as it does me;
Or that I could value that doing of yours as nothing.

Phaedria,
I did not do it truly therefore because I loved or affected any man more then
you
But so the case stood, it must needs be done.

I believe, as it fell out, the poor woman shut him out of doors for love.

Say you so Parmeno? Well go to: But hear for what cause


Be it so.

First ^elt me
This, can this man hold his peace?

What, I? very well:
But do you hear, I assure you faithfully on this condition;
What I hear that is true, I conceal, and keep in very well;
But if any thing be false, or forged, it is all abroad presently.

And therefore if you would have it concealed, speak what is true.

My mother was born at Samos, she dwelt at Rhodes.

This may be concealed.

Moreover a Merchant there
Gave my mother a little gire for a present,
Athens.

A Citizen, or no?

I think she was one,
I am not sure; she told us the name of her Mother and Father,
But her Country, and other marks she neither knew,
Nor indeed could she by reason of her age.
The Merchant told us this moreover, that he had heard

My mother as soon as she had her, began to teach her
All things carefully, and to bring her up so, as if she had been her daughter;
Most folks thought that she was my sister:
I went thence hither with that stranger, with whom alone I had to do,


Both these are false, out it goeeth.

How know you that?

Do you ask?
Because you was neither content with one, neither did alone give them:
For this man has also brought you a good, and a great share.

It is so; but let me come to my tales end, as I desire.

Went a journey into Caria; in the mean space
I became acquainted with you; you your self know after these things, how
tenderl
I loved you, and how I made you privy to all my counsels.

Parmeno will not conceal this.

Oh, is there any doubt of that?


But a while ago, her brother was somewhat covetous;
He, when he saw this maid to be of a lovely beauty,
And skilled on an instrument, hoping to get a sum of money,
Brought her out presently, and sold her; By mere fortune this friend of mine
Was there present; he bought her for a present for me,
Unwitting and ignorant of all these matters:
I came hither, and after he perceived that I had dealing with you too,
He made all the excuses he could, that he might not give me her.
He said, if he might be sure that he should be preferred with you
Before me, and might not fear, lest when I had got her,
I should forsake him, he could find in heart to bestow her on me,
But he was afraid of that. But as far as I can gather,
He has a mind to the maid.

Was there any more betwixt them?

Nothing; for I enquired: Now my Phaedria,
There are many reasons, why I should desire to get her from him:
First, Because she is reported to be my sister: and besides, that I may
Restore and deliver her to her friends. I am a lone woman, I have no body
here,
Neither friend, nor kindsman. Wherefore; my Phaedria,
I desirt to get me some friends by my good office;
I pray you help me about it, that it may be done more easily.
Give him leave to have the greater respect from me
For these few day^s. Do you make me no answer?

Thou naughty queen,
Should I answer you any thing with your such doings?

O brave Master of ours, I commend you. She is very sorry at last, you play the
man.

But I did not know what your speech tended to: There was a little girl
Stolen away hence, my mother brought her up for her own:
She is reported to be my sister: I desire to get her from him, that I may
restore her to her friends.
Forsooth all these words come to this; in short,
I am shut out, he is entertained. For what cause?
But that you love him better than me; i and you now fear that wench
Which is brought hither, lest she should get him such a man as he is from you.

Am I afraid of that?

What else then troubles you?
Tell me, does he alone give you gifts? did you ever find
My bounty to be restrained toward you?
Did not I, when you told me that you desired to have a little maid
From Aethiopia, leaving all my business,
Get you one? Besides you said, you desired to have an Eunuch,
Because none but great Ladies use such* I got you one*
I gave twenty pounds yesterday for them both.
For all this I am slighted by you. I have not forgot these things.
For these good turns I am scorned by you.

What is this you say, Phaedria?
Although I desire to get her away from him, and I suppose by this means
It may best of all be done, yet nevertheless
Rather then I should have your dis-favour, I will do as you would have me.

I would to God you spoke that word from your heart and really,
Rather then I should have your dis-favour, if I thought
It was sincerely spoken, I could away with any thing.

How soon does he begin to falter, being overcome with one word?

Do not I poor woman speak from my heart? what thing
Did you desire of me in jest, but you obtained at last*
Can not I obtain this of you, that you would but go aside
Two days only?

If it be but two days;
But let them not be made twenty days.

Truly not above two days, or --

O^ I matter not.

It shall not be, only let me entreat you this.

Yes forsooth,
I must do, what will you have me do.

I love you because you deserve it.

You do well.
I will go into the country, there will I pine my self this two days,
I am resolved to do it, I must satisfy Thais mind.
Do you, Parmeno, see they be brought hither.

Yes.

farewell for these two days.

My Phaedria,
Fare you well too; would you have any thing else?

Would I have any thing else?
I desire that you may be absent from the soldier, when you are present with
him,
That you would love me night and day, and long for me,
That you would dream on me, look for me, think on me,
Hope for me, delight your self with me, and be wholly with me.
Lastly, see that you be my sweetheart, for as much as
I am yours.

Woe is me poor woman, this man perhaps
Gives little credit to me, and now judges me by other women's dispositions,
But I indeed, who am privy to my self, am sure of this,
That I have not forged any lie, neither is any man
More dear to my heart then this Phaedria is.
And whatever I have done in this matter, I did it
For the maids sake; for I hope I have now in a manner
Found out her brother, a very noble young gentleman;

I will go in hence, and tarry looking for him till he come.

MIseram me! vereor ne illud gravius Phaedria
Tulerit, neve aliorsum, atquc ego feci, acceperit,
Quod heri intromissus non est.

Totus tremo
Parmeno, horr^^, postquam aspexi hanc.

Bono animo es.


Quis hic loquitur? Ehem, tun' hic eras, mi Phaedria!
Quid stabas hic? Cur non recte introibas?

Caeterum De exclusione verbum nullum.

Quid taces?

Sane quia vero hae mihi patent semper fores,


Missa istaec face.

Quid missa? O Thais, Thais, utinam esset mihi
Pars aequa amoris tecum: ac pariter fieret
Ut aut hoc tibi doleret, itidem ut mihi dolet;
Aut ego istuc abs te factnm nihili penderem.


Non pol quo quenquam plus amem, aut plus diligam
Eo feci: sed ita erat res; faciundum fuit.

Credo, ut fit, misera prae amore exclusit hunc for as.

Siccine ais, Parmeno? age; Sed, huc qua gratia


Fiat.

Dic mihi
Hoc primum, potin' est hic tacere?

Egone? optume,
Verum heus tu, lege hac tibi meam astringo fidem:
Quae vera audiv, taceo, and contineo optime;
Sin falsum, aut vanum, aut fictum est, cont^nuo palam est.

Proin tu taceri si vis, vera dicito.

Samia mihi matter fuit, ear habitabat Rhodi.

Potest taceri hoc.

Tum ibi matri parvulam
Puellam dono quidam mercator dedit,


Civemne?

Arbitror.
Certum non scimus: matris nomen and patris
Dic^bat ipsa: patriam and signa caecera
N^que sciebat, neque per aetatem etiam potuerat.
Mercator hoc addebat, e praedonibus

Matter ubi accepit, cepit studiose omnia
Docere, educare, ita ut si esset filia.
Sororem plerique esse credebant meam.
Ego cum illo, quocum tum uno rem habebam, hospite,


U^rumque hoc falsum est: efluit.

Qui istuc?

Rogas?
Quia neque uno eras content^, neque solus dedit:
Nam hic quoq bonam magnamque partem ad te attulit.

Ita st: sed sine me pervenire quo volo.

In Cariam profectus est: te interea loci
Cognovi tute scis post illa quam intimum
Te habeam, and mea consilia ut tibi credam omnia.

Ne hoc quidem ^ebit Parmeno.

Oh, dubiumne id est?


Nuper, ejus frater aliquantum ad rem est avidior;
Is ubi hanc forma videt honesta virginem,
Et fid^bus scire, pretium sperans, ill^co
Producit, vendit. Forte fortuna affuit
Hic meus amicus; emit eam dono mihi,
Imprudens harum rerum ignarusque omnium:
Is venit, postquam sensie me tecum quoque
Rem habere, fingit causas, ne det, sedulo.
Ait, si fidem habeat se iri praepositum tibi

Sese relinquam, velle sese mihi dare,
Verum id vereri; sed, ego quantum suspicor,
Ad virginem animum adjecit.

Etiamne amplius?

Nihil: nam quoesivi; Nunc ego eam, mi Phaedria,

Primum quod soror dicta est; praeterea ut suis
Restituam ac reddam. Sola sum, habeo hic neminem
Neque amicum neque cognatum: Quemobrem, mi Phaedria.
Cupio aliquos praeparare amicos beneficio meo.

Sine illum priores parts hosce aliquot dies
Apud me habere; nihil respondes?

Pessuma,
Egon' quicquam cum istis factis respondeam?

Heu noster, laudo. Tandem perdoluit: vir es.


Hinc est abrepta; eduxit matter pro sua:
Soror dicta est; cupio abducere ut reddam suis.
Nempe omnia haec verba huc redeunt denique,
Excludor ego, ille recipitur: qua gratia?

Quae advecta est, ne illum talem praeripiat tibi?

Egon' id timeo?

Quid ergo aliud sollicitat?
Cedo, number ille solus dona dat? nunc ubi meam
Benignitatem sensisti in te claudier?

Ancillulam, relictis rebus omnibus
Quaesivi? porro Eunuchum dixti velle te,
Quia solae utuntur his reginae; repperi.
Heri minas viginti pro ambobus dedi,

Ob haec facta abs te spernor.

Quid istuc, Phaedria?
Quanquam illam cupio abducere, atque hac re arbitror
Id fieri posse maxim, veruntamen
Potius quam te inimicum habeam, faciam ut jusseris.


POTIUS quam te inimicum habeam; si istuc crederem
Sincere dici, quidvis possem perpeti.

Labascit, victus uno verbo, quam cito?

Ego non ex animo misera dico? quam joco

Ego impetrare nequeo hoc abs te, biduum,
Saltem ut concedas solum.

Siquidem biduum
Verum ne fiant isti viginti dies.

Profecto non plus biduum, aut.

Aut? nihil moror.



Scilicet,
Faciundum est quod vis.

Merito te amo.

Been facis.
Rus ibo, ibi hoc me macerabo biduum,
Ita facere certum est, mos gerundus est Thaidi.
Tu, Parmeno, huc fac illi adducantur.

Maxume.



Mi Phadria,
Et tu, nunquid vis aliud?

Egone quid velim?
Cum milite isto praesens, absens ut sies,
Dies noctesque ames me, me desideres,
Me somnies: me expectes, de me cogites:

Meus fac sis postren o animus, quandoquidem
Ego sum tuus.

Me miseram, forsitan mihi hic
Parvam habeat fidem, atque ex aliarum ingeniis me nunc judicet.
Ego pol, quae mihi sum conscia, hoc certo scio,

Cordi esse quenquam chariorem hoc Phaedria,
Et quicquid hujus feci, causa virginis
Feci; nam me ejus fratrem spero propemodum
Jam repperisse, adolescentem adeo nobilem:

Concedam hinc intro: expectabo dum venit.

Do as I bade you, let those be brought away.

I will.

But diligently.

It shall be done.

But quickly.

It shall be done.

Have I not
Given you sufficient commands?

Do you go on to ask, as though i^ were such a hard matter?
Phaedria, I wish you could as easily get any thing,


I am like to be lost my self too, which is a thing more precious to me;
Do not you take that so impatiently.

No.
But would you have any thing else, and I will dispatch it for you?

Set out my present with words as well as you can, and thrust away
T^ copes-mate from her as far as you can.

I remember it, though


I will go into the country, and tarry there.

I think so.

But do you bear?

What would you have?

Do you think that I can
Settle my self, and abide, so as not to come back again in the mean time?

What you?
Truly I think not; for either you will return by and by, or your dreams after
a while
Will drive you hitherway.

I will do some work, until I be weary,


You will lie waking, when you are weary,
And then you will do this the rather.

Alas, Parmeno, you talk to no purpose truly;
This niceness of mind must be cast away. I pamper my self too much.
Can I not be without her, if need be, for three days together?

Whoo, whole three days? beware what you do.

I am resolved upon it.


By love, that you cannot know one to be the same he was? There was no man alive
Less given to folly, nor any one more stayed, or that could better bridle his
affections, than this man
But who is this that comes on hither? Ah, Ah, this indeed is Gnatho
The Soldiers Parafite; he brings with him a Virgin for a present to her. O
strange

With this decrepit Eunuch of mine* She surpasses Thai^ (...) self.

FAc ita ut jussi; deducantur isti.

Faciam.

At diligenter.

Fiet

Mature.

Fiet.

Satin' hoc
Mandatum est tibi?

Ah, rogitare? quasi difficile sit,
Utinam tam aliquid invenire facile possis Phaedria


Ego quoque una pereo, quod mihi est charius.
Ne istoc tam iniquo patiare animo.

Minime*
Sed nunquid aliud vis? quin effectum dabo.

Munus nostrum ornato verbis quoad poteris, and istum (...)
Quoad poteris ab ea pellito.

Memini, tametsi


Ego rus ibo, atque ibi manebo.

Censeo. Sed heus tu.

Quid vis?

Censen' posse (...)
Obfirmare and perpeti, ne redeam interea?

Tene? non hercle
Arbitror; nam aut jam reverte^, aut mox noctu te
Adigent horsum insomnia.

Opus faciam, ut defatiger use*


Vigilabis lassus, hoc plus
Facies.

Ah, nihil dicis, Parmeno, ejiciunda hercle
Haec est mollities animi: Nimis me indulgeo.
Tandem ego non illa caream, si sit opus, vel totum* triduum?

Hui universum triduum? vide quid agis.

Stat se^


Ex amore, ut non cognoscas eundem esse? hoc nemo fuit.
Minus ineptus, magis severus quisquam, nec magis continens.
Sed quis hic est, qui huc pergit? Atat, hic quidem parasitus Gnatho
Militis, ducit secum una virginem dono huic. Pape!

Cum meo decrepito hoc Eunucho: haec superat ipsam Thaidem.

O Wonderful! how much is one man more excellent to an another?
What odds there is
Betwixt a wise man and a fool? This came into my mind thus upon the occas^^n;
As I was coming hither to day, I met with one of my own rank
And condition, a man that was no niggard, who had consumed as (...) had done

Sickly, full of tatters and years: What apparel is this? quoth I,
Because* I poor man, have idly spent what I had; Alas, to what estate
Am I brought? All my acquaintance and friends forsake me.
Hereupon I scorned him in comparison of my self. what you, Idle fellow, quoth
I

Have you lost your wit with your estate? Do you not see me
Come from the same estate, what my color, neatness, clothing, and plight of
body is
I have all things, and yet have nothing: and though I have nothing, yet
I want nothing. But I poor man, can neither endure to be made a fool on,

You are far deceived. This sort of men made again of it in times past,
In the days of old: This is a new kind of bird-catching.
Besides, I first was he that invented this way: There is a sort of men
That would have themselves reputed the bravest in the world. I follow these.
I do not apply my self to these, that they may laugh at me, but I laugh at
them for the nonc^:
And withal, I wonder at their wits: what soever they say, I commend it; and
again
If they unsay it, I commend that too; if any one deny this or that, I deny it;
if he say it, I say it.
Lastly, I have such a command over my self, as to flatter them in every thing;
This is the greatest gain in the world now.

A pretty fellow inindeed!
He makes these men stark mad that were but fools before.

Whilst he and I talked thus, in the mean time, as we came into the shambles,
There came running, and glad to meet me, all the Comfit-makers, Fishmongers,
Butchers,
Cooks, Pudding-wrights, Fishermen, Fowlers, whom I had been beneficial to,
When I had my estate, and since I lost it, and yet do many good turns too;
they salute me, they invite me (...) supper,
They bid me welcome. When that poor hunger-starved fellow saw me
To be in so great repute, and that I got my living so easily, then
The man began to entreat me, that be might have leave to learn it of me:
I bade him follow me, if be could learn; that as the Sects of Philosophers
Have their names from them, so Parasites in like manner might be called
Gnathonicks.

Do you not see what idleness and other men's meat can do?

But I make small baste
To bring this maid to Tha is, and to entreat her to come to supper.
But I see Parmeno, the rivals servant, sad before Thais' s door:
All is well enough yet I forsooth men may stand and starve here.
I am resolved to play upon this knave.

These suppose Thais is theirs,
By this present.

Gnatho greeteth Parmeno his especial friend With many salutations, what are
you doing

I am standing.

I see that. But do you see any thing here which thou would not see?

I see you.

So I think. But see you nothing else?

Why so?

Because
You are sad.

Never a whit indeed.

Be not so. But do you think of
This slave?

She is no ill-favored one indeed.

I nettle the fellow.

How, you are quite deceived!

How weldome will this present be to Thais
Think thou?

This is as much as if you should say, that we are packt out hence;
But do you hear, There is an alteration of all things.

Parmeno,
I will set you at ease for these whole six months;
That you may not run to and fro, nor sit up till light day:
Do not I make you a happy man?

What me! whoo.

Thus I use to pleasure my friends.

I commend you.

I detain you, perhaps you had gone somwhither else
If I had not detained you,

No whither.

Then
Afford me a little of your help; cause that I may be admitted in to her.

Well, go on, these doors stand open for you, because you bring that maid.

Would you have any body called out hither?

Let but these two days
Be passed, and I will be sure to make you that are happy, to open me the doors
now with one little finger,
That you shall often kick against with your heels to no purpose.

Do you stand here yet, Parmeno? what are you left to be a Watchman,
Lest any Messenger should hap now to step privily from the Soldier to Thais?

Wittily spoken; Mavelous things they must be, that should please the
soldier.
But do not I see my Masters younger son coming hither?
I wonder why he went from Piraeum, for he is now to keep public watch there.
There is something in the matter, and comes hastily; he looks about him I know
not at what.

D^ immortales, ho^ ini homo quid praestat? stulto intelligens.

Qui esse primos se omnium rerum volunt: hos confector;

Ingenia admiror simul: quicquid dicunt, laudo: id rursum
Si negant, laudo id quoque; negat quis, nego; ait, aio:
Postremo imperavi egomet mihi omnia assentati.
Is questus nunc est multo uberrimus.

Scitum hercle


Dum haec loquimur, interea loci ad macellum ubi convenimus*
Concurrunt laeti mihi obviam, cupedinarii omnes, cetarii, lanii,
Coqui, fartores, piscatores, aucupes, quibus and re salva
Et perdita profueram, and pr^um saepe: salutant: ad coenam vocant:

Me esse tanto honor, and tam facile victum quaerere; ibi
Homo cepit me obsecrare, ut sibi liceret dicere id de me.
Sectari jussi, si potis est, tanquam Philosophorum habent disciplinae
Ex ipsis vocabula, parasiti itidem ut Gnathonici vocentur.



Sed ego cesso
Ad Thaidem hanc deducere, and rogare ad coenam ut veniat;
Sed Parmenonem ante ostium Thaidis tristem video,
Rivalis servum: salva res: nimirum hic homines frigent.
Nebulonem hunc certum est eludere.

Hioe hoc munere


Plurima salute
P^^menonem summum suum impertit Gnatho. Quid agitur (...)

Statur.

Video. Numquidnam hic quod nolis vides?

Te.

Credo. At nunquid aliud?

Quia
Tristis es.

Nihil quidem.

Ne sis. Sed quid videtur


Non malum hercle.

Uro hominem.

Ut falsus animo es!

Quam hoc munus gratum Thaidi
Arbirrare esse?

Hoc nunc dices, ejectos hinc nos.
Omnium rerum, heus tu, vicissitudo est

Sex ego te
Totos, Parmeno, hos menses quietum reddam:

Ecquid be te?

Mean? pape.

^Sic soleo amicos.

Laudo.

Detineo te fortasse; tu profectus alio fueras,
Si te non detinuissem.

Nusquam.

Tun' igitur
Paululum da mihi operae, fac ut admittar ad illam:



Number quem evocari huc vis for as?

Sine biduum hoc
Pretereat, qui mihi nunc uno digitulo aperis fores fortunatus,
Ne tu istas faxo calcibus saepe insultabis frustra.

Etiam nunc hic stas, Parmeno? Eho, inumnam relictus custos,


Facete dictum. Mira vero militi quae placeant.
Sed videon' herilem filium minorem huc advenire?
Mir^^ quid ex Piraeo abierit; nam ibi custos public est nunc.
Non temere est, and properans venit: nescio quid circumspectat.

I Am undone, the maid is nowhere to be found; and I am lost too, that lost her
Out of my sight. Where should I seek her? where should I look after her? whom
should I ask for her
What way should I tak? I am uncertain: yet this is my only hope,
Wherever she is, she cannot be long concealed. O beautiful face! I will

These common ordinary beauties.

But look you where the other brother is,
He talks something of love.

O this unfortunate old man!

This is he indeed,
Who if he begin to love, you will say his other brother was but a sport and a
jest
In comparison of these things which his mad fit will afford.

I wish

And me too, because I stood still, and did not set him light. But look where
Parmeno is, God save you

Why are you so sad? why are you not merry? whence come you?

Truly I do not know either whence I come, nor whither I go, I have so utterly


How, I pray you?

I am in love.

How now?

Now, Parmeno,
Show your self what an honest man you are; you know you often promised me,
saying, Chaerea
Do but find out one that you can love, and I will let you know how far
I am able to pleasure you in that matter; when I give thee all my Fathers
provisio
Into thy cock-loft privately.

Go on, you fool.

Truly this was done:


If so be the thing
Be worthy that one should bestow pains about it.

The maid is not like
Our ordinary Lasses, whom the mothers strive that they may have their shoulders
Down, and have their bodies laced, that they may be slender. If so be
One be a little grosser, they say she is a Champion, they abridge them of
their diet


What a one was thine?

Such a feature of a face is seldom seen.

Wh^o.

Her
Color is natural, her body is sound, and full of good blood.

Of what years is she?

Sixteen*

The very prime of her age.

See thou procure me her, either by force, or by privy stealth, or by love for
a while
It makes no matter to me, so I may but have her.

What whose maid is she?



Whence is she?

I can tell you just as much.

Where dwells she?

I cannot tell that neither. Where lost you her?

In the way.

How
Came you to lose her?

Truly as I came I was now angry at my self for that,
Neither do I think there is any man to whom all good fortunes.
Fall out more* cross.

What villainy is this?

I am undone.

What is done?

Archimedes a kinsman of my faand of his age?
Why should I not?

He, as I was following the maid, met me. Truly it was inconveniently.

Nay indeed unluckily, for other things may be accounted inconveniences.
I may safely swear I had not seen him at all these six or seven months
Last post, but just now, when I had least mind to see him, and when I h^^ no
need


Yes.

He presently came running to me, a great way off, being crooked,
^rembling, with his lips hanging down, groaning; Ho, h^, I speak to you?
Chaerea, says he, I stood still. Wot you what I would have with you? Tell me;
To morro
I must have a trial. What then? I would have you be sure to tell your father,
that be ma
Remember to be of my counsel betimes in the morning. He was an hour telling
this

When I looked this way toward the maid, she fairly had turned in the mean
whil
Into this street of ours.

It is a wonder if he do not speak of this maid which
Was given erewhile for a present to Thais.

When I came hither, here was no maid;

Did any company follow the maid?

Yes, a Parasite


It is even she. Say no more; the matter is now at a point.

You mind other things.

Truly I mind this.

Do you know who she is? tell me,
Or have you seen her?

I have seen her, and know her.

And wot you where she is?

She is brought hither to Thais the whore, and is given her for a present.

Who


Thraso the soldier,
Phaedria's corrival.

You tell me my brother has a hard game to play.

Yes,
Indeed if you knew but what a gift he has provided on the other side to match
with this
Then you would say so the rather.

What I pray you, in good sooth?

An Eunuch.

That
Ill-favored fellow I pray you, whom he bought yesterday, that old man,


That very same.

Certainly the man will be
Thrust out of doors with his gift. But I did not know that that Thais was our
neighbor

She has not been long so.

I am undone. That I should never have seen her yet.
Come tell me, is she as handsome as she is reported to be?

Yes.

But
She is not to be compared to this of mine.

That is another matter.

I pray thee in earnest
Parmeno, see to it, that may obtain her.

I will do the best I can, and will do my endeavor,
I will help you; would you have me do more?

Why do you go home now?

That I may bring these slaves to Thais, so as your brother bade me.

O that happy Eunuch, that is to be bestowed into this house!

Why so?

Do you ask? He shall alwayet behold his fellowservant at home

In one house; he shall sometimes take his victuals with her; he shall sometimes
Sleep by her side.

What if you your self now should be made the happy man?

How,
Parmeno? answer me.

You moy take his clothes.

His clothes?
What then must I do afterward?

I will bring you in his stead.

I hear you.



I understand you.

You may enjoy those commodities
Which you said erewhile he was like to enjoy. You may diet with her, you may
by her touch her
Dally with her, and sleep by her side: forasmuch as none of them
Knows you, nor can they tell who you are. Besides your countenance and age
is such
As you may easily prove your self to be the Eunuch.

You have said well, I never knew

As fast as you can.

What do you mean? truly I did but jest.

You prate.

I am undone: what have I done poor wretch? whether do you thrust me? you will
throw me over by and by
Truly I read you, tarry.

Let us go.

Do you go on.

I am resolved.

Have a care this be not too rash a resolution now.

Truly it is not: Let me do it.



Is it
A villainous act, i^ I be brought into a bawdy house, and now come even with
Those whores, which contemn our young years, and continually torment us every
way
And beguile them so as they have beguiled us;
Or rather, is it fit I should put up these things? It is but just that I should

Every body will think it was well done.

What is that; if you be resolved to do it, do it.
But do not lay the blame on me afterward.

I will not*

Do you bid me do it?

I bid you; noy, I charge and command you.

I will never resist
Your authority. Follow me.

God speed us well.

OCcidi. Neque vergo est usquam, neque ego, qui illam e conspectu
Amisi meo: ubi quaeram? ubi investigem? quem perconter?
Quam insistam viam? incertus sum. Una haec spes est,
Ubi ubi est, diu celari non potest. O faciem pulchram! dele^

Harum formarum.

Ecce autem alterum, nescio quid
De amore loquitur.

O infortunatum senem!

Hic vero est,
Qui si occeperit amare, ludum jocumque dices fuisse illum
Alterum, praeut hujus rabies quae dabit.

Ut illum

Meque adeo, qui rest* terim; tum autem qui illum non
Flocci fecerim. Sed eccum Parmenonem, Salve.

Quid tu es tristis? quid ve es alacris? unde is?

Ego nescio hercle, neque unde eam, neque quorsum eam, ita prorsus


Qui quaeso?

Amo.

Hem.

Nunc, Parmeno,
Te ostendes qui vir sies; scis te mihi saepe pollicitum esse: Chaere^,
Al^quid inveni modo quod ames; in ea re utilitatem ego faciam
Ut cognoscas meam; cum in cellulam ad te patris penum omnem
Congerebam clanculum.

Age, inepte:

Hoc hercle


Adeo est
Digna res ubi nervos intendas tuos.

Haud similis
Virgo est virginum nostrarum; quas matres student devinctis
Humeris esse, vincto corpore, ut graciles sient. Siquidem
Habitior paulo, pugilem esse a^unt, deducunt cibum; tametsi


Quid tua istaec?

Nova figura oris.

Pape.

Color.
Verus. Corpus solidum, and succi plenum.

Anni.

Sedecim.

Flos
Ipse.

Hanc tu mihi vel vi, vel clam, vel precario fac tradas,
Mihi nihil refert, dum potiar modo.

Quid, virga cuja est?



Unde est?

Tantundem.

Ubi habitat?

Ne id quidem.

Ubi amisisti?

In via.

Qua ratione
Amisisti?

Id quidem adveniens mecum ^tomachabar modo;
Neque quenquam hominem esse arbitror, cui magis bonae faelicitates
Adversae sient.

Quid hoc est sceleris?

Perii.

Quid factum est?



Quidni?

Is dum sequar, fit mihi obviam*

Incommode herele.

Immo enimvero infoeliciter. Nam incommoda alia sunt dicenda
Illum, liquet mihi dejerare, his mensibus sex vel septem prorsum non
Vidisse proximis, nisi nunc, cum minime vellem minimeque opus fuit.


Maxume.

Continuo accurrit ad me, quam long quidem incurvus,
Tremulus, labi^s demissis, gemens; Heus, heus, tibi dico,
Chaerea, inquit; restiti: scin' quid ego te volebam? Dic cras;
Est mihi judicium; quid tum? ut diligenter nuncies patri, advocatus

Rogo numquid velit. Recte, inquit, abeo. Cum huc respicio
Ad virginem, illa sese interea commodum huc verterat
In hanc nostram plateam.

Mirum ni hanc dicit, modo huic
Quae data est dono.

Huc cum advenio, nulla erat.



Verum parasitus
Cum ancilla.

Ipsa est. Desine, jam conclamatum est.

Alias
Res agis.

Istuc equidem ago.

Nostin' quae sit? dic mihi
Aut vidist in'?

Vidi, novi.

Et scis ubi sict?

Huc
Deducta est ad Thaidem meretricem, ei dono datur.

Quis


Miles Thraso,
Phaedriae rivalis.

Duras parts fratris praedicas.

Immo
Enim si scias quod donum huic dono contra comparet, tum magis
Id dicas.

Quidnam, quaeso, hercle.

Eunuchum.

Illumne?
Obsecro inhonestum hominem, quem mercatus est heri, senem,


Istunc ipsum.

Homo quatietur certe
Cum dono for as. Sed istam Thaidem non scivi nobis vicinam:

Haud diu est.

Perii. Nunquamne etiam me illam vidisse.
Ehodum dic mihi, estne ut fertur, forma?

Sane.

At
Nihil ad nostram hanc.

Alia res est.

Obsecro hercle.
Parmeno, Fac ut potiar.

Faciam sedulo, ac dabo operam,
Adjuvabo, nunquid me aliud vis?

Quid nunc is domum?

Ut mancipia haec, ita ut jussit frater, ducam ad Thaidem.

O Fortunatum istum Eunuchum, qui quidem in hanc detur
Domum!

Quid ita?

Rogitas? Summa forma semper

In unis aedibus: cibum nonnunquam capiet cum ea; interdum
Propter dormiet.

Quid si nunc tute fortunatus fias?

Qua re
Parmeno? responde.

Capias tu vestem illius.

Vestem?
Quid tum postea?

Pro illo te deducam

Audio.

Te illum


Intelligo.

Tu illis fruare commodis, quibus
Tu illum dicebas modo. Cibum una capias, adsis, tangas, ludas,
Propter dormias: quandoquidam neque illarum te quisquam
Novit, neque scit qui sies; praeterea forma and aetas ipsa est, facile
Ut pro Eunucho probes.

Dixti pulchre, nunquam vidi melius

Quantum potes.

Quid agis? Jocabar equidem.

Garris.

Perii, quid ego egi miser? quo trudis? perculeris jam tu me?
Tibi equidem dico, mane.

Eamus.

Pergin'?

Certum est.

Vide ne nimium callidum hoc sit modo.

Non est profecto. Sine.



An id
Flagitium est, si in domum meretriciam deducar, and illis crucibus,
Quae nos nostramque adolescentiam habent despicatam, and quae nos
Semper omnibus cruciant modis, nunc referam gratiam atque ^tidem fallam,
Ut ab illis fallimur? an potius haec pati? aequum est fieri ut a me

Factum omnes putent.

Quid istuc? si certum est facere, facias.
Verum ne post conferas culpam in me.

Nonfaciam.

Jubesne?

Jubeo; immo cogo atque impero.

Nunquam defugiam
Authoritatem. Sequere.

Dii vortant been.

ANd did Thais give me great thanks?

Huge ones.

Say you so!
Is she glad?

Not so much indeed for the gift it self, as for that you bestowed it:
Indeed she heartily rejoices at that.

I come hither to see, that when time serves
I may bring my present; But see where the Soldier is.

Truly I have that gift,


Indeed I have observed so much.

Even the King gave me always great thanks for what I did; but he did not so
to others

He often times by words trasfers the great honor upon himself, which was got
By other men's pains; who has the wit that you have?

You have it right.

Therefore the King had you in repute.

Yes indeed.

To delight himself with you.

Yes;
And to commit all his army and his counsels to me.

This is a wonder.

And besides,
If at any time he grew weary of men's company, or was tired with business,
When he would take his ease, as though: do you not know my meaning?

I know it.
As though when he would ease his mind of that trouble.

You hit it.
Then had he to be his guest.

^hoo, you tell me of a fine king indeed.



Nay,
I think there are none like him, if he keep you company.

They all envied me,
And spoke ill of me behind my back: I cared not a button; they spited me
pitifully
But one of them very greatly, whom he had made master of his Indian Elephants,
When he began to be more trouble some then others; I pray you, you Yeoman of
the stirrup, (quoth I) are you so ^ickish


Truly, it was well and wisely
Spoken: Whoo! You stifled the fellow. What said he?

He was presently
Mute.

What should he but be so?

O strange* That vile rascal,
And wretch, and that errand thief.

What Gnatho, did I never tell you that,
How I handled the young man of Rhodes at a feast.

Never. But


This same
Young man of Rhodes, which I speak of, was with me at a feast: By chan^,
I had a whore, he began to jeer at that, and to scoff me. What say you,
You shameless fellow said I? You are a Hare your self, and look for a dain^y
bit

Ha, ha, he.

What is the matter?

Wittily, dai^tily, finely said, nothing surpasses it.


Had you heard it?

Many times; and it is reported for a choice one.

It is mine own.

I am sorry that it was
Spoken to an undiscreet young man, and one that is a Gentleman.

But a mischief light on thee.

What said he, I pray you?

He was quasht: All that were by, were ready to die with laughing. To be short,
they were all afraid of me

Not without cause.

But do you hear, had I not best clear my self to Thais concerning the maid,


By no means: Nay rather
Increase her suspicion.

Why?

Do you ask? Do you not know, if she at any time
Make mention of Phaedria, or if she commend him, that she may nettle you
soundly

I think so.

To prevent that, there is no remedy but this; when she
Shall name Phaedria, do you presently name Pamphilus: If she shall at any time
Phaedria to feast it with us; do you say, let us encourage
Pamphila to sing; if she shall commend his beauty,
Do you on the contrary commend hers. To be short, give her quid for quo,
Which may vex her at the heart.

If she loved me, Gnatho, then that might do some good.

Forasmuch as she desires and loves what you give, she ere this

Lest you in your angry fit should bestow elsewhere the commodity which she
Now gets by you.

You say well; but that never entered into my thoughts.

It is fondly done; for you did not consider of it: But, Thraso, how much better
Might you have found out this same thing your self?

MAgnas vero agere gratias Thais mihi?

Ingentes.

Ain' tu?
Laetatur?

Non tam ipso quidem dono, quam abs te datum esse:
Id vero serio triumphat.

Huc proviso, ut ibi tempus siet,
Deducam; sed eccum ^^l^tem.

Est istuc datum profecto,


Advorti hercle animum.

Vel rex semper maxumas mihi agebat, quicquid feceram, aliis non item.

Labor alieno magnam partam gloriam verbis saepe in se
Transmovet, qui habet salem qui in te est.

Hui, regem elegantem.


Imo. sic homo est perpaucorum hominum.

Imo,
Nullorum arbitror, si tecum vivit.

Mordere clanculum: ego flocci pendere: illi invid ere misere.

Quid ni esset?

Dii vostram fidem! Hominem perditum,
Miserum and illum sacrilegum.

Quid illud, Gnatho, quo pacto
Rhodium tetigerim in convivio, nunquam dixi tibi?

Nunquam. Sed


Una in
Convivio erat hic, quem dico, Rhodius adolescentulus. Forte
Habui scortum, cepit ad id ludere, and me irridere. Quid ais,
Homo, inquam impudens? Lepus tute es, and pulpamentum quaeris.

Ha, ha, he.

Quid est?

Facete, laute, lepide, nihil supra.


Audieras?

Saepe and fertur in primis.

Meum est.

Doler dictum imprudenti
Adolescenti and libero.

At te dii perdant.

Quid ille quaeso?

Perditus. Risu omnes, qui aderant, emori. Denique, omnes metuebant.

Non injuria.

Sed heus tu, pergon' ego me de istac Thaidi,


Nihil minus. Imo, auge
Magis suspicionem.

Cur?

Rogas? sin'? siquando illa
Mentionem Phaedriae facit, aut si laudat, te ut male urat.

Sentio.

Id ne fiat, haec res sola est remedio, ubi
Nominabit Phaedriam, tu Pamphilam continuo. Siquando

Cantatum provocemus. Si laudabit haec illius formam,
Tu hujus contra. Denique par pro pari referto, quod eam
Mordeat.

Siquidem me amaret, tum istuc prodesset Gnatho.

Quando illud, quod tu das, expectat atque amat, jamdudum

Quem ipsa nunc capit fructum, ne quando iratus tu alio
Conferas.

Been dixisti: at mihi istuc non in mentem venerat.

Ridiculum! non enim cogitaras* caeterum idem tute melius
Q^anto invenisses, Thraso!

ME thought, I heard the Soldiers voice
Even now: and look where he is! God save you, my Thraso.

O my Thais,
Mine own sweetheart, how is it with you? Do you love me ere a whit
For that singing wench?

How handsomely does he complement! what a beginning has he made at his coming!



Let us go then to supper, Why stay you?

Behold the other! he would say he was spit out of that man's mouth.

When you will;
I will make no stay.

I will go to them, and make as though I came but now forth.
Thais, Are you going any whither?

O Parmeno, It is well done
Truly of you: I am going to day.

Whither?

What? Do you not see this man?

Phaedria.

Why stand we still? Why go we not hence?

I pray you forsooth, that we may
By your good leave, give this Gentlewoman what we desire; and that we may
Have liberty to come and speak to her.

I think, they are very goodly gifts, not like mine.

The deed will make mention. Do you hear; bid those come forth adores quickly,
whom I commanded to be brought out
Aethiopia.

Here are three pounds.

Scarce.

Where are you Dorus? come hither: Look you where an Eunuch is,
Of what a lovely countenance, of what a perfect age!

I swear
He is a comely person.

What say you, Gnatho? Do you find any thing, that you can dislike in him?
And what say you Thraso? they hold their tongues: they commend him
sufficiently. Make trial of hi

To be skillful in those things, which it is fitting for a young Gentleman to
know. And he that sent these things, does not desire yo
To live with him alone, and that others shon^ shut out for his sake; nor does
he tell o
His fights, nor brag of his marks of honor: nor does he hinder you, which
Some body does; but he thinks it sufficient, if he be then entertained,


It seems
This fellow is a servant to some poor and beggarly Master.

For indeed I am sure,
No body could abide to have this fellow, that has wherewithal to get another.

Hold you your tongue,
Whom I think to be the basest rascal in the world: for thou that can find in
thy hear
To flatter this fellow, wilt not stick, I suppose, to do any thing


Shall we now go?

I will first bring these in,
And withal give order what things I would have done; afterward I will come
forth presently

I will be gone hence. Do you tarry for her.

It is not fit for a Commander
To go with his sweetheart along the way.

What should I use many words to thee?
You are like your Master.

Ha, ha, he.

What do you laugh at?

That which you said
Rhodian comes into my mind. But Thais comes forth.

Go thy way, step before, that things may be got ready at home.

It shall be done.

Pythias, see you look diligently to it; that if Chremes chance to come hither,
You entreat him first to tarry; if that cannot conveniently be done, to come
again
If he cannot do that, bring him to me.

I will do so.


See that you keep home.

Let us go.

Do you come after me (maids.)

AUdire vocem modo militis
Visa sum: atque eccum. Salve mi Thraso.

O Thais mea,
Meum suavium, quid agitur? Ecquid nos amas de fidicina
Istac?

Quam venuste! quod dedit principium adveniens!



Eamus ergo ad caenam. Quid stas?

Hem alterum: ex homine hunc natum dicas.

Ubi vis,
Non moror.

Adibo atque adsimulabo, quasi nunc exeam.
Ituran' Thais quopiam es?

Hem Parmeno, Been pol
Fecisti: hodie itura.

Quo?

Quid? hunc non vides?



Quid stamus? Cur non imus hinc?

Quaeso hercle ut liceat,
Pace quod fiat tua, dare huic quae volumus: Convenire
Et colloqui.

Perpulcra credo dona, haud nostris similia.

Res indicabit. Heus, jubete isto, for as quos jussi ocyus.


Hic sunc tres
Minae.

Vix.

Ubi tu es, Door: accede huc. Hem Eunuchum,
Quam liberali facie, quam aetate integra!

Ita me dii ament,
Honestus.

Quid tu ais, Gnatho? nunquid habes quod contemnas?
Quid tu autem Thraso? Tacent: Satis laudabant: fac periculum

Aequum est adolescentem, solertem dabo. Atque haec qui misit non sibi soli
postula
Te vivere, and sua causa excludi caeteros, neque pugnas
Narrat, neque cicatrices suas ostentat: neque tibi obstat, quod
Quidam facit: verum ubi molestum non erit, ubi tu voles, ubi


Apparet servum hunc
Esse domini pauperis, miserique.

Non hercle nemo posset, sat
Scio, qui habet, qui pararet alium, hunc perpeti.

Tace tu
Quem ego esse infra infimos omnes puto homines; nam qui
Huic animum assentari duxeris, e flamma te cibum


Jamne imus?

Hos prius introducam,
Et quae volo simul imperabo: postea, continuo exeo.

Ego hinc abeo. Tu istam opperire.

Non convenit una ire
Cum amica imperatorem in via.

Quid tibi ego dicam multa?
Domini similis es.

Ha, ha, he.

Quid rides?

Istuc quod dixti


Abi, praecurre, ut sint domi parata.

Fiet.

Diligenter,
Pythias, fac ut cures, si Chremes huc forte advenerit,
Ut ores, primum ut maneat: si id non commodum est, ut redeat:
Si id non poterit, ad me adducito.

Ita faciam.


Virginem; domi adsitis, facite.

Eamus.

Vos me sequemini.

TRuly the more and more I consider it, without doubt this Thais will do me
Some great mischief, I see I am so cunningly destroyed by her.
Even then when she first bade I should be sent for to her house, (one may ask,
What had you to do with her? Truly I do not know) when I came, she found

With me about some serious business. I had then a suspicion that all these
thing
Were done in knavery: She sat down by me, she offered her self to to me;
She sought occasion of discourse: When she had little to say, she came to
this, as to enquire of me how long ag
It was since my father and mother died; I told her it was a long while ago.
Sunium, and how far it lay from the sea? I think,
This likes her well; she hopes she can get it from me. Lastly, she asked me,
whether I ha
Ever a little sister lost from thence? whether any body was lost with her? and
what she ha
When she was lost? and whether any body could know her? why should she ask
these things
Unless perhaps she feigneth that she is that little sister of mine which was
lost long ago

And no more. Thais is a gooddeal ^lder then I am;
Besides she sent to entreat me, that I would come to her. Let her tell me in
good earnes
What she would with me, or let her not trouble me. I will not come the third
time, Ho, ho

Who is there?

Its I Chremes.

O most pretty,


I say, I am like to be trepand.

Thais
Did most earnestly entreat you, that you would come again to morrow.

I am going into the country.

I beseech you do it.

I say, I cannot.

But do you tarry then
Here at our house, till she come again.

By no means.

Why, my Chremes?

Get thee hence with a mischief.

If you be so


I go then.

Go your way Dorias, bring this man quickly to the soldiers.

PRofecto quanto magis, magisque cogito, nimirum dabit Thais
Mihi magnum malum: Ita me ab ea astute video labefactarier.
Jam tum cum primu n jussit me ad sese accersier domum: (roget
Quis, Quid tibi cum ea? ne noram quidem) ubiveni, causam,

Velle agere mecum. Jam tum erat suspicio dolo malo haec
Fieri omnia. Ipsa accumbere mecum, mihi sese dare,
Sermonem quaerere. Ubi friget, huc evasit; Quam pridem
Pater mihi and matter mortui essent: dico, jam diu. Rus Sunii

Hoc: sperat se a me avellere. Post^emo, ecqua inde parva
Perisset soror? ecquis cum ea una; and quid habuisset,
Cu n periit? ecquis eam posset noscere? haec cur quaereret
Nisi si illa forte, quae olim periit parvula soror, hanc se

Nata est sedecim, non major. Thais, ego quam sum, majuscula est.
Misit porro orare, ut venirem. Serio aut dicat quid vult,
Aut molesta ne siet. Non hercle veniam tert o. Heus, heus,

Ecquis hic est?

Ego sum Chremes.

O capitulum


Dico ego mihi insidias fieri.

Thais
Maxumo te orabat operc, ut cras redires.

Rus eo.

Fac amabo.

Non possum inquam.

At tu apud
Nos hic mane, dum redeat ipsa.

Nihil minus.

Cur mi Chremes?

Malam rem! hinc abi.

Si istuc


Eo.

Abi, o Dorias, cito hunc deduc ad militem.

I Swear, as far forth as I see by the soldier, I poor woman
Do somewhat fear, lest that mad fellow should make any bustle to day,
Or offer violence to Thais. For after Chremes the young man
The maids brother came, she entreated the soldier to give order

Moreover Thais was urgent upon him to invite the man; that she did
To stay Chremes there, because she had had no time for that matter
Which she desired to tell him concerning his sister. He inviteth him with a
heavy heart
He tarried there, she begins to talk with him. Now the Soldier thought

He endeavored to do what he could to cross her. Ho boy, says he, call me
Pamphila
That she may make us m^rry here. She cries out, By no means
Admit her to the banquet: The soldier fell from that to chiding.
In the mean time the woman strips her self of her gold, and gives it me to
carry away


ITa me Dii been ament, quantum ego illum vidi, non
Nihil timeo misera, ne quam ille hcdie insanus turbam
Faciat aut vim Thaidi. Nam postquam advenit Chremes
Adolescens frater virginis, militem rogat ut eum admitti

Thais porro instare ut hominem invitet; id faciebat
Retinendi illius causa, quia, illa quae cupiebat de sorore
Ejus indicare, ad eam rem tempus non erat. Invitat tristis;
Mansit ibi; illa cum illo sermonem incipit; miles vero sibi

Huic contra aegre! Heus, inquit, puer, Pamphilam accerse,
Ut delectet hic nos: illa exclamnt; minime gentium
In convivium illam: miles tendere inde ad jurgium;
Interea au^um sibi clam mul^er demit; dat mihi ut auferam:


AS I was going into the country, I began (as it falls out when
Any trouble is in ones mind) to consider one thing after another,
And to construe them all to the worst sense: What needs many words?
Whilst I mused upon these things, I went unawares beyond my house. I was gone

When I came to the turn, I stood still, and began to think with my self;
What now, must I tarry here alone two days without her?
What then will be next? It is nothing. What? nothing? If I may not have leave
To touch her, why, shall I not have leave so much as to see her? If I may not
do that

I willingly pass by my country house. But what is the matter,
That Pythias goes out of doors so fearful on a sudden?

DUm rus eo, coepi egomet mecum inter vias, (ita ut fit ubi
Quid in animo est molestiae) aliam rem ex alia cogitare,
Et ea omnia in pejorem partem. Quid opus est verbis?
Dum haec reputo, praeterii imprudens villam. Long jam

Ubi ad ipsum veni d^ verticulum, constiti; occepi mecum
Cogitare, hem, biduum hic manendum est soli sine illa?
Quid tum postea? nihil est; quid? nihil? si non tangendi
Copia est, eho, ne videndi quidem erit? si illud non licet,

Nihil est. Villam praetereo sciens. Sed quid hoc est,
Quod timida subito egreditur Pythias?

WHere shall I poor woman find that wicked and ungracious fellow?
Or where shall I seek for him? That he should dare to commit
This so bold a prank!

I am afraid what this should be.

Moreover
And besides the rogue, after he had befooled the maid, he pitifully tare


What now?

Who if he were but now offered
Me, how willingly could I claw out the eyes of that wizard!

I know not indeed what a stir has been made at home, whilst I was away, I
will go to her
What is the matter? why do you make such haste, or whom do you look for,
Pythias

Ah Phaedria! whom do I look for? get you hence whither you deserve to go with
Such unpleasant gifts of yours.

What is the matter?

Do you ask
Me? what a stir that Eunuch which you gave us has made? He has defloured
The maid which the Soldier gave my Mistress for a present.

What say you?

I am undone.

You are drunk.

I wish they were so, that
Wish me ill.

Alas! I pray you, my Pythias, What strange thing
Was that?

You are mad, how could an Eunuch do that?

I know him not, who he was, but the thing it self evidenceth
This that he has done: The maid her self weepeth, neither dare she
Tell you, when you ask her, what the matter is: and that honest man is not to
be seen.
Besides, I poor woman suspect this, that he stole away something out of the
house
When he went away.

I cannot sufficiently marvail, whether that idle fellow
Could go far off, unless perhaps he be gone home again to ^ur house.

I pray you, go see, whether he be, or not.

I will let you know presently.

I am undone!
I pray you, my dear-heart, I never so much as heard of such an a^ominable
trick.

But indeed I had heard that they are the greatest lovers of women in the
world,
But that they can do nothing: but it never came into my mind, poor woman:
For I should have shut him up somewhere, and not have committed the maid to
him.

UBi ego illum scelerosum misera atque impium inveniam?
Aut ubi quaeram? Hoccine tam audax facinus facere
Esse ausum?

Hoc quid sit, vereor.

Quin
Etiam insuper scelus, post quam ludificatus est virginem, vestem


Hem?

Qui si nunc si detur
Mihi, ut ego unguibus facile illi in oculos involem venefico!

Nescio quid profecto absente nobis turbatum est domi: adibo
Quid istuc? quid festinas? aut quem quaeris, Pythias?

Hem Phaedria, egon' quem quaeram, abi hinc quo dignus cum


Quid istuc est rei?

Rogas
Me? Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas dedit? Virginem
Quam herae dono dederat miles, vitiavit.

Quid ais?

Perii.

Temulenta es.

Utinam sic sient, qui mihi
Male volunt.

Au, obsecro mea Pythias, quid istucnam


Insanis, qui i^tuc facere Eunuchus
Potuit?

Ego illum nescio qui fuerit; hoc quod fecit
Res ipsa indicat. Virgo ipsa lachrumat, neque cum rogites,
Quid sit, audet dicere. Illa autem bonus vir nusquam apparet.
Etiam hoc misera suspicor, aliquid domo abeuntem


Nequeo mi^ari satis, quo ille abire
Ignavus posset long us: nisi domum forte ad nos rediit.

Vise, amabo, number sit.

Jam faxo scies.

Perii,
Obsecro, tam infandum facinus, mea tu, ne audivi quidem.

At pol ego amatores audieram mulierum esse eas maxumos,

Nam illum aliquo conclusissem, neque illi commisissem virginem.

COme out of doors, you rogue; but do you sneak back indeed? you
runnagate-rogue, come out.
Yau that are ill bought.

I beseech you.

Oh, see what a wry mouth
The hangman makes! Why came you back hither again?
Why are your clothes changed? what say you? If I had ta^ried never so little
^onger,
I should not have found him at home, he had made himself so ready to run away.

Have you the sellow, I pray you?

What else should I but have him?

O well done!

This is very well done indeed.

Where is he?

Do you ask? do you not see him?

Whom I pray you, should I see?

This fellow
Forsooth.

What fellow is this?

He that was brought
To you to day.

None of us ever saw this fellow
With our eyes, Phaedria.

Did none of you see him?

I pray, did you believe
That this was the fellow that was brought to us?

For whom else should I believe
To be he? I had no body else.

Fi^, this fellow is not ta be compared
To him; he had an handsome face, and well-favoured.

So he seemed to you er^-while, because he was ^lad in a changeable suit;
Now you think him to be ugly, because he has not that on.

I pray you hold your peace; as if indeed there was but a very little
difference betwixt them.
There was brought to our house to day a young youth, whom you, Phaedria,
Would indeed be glad to see: but this is a wizz^nd, old, d^ousie, aged fellow,
As tawnie as a we sil.

How now, what a tale is this? you bring me to this print,
That I know not what I have done. Ho you sirrah, did not I buy you?

You bought me.

Bid him answer me again.

Ask him.

Did you come to our house to day? be says no: But that other came
Being about sixteen years old, whom Parmeno brought with him.

Come on,
Now tell me this first, whence had you that sull which you have?
You ugly fellow, will you tell me, or no?

Chaerea came.

My brother?

Yes.

When?

To day.

How long ago?

Just now.

With whom?

With Parmeno.

Did you know him before?

No.


How then?
Did you know that he was my brother?

Parmeno said
That it was he, he gave me this suit.

I am undone.

He put on mine himself, afterward they went both together out of doors.

Do you now sufficiently believe that I am not drunk, and that I have told no
lie


Go to now
You great beast, do you believe this fellow what he says?

What should I believe him for?
The deed hears mention.

Go aside thither a little.
Do you hear? ay but a very little, that is enough: Tell me now this again:
Did Chaerea pull off thy clothes from thee?

He did so.



He did so.

And was he brought hither in stead of you?

Yes.

O wonderful! O the roguish and audacious fellow!

Woe is me! what do you not yet believe that we have been mocked most basely?

Its a marvel but you believe what this fellow says. I know not what to do.
Do you hear, sirrah? Deny it again, can I not get the truth out of you to day?
Chaerea?

No.

I see, he cannot confess
Without he be punished. Follow me this way. One while he says it, another
while he denies it. Entreat me

I beseech you Phaedria.

Go in a doors.

Ah welladay!

I know not,
How by any other means I can come honestly off hence; there is no help, if
these things be true
Shall you, you knave, make a laughing stock on me here?

I am as sure
Parmeno's, as that I live.

So it is.

I will find
How I may be even with him to day. But now Dorias, what do you persuade
To be done?

Do you ask concerning that maid?

Yes,
Whether should I hold my tongue, or tell it abroad?

Do you, truly if you be wise, not know what you do know;
Neither concerning the Eunuch, nor the deflouring of the maid. By this means
you shall bot
Dorus is gone.

So I will.

But do not I see Chremes? Thais will be here by and by.

Why so?

Because when I came away thence, just then began a bustle
Betwixt them.

Do you have away the gold: I will know of him what the matter is.

EXiforas, sceleste: at etiam restitas? fugitive, prodi:
Male conciliate.

Obsecro.

Oh, illud vide os
Ut sibi distorsit carnifex. Quid huc reditio est?
Quid vest is mutatio? quid narras? paululum si cessassem,


Habesne hominem amabo?

Quid ni habeam?

O factum been (...)

Istuc pol vero been.

Ubi est?

Rogitas? non vides?

Videam, obsecro, quem?

Hunc
Scilicet.

Quis homo hic est?

Qui ad vos


Hunc oculis suis nostrarum nunquam
Quisquam vidit, Phaedria.

Non vidit?

An tu hunc
Credidisti esse, obsecro, ad nos deductum?

Nam quem
Alium? habui neminem.

Au, ne comparandus hic
Quidem est ad illum. Ille erat honesta facie and liberali.


Nunc ^o tibi videtur faedus, quia illam n^n habet.

Tace obsecro; quasi vero paululum inter^iet. Ad nos
Deductus hodie est adolescentulus, quem tu videre ve^o
Velles, Phaedria: Hic est vietus, vetus, veternosus, fenex, color


Hem, quae est fabula? co redigis me,
Ut quid egerim ego nesciam. E^o ru, emin' ego te?

E^isti.

Jube mihi denuo respondeat.

Roga.

Venistin' hodie ad nos? nega^. At ille alter venit natus
Annos sedecim, quem secum adduxit Parmeno.

Agedum,

Vestem? monstrum hominis, number dicturuses?

Venit Chaerea.

Frat^^ne?

Ita.

Quando?

Hodie.

Quam dudum?

Modo.

Quicum?

Cum Parmenone.

Narrasne eum prius?

Non


Unde igitur
Fratrem meum esse sciebas?

Parmeno dicebat
Eum esse: is dedit mihi hanc vestem.

Occidi.

Meam ipse induit, post ambo una abierunt for as.

Jam satis credis sobriam esse me, and nihil mentitam?


Age nunc
Bellua, credis huic quod dicat?

Quid isti credam?
Res ipsa indicat.

Concede istue paululum.
Audin etiam nunc paululum; sat est; dic dum hoc rursum,
Chaerea tuam vestem detraxit tibi?

Factum est.



Factum.

Et pro te huc deductus est?

Ita.

Jupiter magne! O scelestum atque audacem hominem!

Vae mihi; etiam nunc non credis indignis nos esse irrisas modis?

Mirum, ni tu credas, quid iste dicat; quid agam, nescio. Heus tu,
Negato rursum. Possumne ego hodie ex te exculpere verum?


Non.

Video, non potest fateri
Sinc malo. Sequere hac; modo ait, modo negat. Ora me.

Obsecro te vero Phaedria.

I intro.

Hei, hoi.

Al^o
Pacto honest quomodo hinc abeam, nescio. Actum est, siquidem; tu me
Hic etiam nebulo ludificabere?

Parmenonis tam scio


Sic est.

Inveniam
Pol hodie parem ubi referam gratiam. Sed nunc quid faciundum
Suades, Dorias?

De istac virgin rogas?

Ita.
Utrum taceam, an praedicem?

Tu pol si sapis, quod s^ias, nescis,
Neque de Eunucho, neque de vitio virginis. Hac re and te omni


Ita faciam.

Sed videon' Chremem? Thais jam aderit.

Quid ita?

Quia tum inde abeo, jam tum inceperat turba
Inter eos.

Tu aufer aurum: scibo ex hoc quid siet.

ALas, in good truth, I am beguiled. The wine that I have drunk has
over-mastered me
And while I sat at the table, how fine and sober I did think my self to be?
Since I have risen, neither my feet, nor my wit, do as they should do.

Chremes.

Oh, Pythias. O how much fairer now


Truly, you are far more cheerful.

Certoinly this is a true saying, Without meat and drink lust grows cold. But
Thais came long before

Is she Gone from the soldiers already?

Long ago, an age since, there was
A great contention betwixt them.

Did she say nothing then that you should follow her?



Why, was not that enough?

But I did not know that she meant that, but the soldier righted me, which
I did not well understand, for he thrust me out of doors;
But (...) I see her: I wonder where I got before her.

AT at, data hercle verba mihi sunt. Vicit me vinum quod bibi;
Ac dum accubabam, quam videbar mihi esse pulchre sobrius?
Postquam surrexi, neque pes neque men's satis suum officium facit.

Chreme.

Ehem Pythia, vah quanto nunc formosior


Certe quidem tu pol multo alacrior.

Verbum hercle hoc verum est, Sine Cerere
Et Libero friget Venus. Sed Thais multo ante venit.

Anne
Abiit jam a milite?

Jamdudum, aetatem. Lites factae sunt
Inter eos maxumae.

Nihil dixit tum ut sequerere sese?



Eho, nonne id sat erat?

At nesciebam id dicere illam, nisi quia correxit miles; quod
Intellexi minus: nam me extrusit for as.
Sed eccam ipsam video: miror ubi ego huic antevorterim.

I Believe indeed he will be here by and by, that he may take her
From me; Let him come. But if he touch her with one
Finger, I will presently scratch out his eyes; I can so long abide
His fooleries, and his big words, whilst they are but words; but
If they be turned to deeds, he shall he beaten.

Thais, I have been
Here a good while.

O my Crhemes! I look for you. Do you know that this bustle
Was made because of you, and that so all the matter concerns you?

Me, how? as though I made it.

Because whist I labored
To give and restore you your sister again, I have endured these and many the
like things.

Where is she?

At home at my house.

Ha.

What is the matter?
She has been brought up so as it befitteth you and her.

What say you?

As
The matter is, I bestow her on you, and do not demand any thing of you for
her.

Thais, I both thank you, and will also study to requite you, so as you have
deserved

But take heed Chremes, that you do not lose her, before you receive her of me;
For this is she, whom the soldier comes to take from me by force. Pythias,
go yo
And fetch the little cabinet out of the house with the tokens.

Thais, Do you not see him?

Where is it laid?

In the trunk, thru spiteful queen, do thou make no baste?

Do you not see the soldier, and what forces he brings with him? Alas, alas.

What man, I pray you, are you faint-hearted? Away, away.

Am I faint-hearted?
There is no man living less fearful.

And so you have need.

Alas,
I fear what kind of man you think me to be.

Nay consider this,
^im whom you have to do; he is a stranger, less powerful
Then you, not so well acquainted, having fewer friends here.

I know that;
But it is a folly to suffer that to be done, which you may avoid. I had rather
We should provide beforehand, then be revenged on him after a wrong is
received:
Go you and lock the door on the inside, whilst I make a step hence to the
market;
I desire we may have some Mediators here in this combustion.

Tarry, tarry.

It is better.

Tarry.

Let me go,
I will be here again by and by.

Chremes, we have no need of them. Do but say this,
That she is your sister, and that you lost her when she was a little girl,
That you have now come to the knowledge of her. Let him see the tokens.

They are here.

Lay hold of him: If he shall offer any violence, bring an action against him.
Do you understand me?

Very well.

See you speak this with a good courage.

I will.

Take up you cloak about you. Alas, he himself has need of a Counselor,
Whom I have got to defend me.

CRedo equidem illum jam jam adfuturum esse, ut illam a me
Eripiat. Sine veniat. Atqui si illam digito attigerit
Uno, oculi illico effodientur. Usque adeo ego illius far possum
Ineptias and magnifica verba, verba dum sint; verum enim


Thais, ego jamdudum
Hic adsum.

O mi Chremes, teipsum expecto. Scin' tu turbam
Hanc propter te esse factam, and adeo ad te attinere hanc omnem rem?

Ad me, qui? quasi istuc.

Quia dum tibi sororem studeo
Reddere ac restituere, haec atque hujusmodi sum multa passa.



Domi apud me.

Hem.

Quid est?
Educta est ita ut teque illaque dignum est.

Quid ais?

Quod
Res est. Hanc tibi dono do, neque repeto pro illa quicquam abs te pretii.

Et habetur and referetur, Thaeis, a me ita uti merita es, gratia.

At enim cave, ne priusquam hanc a me accipias, amittas, Chreme,

Pythias, domo effer cum monumentis.

Viden' tu illum, Thais?

Ubi sita est.

In risco; odiosa cessas?

Militem fecum
Atque quantas copias adducere? At, at.

Number formidolosus
Obsecro es, mi homo? apagesis.

Egon' formidolosus?


Aque ita opus est.

Au,
Metuo qualem tu me hominem esse existumes.

Immo hoc
Cogitato, quicum res tibi est, peregrinus est, minus potens
Quam tu minus notus, minus amicorum hic habens.

Scio
Isthuc, sed tu quod cavere possis stultum est admittere. Malo ego

Atque obsera ostium intus, dum ego hinc transcurro ad forum.
Volo hic ego addesse advocatos nobis in turba hac.

Mane, mane.

Melius est.

Mane.

Omit,
Jam adero.

Nihil opus est istis, Chreme. Hoc modo die

Nunc cognosse; signa ostende.

Adsunt.

Cape,
Si vim faciet, in jus ducito hominem. Intellextin'?

Probe.

Fac animo haec praesenti dicas.

Faciam.

Attolle pallium. Phy, huic ipsi opus patrono est, quem


GNatho, Is it fit that, I should put up this so notable abuse offered me?
It is better for me to die. Simalio, Dorax, Syriscus,
M^rch after me. First of all I will pull down the house.

Very well.

I will take the maid away by force.

Exceeding well.

I will punish her sharply.

Bravely spoken!

Dorax, come hither, into the middle of the army with the door-bar.
Do you Simalio, march into the left wing; and you, Syriscus, into the right.
Give me the rest
Where is Captain Sanga, and his company of slaves?

Look at him,
Here he is.

What, you coward, do you think to fight with a di^^clout,
That you bring it hither?

What I? I know the vatour of my General,

Without blood shed, and therefore I brought to wipe their wounds.

Where are the others?

What others with a mischief? None but Sannio
Keeps the house.

Do, set these in array here. And I being behind
The Vaunt-guard will thence give the Word to all.

That is a wise part:


This same thing.
Now Pyrrhus was wont to do.

Do you not see Thais,
What thing he does? Certainly that was very good counsel which I gave you
About shutting up the door.

That which seems to you now a a gallant fellow,
Is but this great boobie? do not fear him.

What do you think?


Out of this close place; they would run away.

But look where I see
Thais her self.

How quickly do we fall in upon them?

Tarry: It becomes
A wise man to try all things by words rather then arms. How know you, whether
She will do what I command her without compulsion or not?

O strange!


First and foremost, answer me this, when I gave you that maid,
Did not you say, you would keep me only company these days?

And what then?

Do you ask? who have brought me your lover here present before your eyes.

What can you do to him?

And conveyed your self-with him privily from me.



Therefore give me Pamphila again hither.
Except you had rather her taken from you by force.

Should she give her you, or ought you to meddle with her you errant rascal?

Ah, what do you do? hold your tongue. What mean you?

Ought not I meddle
With my own?

What yours you rogue!

Have a care, you know not
What a man you now give ill words to.

Do you get you gone hence? Do you know

I will make you always remember this place, and day, and me too.

I am sorry for you, that you make such a worthy man as this your enemy.

I will break your pate by and by, unless you be gone.

Say you so indeed you cur; do you do so?

What fellow are you?


You shall know.
First I say she is a free woman.

Ha.

A Citizen of Athens.

Whoo.

My own sister.

You impudent fellow!

Soldier,
Moreover I charge you, that you offer no violence toward her. I am going
To Sophrona the nurse, to fetch her, and show her these tokens.



I forbid you,
I say.

Do you hear? This man accuses himself of felony,
Is not this sufficient for you?

Do you say so too, Thais?

Go look some body
That may answer you.

What do we now?

Marry let us go back again,
She will come to you by and by, beseeching you on her own accord.

Think you so?

Yes,

They fain will with all their heart.

You think rightly.

I will now disband the army.

When you will.

Sanga, as becomes valiant soldiers, see
You remember to do at home, and by the fireside.

My mind is in the pottage pot
Long ago.

You are an honest fellow.

March after me this way.

HAnccine ego ut contumeliam tam insignem in me accipiam,
Gnatho? Mori me satius est. Simalio, Dorax, Syrisce,
Sequimini. Primum aedes expugnabo.

Recte.

Virginem eripiam.

Probe.

Male mulctabo ipsam.



In medium huc agmen cum vecti Dorax;
Tu, Simalio, in sinistrum cornu; tu, Syrisce, in dexterum. Cedo alios.
Ubi centurio est Sanga, and manipulus furum?

Eccum
Adest.

Quid, ignave, peniculon' pugnare, qui
Istum huc portas, cogitas?

Egone? imperatoris

Hoc non posse fieri, qui abstergerem vulnera.

Ubi alii?

Qui malum alii? solus Sannio servat
Domum.

Tu hosce instrue hic. Ego vero post
Principia, inde omnibus signum dabo.

Illuc est sapere:


Idem hoc
Jam Pyrrhus factitavit.

Viden' tu, Thais,
Quam hic remagit? nimirum concilium illud rectum est
De occludendis aedibus.

Sane, quod tibi nunc vir videatur
Esse, hic nebulo magnus est, ne metuas.

Quid videtur?


Ex occulto caederes; facerent fugam.

Sed eccam Thaidem
Ipsam video.

Quam mox irruimus?

Mane. Omnia
Prius experi^i verbis quam armis sapientem decet. Qui scis, an
Quae jubeam sine vi faciat?

Dii vestram fidem! quanti est


Thais, primum hoc mihi responde, cum tibi do istam virginem,
Dixtin', hos dies mihi soli dare te?

Quid tum postea?

Rogitas? quae mihi ante oculos tuos coram amatorem adduxisti tuum?

Quid cum illo agas?

Et cum eo cla n te subduxisti mihi.



Pamphilam ergo huc read, nisi vi mavis
Eripi.

Tibi illam reddat, aut tu eam tangas, omnium?

Ah, quid agis? tace. Quid tu tibi vis?

Ego non tangam
Meam?

Tuam autem, furcifer?

Cave sis, Nescis cui
Maledicas nunc viro.

Number tu hinc abis? Scin' tu ut

Faciam ut hujus loci, dieique, meique semper memineris.

Miseret tui me, qui hunc tantum hominem facias inimicum
Tibi.

Diminuam ego caput tuum hodie, nisi abis.

Ain' vero canis? siccine agis?

Quis tu homo es?


Scibis.
Principio, eam esse dico liberam.

Hem!

Civem Atticam.

Hui!

Meam sororem.

Os durum.

Miles,
Nunc adeo edico tibi, ne vim facias ullam in illam. Ego co
Ad Sophronam nutricem, ut eam adducam, and signa ostendam


Tun' me prohibeas meam ne tangam?

Prohibe^,
Inquam.

Audin' tu? hic furti se alligat,
Satin' hoc tibi est?

Idem tu hoc ais, Thais?

Quaere,
Qui respondeat.

Quid nunc agimus?

Quin redeamus? jam haec
Tibi aderit supplcans ultro.

Credin'?

Immo

Cupiunt ultro.

Been putas.

Jam dimitto exercitum.

Ubi vis.

Sanga, ut fortes decet milites, domi focique
Fac vicissim ut memineris.

Jamdudum animus est
In patinis,

Frugi es.

Vos me hac sequimini.

DO you go on to talk doubtfully, you errant queen?
I know, I know not: I heard it: I was not there.
Will not you tell it me plainly, whatsoever it is?
The maid with her clothes rent, is weeping, and says not a word.
The Eunuch is gone: why so? what is done, do thou not speak?

What should I poor woman say to you? they say it was not An Eunuch.

Who was it then?

That same Chaerea.

What, Chaerea?

That young stripling Phaedria' s brother.

What say you, you witch!

But I have found it to be true.

How, I pray you, came he to our house, or wherefore was he brought?

I know not, but I that think he loved Pamphila.

Alas, I am undone, poor woman!
I am unfortunate, if those things be true which you say.
Why does the maid weep?

For that I suppose.

What say you,
You wicked queen? Did not I give you charge about that, when I went away
hence?

15r
What should I do? she was committed to him alone, as you gave order.

You queen, you committed a sheep to a wolf; I am ashamed
That I should be thus deceived: What fellow is it?

Mistress, hold your tongue, I pray you, we are well enough.
We have the man himself.

Where is he?

Look you, on your left hand.
Do you not see him?

I do see him.

Cause him to be laid hold on, as soon as you can.

You fool, what shall we do to him?

What should I do, do you ask?
See, I pray you, if when you look on him, he seem not to be a shameless
person,

He is not; besides, how very confident is he?

PErgin' scelesta mecum perplexe loqui?
Scio, nescio: abiit: audivi: ego non assui.
Non tu istuc mihi dictura a perre es, quicquid est?
Virgo, conscissa vest, lachrymans obticet.


Quid tibi ego dicam misera? illum Eunuchum negant Fuisse.

Quis fuit igitur?

Iste Chaerea.

Qui Chaerea.

Iste ephebus frater Phaedriae.

Quid ais, venefica?

Atqui certe-repperi.



Nescio; nisi amasse credo Pamphilam.

Hem, misera, occidi.
Infoelix, siquidem tu istaec vera praedicas.
Quid lacrymat virgo?

Id opinor.

Quid ais,
Sacrilega? Istuccine interminat^^ sum hinc abiens tibi?



Scelesta, ovem lupo commisisti; dispudet,
Sic mihi data esse verba; quid illic hominis est?

Hera mea, tace obsecro, salvae sumus.
Habemus hominem ipsum.

Ubi is est?

He^, ad fini^.


Video.

Comprehendi jube, quantum potes.

Quid illi faciemus, stulta?

Quid faciam, rogas?
Vide amabo, si non, cum aspicias, os impudens
Videtur.

Non est, tum quae ejus confidentia est?

AT Antipho' s house, both his mother and father
Were at home, as if it had been for the nonce, so as I could
By no means go in, but they must see me. In the mean time
Whilst I was standing at the door, an acquaintance of mine
Came and met me; when he saw me, I betook me to my heels as fast as I could,
Into a back corner where no body dwelt, and from that
Into another, and thence into another; so I became most wretched
In running away, for fear any body should know me.
But is this Thais, which I see? it is she. I am at a stand.
What shall I do? what is it to me? what will she do to me?

Let us go to him. Good man Dorus, God save you: tell me, did you run away?

Mistress, I did so.

Do you like that very well?

No.

Did you think you should go scot-free?

Forgive me this one fault,
And if ever I do any more, I will give you leave to kill me.

Was you afraid of my cruelty?

No.

What then?

I was afraid of this woman, lest she should accuse me unto you.

What had you done?

A very small matter.

Ah you shameless fellow, a small matter? Do you think it
A small matter to defile a maid that is a Citizen?

I took her to be my fellow servants.

Your fellow servants? I can scarce refrain my self
But I must fly about his ears; the ugly knave besides
Comes voluntarily to mock us.

Can you be gone you mad girl?

Why forsooth
Should I go hence? should I believe that rogue in any thing? especially
When he confesses himself to be your servant?

Let us see these things pass: Chaerea, you have not done
As it became you; For though I very well deserve to have
This abuse, yet you was an unmeet person to do it.
Neither indeed do I know what course to take
About this maid; you have put me to such a nonplus,
That I cannot restore her to her friends,
So as it was fitting; and as I endeavored,
That I might gain my self thanks for a complete benefit, Chaerea.

But I hope there will be henceforward a continual amity
Betwixt us, Thais; for often times from some such thing as this is,
And from a bad beginning, great acquaintance
Has grown. What if some God would have it thus?

Truly I construe it in that sense, and wish it may be so.

Nay, I pray you, understand this one thing, that I did not do it
To abuse you, but out of love.

I know it.
And therefore indeed I the rather pardon you.
I am not of so unkind a nature, Chaerea,
Nor so unexperienced, that I should not be able to know, what love can do.

Thais, I swear, I love you too.

Then, Mistress, I perceive you had need to take heed of this fellow.

I dare not be so bold.

I do not trust you any whit at all.

Give over.

Thais, I commit and commend my self to your fidelity.
Now I beseech you be my helper in this matter.
I desire you to be my patroness, and I beseech you:
I wish I were dead, if I do not marry her hereafter.

Yet if you father.

What! I am sure be will be willing,
If so be she be but a Citizen.

Tarry here a little
If you will; the maids brother will be here by and by:
He went to fetch the nurse, which nursed her when she was a little one.
Chaerea, you your self shall be by at the owning of her.

I will indeed tarry.

Will you, in the mean time whilst he come,
That we tarry at home rather, than here before the door?

Yes, I am heartily willing to it.

I pray you, what are you going to do?

For why?

Do you ask? Do you think to entertain this fellow Into the house hereafter?

Why not?

Take this on my word, 60. He will make some bustle again.

Tush, I pray thee, hold thy tongue.

You seem not to have observed his boldness.

Pythias, I will no do so.

Truly, Chaetea, I do not trust you; Unless it be in a thing not committed to
you

But, Pythias,
Do you look to me.

Truly I dare neither commit any thing to you
To keep, nor take charge of you. Away with you.

Her brother is here in good time.

Truly I am undone, I pray you
Let us go hence in adoors, Thais. I am loath he should see me
In the street with these clothes.

Why so, for sooth; is it because you are ashamed?

That is the matter.

That is the matter? a maid I warrant you?

Go before, I will come after:
do you stay there, that you may bring in Chremes.

APud Antiphonem uterque matter and pater,
Quasi dedita opera domi erant, ut nullo modo
Introne possem, quin viderent me. Interim
Dum ante ostium sto, notus mihi quidam obviam

In angiportum quoddam desertum, inde item
In aliud, inde in aliud, ita miserrimus
Fui fugitando, ne quis me cognosceret.
Sed estne Thais, quam video? ipsa est. Haereo,


Adeamus. Bone vir, Door, salve. dic mihi, aufugistin'?

Hera, factum.

Satin' id tibi placet?

Non.

Credin' te impune abiturum?

Unam hanc noxam
Amitte, si aliam admisero unquam, eccidito.



Non.

Quid igitur?

Hanc metui, ne me criminaretur tibi.

Quid fecera^?

Paululum quiddam.

Eho impudens, paululum? An paululum esse
Hoc tibi videtur, virginem vitiare civem?



Conservam? vix me contineo,
Quum involem in capillum; monstrum eriam ultro
Derisum advenit.

Abin' hinc insana?

Quid ita vero
Abeam? Credon' isti quicquam furcifero, praesertim
Cum se servum fateatur tuum?


Fecisti. Nam si ego digna hac contumelia
Sum maxume, at tu indignus qui faceres tamen.
Neque aedipol quid nunc consilii capiam, scio,
De virgin istac: ita conturba stimihi

Ita ut aequum fuerat, atque ut studui tradere,
Ut solidum pararem hoc mihi beneficium, Chaerea.

At dehinc spero aeternam inter nos gratiam
Fore, Thais: saepe ex hujusmodi re quapiam,

Conflata est. Quid si hoc quispiam voluit Deus?

Equidem pol in eam partem accipioque and volo.

Immo ita quaeso, unum hoc scito, contumeliae
Non me fecisse causa, sed amoris.

Scio,

Non adco inhumano sum ingenio, Chaerea,
Neque imperita, ut quid amor valeat, nesciam.

Te quoque Thais, ita me dii been ament, amo.

Tum pol tibi ab istoc, hera, cavendum intelligo.



Nihil tibi quicquam credo.

Desinas.

Ego me tuae committo and commendo fidei.
Nunc ego te in hac re mihi oro ut adjutrix sies.
Te mihi patronam cupio, Thais, te obsecro;
Emoriar, si non hanc uxorem duxero.



Quid? ah volet, corto scio,
Civis modo haec sit.

Paululum operirier
Si vis. Jam frater ipse hic aderit, virginis.
Nutricem accersitum iit, quae illam aluit parvulam.
In cognoscendo tute ipse hic aderis, Chaerea.



Visne interea dum venit,
Domi oppe^iamur potius, quam hic ante ostium.

Imo percupio.

Quam tu rem actura, obsecro, es?

Nam quid ita?

Rogitas? Hunc tu in aedes cogitas
Recipere posthac?

Cur non?

Creed hoc meae fidei,


Au, tace, obsecro.

Parum prospexisse ejus videre audaciam.

Non faciam, Pythias.

Non pol credo, Chaerea,
Nisi si commissum non erit.

Quin, Pythias,
Tu me servato.

Neque pol servandum tibi


Adest optime ipse frater.

Perii hercle, obsecro,
Abeamus intro, Thais: Nolo me in via
Cum hac vest videat.

Quamobrem tandem? an quia pudet?

Id ipsum.

Id ipsum? virgo vero?

I prae, sequar.


What? what can I now devise in my mind?
What? how shall I requite that wicked fellow,
That put him upon us?

Stir you self apace,
Nurse.

I stir.

I see that, but you make no riddance.

Have you showed the tokens already to the nurse?

All.

I pray you, what says she? does she know them?

Yes, and remembers them too.

Truly you tell me good news, for I wish the maid well.
Go ye in, my Mystress has looked for you at home a good while ago.
But look, I see that honest man Parmeno go along.
Do you see how leisurely he goes, forsooth.
I hope I have got a trick, how to vex him after my own fashion.
I will go in, that I may know the certainty about the owning of her:
Afterward I will come forth, and terrify this wicked varlet.

QUid? quid venire in mentem nunc possit mihi?
Quidnam? qui referam illi sacrilego gratiam,
Qui hunc supposuit nobis?

Move vero ocyus
Te nutrix.

Moveo.

Video, sed nihil promoves.



Omnia.

Amabo, quid ait, cognoscitne?

Ac memoriter.

Been aedipol narras: nam illi faveo virgini.
Ite intro, jamdudum hera vos expectat domi.
Virum bonum eccum Parmenonem incedere

Spero me habere qui hunc mco excruciem modo.
Ibo intro, de cognitione ut certum sciam:
Post exibo, atque hunc perteribo sacrilegum.

I Come again to see what Chaerea does here;
For if he have cunningly carried the matter, O strange!
What and how real commendations shall Parmeno get?
For to let that pass, that I have gotten him his love, which was very hard,
and
Dear to purchase of a covetous whore, that maid which he loved, Without any
trouble, without any charge, without any loss: That other thing;
That indeed is it which I think I deserve the garland for,
That I have found, how a young man may know
The dispositions and behavior of whores;
That when one knows them betimes, he may hate them for ever;
Who whilst they are ahroad, nothing in the world is more cleanly,
Nor any thing more demure, nor more neat;
Who when they sup with their lover, feed nicely; but
How nasty they are at home, by themselves, and greedy of neat;
After what fashion they sosse brown-bread out of cock-crown pottage:
To know all these things is a making to young men.

You rogue, I will indeed be revenged on you for those your sayings,
And doings; that you may not play upon us scot-free.

REviso, quidnam Chaerea hic rerum gerat,
Quod si astu rem tractavit, Dii vostram fidem!
Quantam and quam veram laudem capiet Parmeno?
Nam ut mittam, quod and amorem difficillimum, and

Quam amabat, came confeci sine molestia,
Sine sumptu, sine dispendio: Tum hoc alterum,
Id vero est quod ego mihi puto palmarium,
Me reperisse, quomodo adolescentulus
Meretricum ingenia and mores posset noscere:

Quae dum for is sunt, nihil videtur mundius,
Nee magis compositum quidquam, nec magis elegans:
Quae cum amatore cum coenant, liguriunt:
Harum videre ingluviem, sordes, inopiam,
Quam inhonestae solae sint domi, a^que avidae cibi,

Nosse omnia haec, salus est adolescentulis.

Ego pol te pro is it is dictis and factis, scelus,
Ulciscar, ut ne impune in nos illuseris.

O Wonderful strange, an ugly prank! that unhappy young man! O roguish Parmeno,
who brought him hither

What is the matter?

It pitieth me to see it, and therefore I poor woman can hither out of doors,
that I might not see it.
What examples do they think shall be made of him, which are not sor him?

O Jupiter,
What ado is there? am not I undone? I will go to her: What is the matter,
Pythias
What say you? on whom shall examples be made?

Do you ask, you bold fellow?
You have undone that young man whom you brought instead of the Eunuch,
Whilst you strive to begule us.

Why so, or what is done, tell me?

I will tell you: That maid which was given for a present to Tha is to day;
Do you know that she is a Citizen here hence, and that her brother is a great
Gentleman?

I know it not.

But she is found so to be, the poor youth has defloured her,
When her brother being a very passionate man knew these things.

What did he?

First, he bound him after a pitiful manner.

Bound him, what now?

And indeed when Thais entreated him that he would not do it.

What say you?

Now he threatens moreover that he will do, as is used to be done to
whoremasters;
A thing which I never saw to be done, nor desire to see.

With what confidence
Dares he to attempt so great a villainy?

Why so great?

Do not you think it a very great one?
What man ever saw one taken for a whoremaster
In a baudie house?

I know not.

But Pythias, that ye may not but know this,
I tell you, and tell you plainly, that he is our masters son.

Alas,
I pray you is it he?

Let not Thais suffer any wrong to be done to him,
And withal, why do not I my self go in?

Have a care Parmeno,
What you do, lest you do him no good, but undo your self; for they think
this,
What ever it is that is done, to be long of you.

What then shall I do poor man,
Or what shall I begin? but lo I see the old man coming out of the country
again,
Should I tell him, or not? Truly I will tell him though I know some great harm
Attends me. But it is necessary that he should help him.

You are wise,
I am going in. Do you tell him all the matter in order: how it was done.

PRo Deum fidem, facinus foedumio infoelicem adolescentulum! O scclestum
Parmenonem, qui istum huc adduxit

Quid est?

Miscret me: itaque ut ne viderem, misera huc effugi for as.
Quae futura exempla dicunt in eum indigna?

O Jupiter,

Quid ais, in quem exempla sient?

Rogitas audacissime?
Perdidisti istum, quem adduxti pro Eunucho, adolescentulum,
Dum studes dare verba nobis.

Quid ita? aut quid factum est, cedo.

Dicam; virginem istam, Thaidi hodie quae dono data est,


Nescio.

Atqui sic inventa est, came iste vitiavit miser,
Ille ubi haec rescivit frater violentissimus.

Quidnam fecit?

Pri^um cum miseris modis.

Colligavit? Hem!

Atque equidem orante, ut ne id faceret, Thaide.



Nunc minitatur porro sese id facturum, quod maechis solet,
Quod ego nunquam vidi fieri, neque velim.

Qua audacia tantum
Facinus audet?

Quid ita tantum?

Annon tibi hoc maxumum?
Quis homo pro maecho unquam vidit in domo meretricia
Deprehendi quenquam?

Nescio.

At ne hoc nesciatis, Pythias,


Hem!
Obsecro an is est?

Ne quam in illum Thais vim fieri sinat.
Atque adeo autem, cur non egomet int^o eo?

Vide, Parmeno,
Quid agas, ne neque illi prosis, and tu pereas; nam hoc putant,
Quicquid factum est, a te esse ortum.

Quid igitur faciam miser?

Dicam huic, an non? Dicam hercle, etsi mihi magnum malum
Scio paratum. S^d necesse est ut huic subveniat.

Sapis,
Ego abeo intro. Tu isti narrato omnem rem ordine, ut factum est.

I Get this benefit by my conntrey farm which lies near the city, I never
^feel^ any wearisomness either of the^ country o
When I begin to be weary, I change my place.
But is not this Parmeno? Certainly, it is even be:
Parmeno, here before the door?

What man is that? Ho master, you are welcome hither.

Whom do you tarry for Parmeno? I am undone. I am not able
To speak for fear.

Ha, what is the matter, why do you tremble?
Are they all well? tell me.

Master, I would first have you to think

Is not done through my fault.

What is it?

You have done well to ask.
I should have told you the matter before hand. Phaedria bought an Eunuch,
Which he bestowed on this woman.

On whom?

On Thais.

Has he bought one?
Without doubt I am undone; for how much?

For twenty pounds.

There is no remedy.

Chaerea is in love here with a minstrelless.

How now, what?
Is he in love, does he know already what a whore means? is he come to the
town
One mischief comes on the neck of another.

Master, do not look on me,
He does not these things at my setting on.

Speak no more of your self, you rogue,
If I live, I will; but first tell me this whatsoever it is.

He was brought
Thais instead of that Eunuch.

Instead of the Eunuch.

Yes, Afterward they apprehended him within, in stead of the Eunuch, and bound
him

I am undone.

See the boldness of these whores.

Is there any more
Mischief or harm besides, which you have not told me?

This is all.

Do I forbear to break in hither within upon them?

There is no doubt, but some

I am glad that any mischief is like to befall these by my means.
For the old man now a long time has fought some occasion,
How he might play them some not able trick: and now he has found one.

EX meo propinquo rure, hoc capio commodi, Neque agri n^que urbis odium me
unquam percipit
Ubi satias coepit fieri, commuto locum.
Sed estne ille Parmeno? and certe ipsus est.


Quis homo est? Ehem, salvum te advenisse, here, gaudeo.

Quem praestolare, Parmeno?

Perii. Metu
Lingua haeret.

Ehem, quid est? quid tu trepidas?
Satin' salvae? dic mihi.

Here, primum te arbitrari

Culpa non factum est mea.

Quid?

Recte sane interrogasti.
Oportuit rem praenarrasse me. Emit quendam Phaedria Eunuchum,
Quem dono huic daret.

Cui?

Thaidi.

Emit? Perii
Hercle; quanti*

Viginti minis.

Actum est.

Tum


Ehem, quid?
Amat? an scit jam ille quod meretrix siet; an in astu venit?
Aliud ex alio malum.

Here, ne me spectes, me impulsore
Haec non facit.

Omit de te dicere; ego te, furcifer,
Si vivo; sed istud quicquid est primum expedi.

Is pro illo


Pro Eunuchon'?

Sic est. Hunc pro Eunucho postea comprehendere intus and constrinxere.

Occidi.

Audaciam meretricum specta.

Numquid est
Aliud mali damnive, quod non dixeris, reliquum?

Tantum est.

Cesso huc intro irrumpere?

Non dubium est quin mihi magnum

Id gaudeo propter me hisce aliquid esse eventurum mali:
Nam jam diu aliquam causam quaerebat senex,
Quamobrem insigne aliquid faceret iis: nunc repperit.

TRuly never any thing happened to me this many a day,
Which I more desired might happen, then that the old man came just now in into
our house being mistaken
He was a laughing stock to me only, who knew what he feared.

But what is the matter?

Now I come forth, that I may speak with Parmeno.


Does she seek for me?

And lo I see him.
I will go to him.

What is the matter you foolish girl? what would you have? what do you laugh
at? Do you go on

I am undone,
I am weary already poor woman with laughing at you.

Why so?

Do you ask?
I never saw, nor never shall see a foolisher fellow then you are; ah
It cannot be sufficiently told what sport you have made within:


What is the matter?

Must you needs presently believe those things which I told you?
Did it not repent you of the wicked act, which the young man had done,
By your advice, unless you must further bewray the poor man to his father?
For what heart do you think he had then, when his father saw him


Ha, what say you, you errant queen? did you tell me a lie? what do you laugh?
Do you think it such a fine trick to mock us, you drab!

A very fine one.

If you can escape scot-free with that.

But what can you do?

I will requite you.

I think so. But Parmeno, that which you threaten me perhaps is for a long time
to come

By such villainous deeds, and bewray him too: They will both of them make you
an example

I am quite undone.

This is the honor you are like to have for that service. I am gone.

I poor man am undone to day, like a rat, by my own squeaking.

NUnqua^ aedipol quidquam jam diu, quod magis vellem evenire,
Mihi evenit, quam quod modo senex intro ad nos venit errans.
Mihi soli ridiculo fuit, quae quid timeret sciebam.

Quid hoc autem est?

Nunc id prodeo, ut conveniam Parmenonem.


Me quaerit haec?

Atque eccum video.
Adibo.

Quid est, inepta? quid tibi vis? quid rides? Pergin'?

Perii,
Defessa jam sum misera te ridendo.

Quid ita?

Rogitas?
Nunquam pol hominem stultiorem vidi, nec videbo; ah,
Non satis potest narrari quos ludos praebueris intus:


Quid?

Illi^one credere ea, quae dixi, oportuit te?
An poenitebat flagitii, te authore, quod fecisset
Adolescens, ni miserum insuper etiam patri indicares?
Nam quid illi credis animi tum fuisse, ubi vestem vidit


Ehem, quid dixti, pessuma? an mentita es? etiam rides?
Itan' lepidum tibi visum est scelus, nos irridere?

Nimium.

Siquidem istuc impune habueris.

Verum.

Reddam hercle.

Credo, sed in diem istuc Parmeno est fortasse, quod minitare:

Nobilitas flagiriis, and cundem indicas: uterque exempla in te edent.

Nullus sum.

Hic pro illo tibi munere honos est habitus. Abco.

Egomet meo indicio miser, quasi forex, hodie perii.

WHat now, with what hope, or to what intent go we hither? what do you attempt
Thraso

What I? that I may yield my self to Thais, and do as she bids me.

What is that?

May I not as well serve her, as Hercules served Omphale:

I like the example: I wish I may see your head broken with her slipper.


But what mischief is this?
I never saw this fellow yet; why does he skip forth so hastily?

QUid nunc! qua spe, aut quo consilio huc imus? quid incoeptas Thraso?

Egone? ut Thaidi me dedam, and faciam quod jubeat.

Quid est?

Qui minus huic, quam Hercules servivit Omphalae?

Exemplum placet. Utinam tibi commitigari videam sandalio caput.


Quid autem hoc est mali?
Hunc ego nunqua^ videram etiam; quidnam hic properans prosilit?

O Country men, is any man living more happy then I?
Truly no man at all, for the gods have plainly showed all their power
On me, to whom so many good things have come together on such a sudden.

Why is he so merry?

O my Parmeno, O thou that art the inventer,

Do you know that my Pamphila is found to be a citizen?

I have heard so.

And
Do you know that she is my bride?

It is well done, I swear.

Do you not hear what he says?

Besides I am glad for my brother Phaedria,
That all his love is secure: there is but one house;
Thais commended her self into my fathers protection and fidelity.
She has yielded her self to us.

Then Thais is wholly your brothers.

Yes.
Now this is another thing whereof we may be glad; the Soldier is driven out of
doors
Then do you see, that my brother wherever he is, may hear of these things as
soon as may be

I will go see for him at home.

Do you make any doubt now Gnatho, but that I am undone for ever?



What, shall I mention the first, or whom should I most
Commend? Him that gave me advice to do it, or my self that durst adventure
To begin? or should I extol fortune, which was my conductress?
Which has brought to pass so many things, so great, so fitly, all in one day?
Or shall I commend my fathers pleasantness, and courteous behavior?


O strange! what incredible things did Parmeno tell me even now?
But where is my brother?

He is at hand.

I am glad of it.

I verily believe so.
Brother, there is nothing in the world deserves more to be loved, than this
your Thais
She is such a fautrix to all our family.

Whoo, do you commend her to me?

I am undone.
Gnatho help me,
My hope hangs on thee.

What would you have me do?

Bring this to pass
By entreaty or for money, that I may have some share in Thais's favor now at
last

It is a hard matter?

If you have any list, I knew you what you can do:
If you will but do it, ask what gift or reward you will, and you shall have it
at a wish



It shall be so.

If I bring it to pass, I desire this, that your house
May be open to me, whether you be present, or absent, that I may always have
a place, though I be uninvited

I give you my word it shall be so.

I will go about it.

Whom do I hear here?
O Thraso!

God save you.

Perhaps you do not know what things are done here.

I do know.

Why then do I see you in these quarters?



Do you know how you rely? Soldier, I tell you plainly,
If I find you in this street ever hereafter, it shall not avail you to say to
me I was seeking another man
I was passing this way; you are but a dead man.

Soft, it does not become you to do so.

I have said it.

I am not acquainted with your proud behavior.

I shall be so.

First, hear me a few words, which when I shall have said, do as you please.



Do you Thraso, go aside thither a little. First, I would fain have you
Both believe me this, that whatsoever I do in this matter,
I do it chiefly for my own sake; but if it be also beneficial to you, it is a
foll
For you not to do it.

What is that?

I think the royal soldier ought to be entertained.

What, to be entertained?

Do but consider of it; Phaedria, you indeed

You have but little to give, and Thais must of necessity receive much,
That she may be able to maintain your love without your cost.
For all these purposes, there is no man more fit, or more for your use.
First, he both has what to give, and no body gives more freely then he.

And you need not fear lest the woman should love him, you may easily drive him
away, when you will

What do we do?

Besides, this also which I think to be a very main matter,
There is no body entertaineth a man better, nor more lavishly at all.

It is a wonder if we shall not have need of that man one way or other.

I think so to.


Into your company; I have labored about this long enough.

We entertain you.

And with all our hearts.

But I Phaedria, you Chaerea for this favor
Will deliver him up to you to be devoured, and made a fool on.

Content.

He deserves it.

Thraso, come hither when you will.

I pray you what do we?


And commended you according to your deeds, and virtuous qualities:
I have obtained my request.

It is well done of you, I thank you heartily:
I was never yet in any place, but every body loved me very well.

Did not I tell you, that this man did roll in Rherorick?



O Populares, ecquis me hodie vivit fortunatior?
Nemo hercle quisquam. Nam in me plane dii potestatem suam
Omnem ostendere, cui tam subito tot congruerint commoda.

Quid hic laetus est?

O Parmeno mi, O mearum voluptatum omnium

Scis Pamphilam meam inventam civem?

Audivi.

Seis
Sponsam mihi?

Been, ita me Dii been ament, factum.

Audin' tu, hic quid ait?

Tum autem Phaedriae
Meo fratri gaudeo, esse amorem omnem in tranquillo: una est domus:

Nobis dedit (...).

Fratris igitur Thais tota est.

Scilicet.
Jam hoc aliud est quod gaud^amus, miles pellitur for as.
Tum tu, frater ub^ ubi est, fac quam primum haec audiat.

Visam domi.

Nunquid, Gnatho* ^c dubitas, quin ego nunc perpetuo perierim?


Quid commemorem primum, aut quem laudem
Maxume? Illumne qui mihi dedit consilium ut facerem, an me qui ausus (...)
Incipere? an fortunam collaudem quae gubernatris fuit?
Quae tot res tantas, tam opportune in unum conclusit diem?
An mei patris festivit^ and fac^em?


D^ vostram fi^meno modo quae narravit?
Sed ubi est frater?

^o est.

Gaudeo.

Satis credo.
Nihil est Thaide ^a dignius quod ametui; ita nestrae omni est
Fautrix familiae.

H^i, ^h^illam laudas?

Perii.

In te spes est.

Quid vis. faciam?

Perfice hoc precibus,
Pretio, ut haeream in part aliqua tandem apud Thaidem.

Difficile est.

Si quid collibuit, novi te. Si effeceris,
Quidvis donum and praemium a me optato, id optatum feres.



Sic erit.

Si effecero, hoc postulo, ut tua mihi domus,
Te praesente, absente, pateat: invocato ut sit locus semper.

Do fidem, futurum.

Acc^ngar.

Quem ego hic audio?
O Th^so!

Salvete.

Tu fortasse quae facta hic scient, nescis.

Scio.

Cur te ergo in his ego conspicio regionibus?



Scin' quam fretus? miles, edico tibi, si te in plate (...)
Offendero hac post unquam, nihil est quod dicas mihi, Alium quaerebam,
Iter hac habui: periisti.

Eja, haud sic decet.

Dictum est.

Non cognosco vestrum tam superbum.

Sic erit.

Prius audite paucis, quod cum dixero, facitote.



Tu concede paululum istuc, Th^aso. Principio ego vos.
Ambos credere hoc mihi vehementer volo, me hujus quicquid faciam,
Id facere maxume causa mea: verum si idem vobis prodest, vos non
Facere inscitia est.

Quid est?

Militem ego rivalem recipiendum
Censeo.

Hem, recipiendum?

Cogita modo; tu hercle cum illa

Quod des paulum est, and necesse est multum accipere Thaidem,
Ut tuo amori suppeditare possit sine sumptu tuo.
Ad omnia haec, magis opportunus, nec magis ex usu tuo
Nemo est; principio and habet quod det, and dat nemo largius.

Neque istum metuas, ne amet mulier: facile pellas ubi velis.

Quid agimus?

praeterea, hoc etiam quod ego vel plurimum puto,
Accipit hominem nemo melius prorsum, neque prolixius.

Mirum ni illoc homine quoquo pacto opus est.

Idem ego arbitror.


Recipiatis, satis diu jam hoc saxum volvo.

Recipimus.

Ac lubenter.

At ego pro istoc o Phaedria, and tu Chaerea,
Hunc comedendum and deridendum vobis praebebo.

Placet.

Dignus est.

Thraso, ubi vis, accede.

Obesecro te, quid agimus?


Et collaudavi secundum facta and virtutes tuas:
Impetravi.

Been fecisti, gratiam habeo maxumam,
Nunquam etiam fui usquam, quin me omnes amarint plurimum.

Dixtin' ego vobis in hoc esse Atticam eloquentiam?
