MY Lords,
Know that we far from any natural pride
Or touch of temporal sway, have seen our face
In our grave counsels foreheads: where does stand
Our truest glass, made by Times wrinckled hand.
We know wee're old, my days proclayme me so:
Fortie-fiue years, I Have gently ruld this Dukedom,
Pray heaven it be no fault,
For there is as much disease, though not to the eye,
In too much pity, as in Tyranny.

Your grace has spoke it right.

I know that life
Has not long course in me, twill not be long
Before I show that Kings have mortal bodies
As well as Subjects, therefore to my comfort,
And your succesfull hopes I have a Son
Whom I dare boast of; --

Whom we all do boast off,
A Prince elder in virtues then in years,

His judgment is a Father to his youth,

I, I, would he were from Court,

Our largest hopes grow in him,

And it is the greatest pity Noble Lord,
He is vntraueld,

It Is indeed my Lord.

Had he but travail to his time and Virtue -- oh he should near return again.


It shall be so, what is in hope begun,
Experience quickens, travail confirms the man,
Who Is else lives doubtful, and his days often sorye,
"Who Is rich in Knowledge, has the stock of glory.

Most true my royal Lord.

Some one attend our Son.

See, here he comes my Lord.

Oh you come well.

It Is always my desire my worthy Father.

Your Serious studyes, and those fruitful hours
That grow up into judgment, well become
Your birth, and all our loves: I weep that you are my son,
But Virtuously I weep, the more my gladness:
We have thought good and meet by the consent
Of these our Nobles, to move you toward Travail,
The better to approve you to your self
And give your apter power, foundation:
To see affections actually praesented,
Even by those men that owe them, yield more profit,
I more content, then singly to read of them,
"Since love or fear, make Writers partial,
The good and free example which you find,
In other Countries, match it with your own,
The ill to shame the ill, which will in time,
Fully instruct you how to set in frame,
A kingdom all in pieces.

Honored Father,
With care and duty I have listened to you,
What you desire, in me it is obedience,
I do obey in all, knowing for right,
"Experience is a Kingdoms better sight.

Oh it is the very luster of a Prince,
Travail! it is sweet and generous,

He that knows how to obey, knows how to reign
And that true knowledge have we found in you,
Make choice of your Attendants.

Their soon chose, only this man my Lord, a loving servant of mine.

What none but he?

I do entreat no more,
For that is the benefit a private Gentleman
Enioyes beyond our state, when he notes all,
Himself unnoted,
For should I bear the fashion of a prince,
I should then win more flattery, then profit,
And I should give them time and warning then
To hide their Actions from me, if I appear a Sun,
They Will run into the shade with their ill deeds,
And so prevent me.

A little too wise, a little too wise to live long.

You have answered us with wisdom, let it be.
Things private are best known through priuacy.

Stay you my elected servant.

My kind Lord.

The Duke my Father has a heavy burden,
Of years upon him.

My Lord it seems so, for they make him stoop.

Without dissemblance he is deep in age,
He bows unto his grave, I wonder much
Which of his wild Nobility it should be
(For none of his sad counsel has a voice in it)
Should so far travail into his consent,
To set me over into other Kingdoms.
Upon the stroke and minute of his death?

My Lord, it is easier to suspect them all,
Then truly to name one.

Since it is thus,
By absence, i will obey the Duke my father,
And yet not wrong my self.

Therein my Lord,
You might be happy twice.

So it shall be,
I Will stay at home, and travail;

Would your Grace
Could make that good.

I can, and indeed a Prince need no travail farther then his own Kingdom, if
he apply himself faythfullye, worthy the glory of himself and expectation
of others: and it would appear far nobler industry in him, to reform those
fashions that are already in his Country, then to bring new ones in, which
have neither true form nor fashion; to make his Court an Owl, City an Ape,
and the Country a Wolf, preying upon the ridiculous pride of either, and
therefore I hold it a safer stern upon this luckie advantage, since my father
is nere his setting, and I upon the Eastern hill to take my rise, to look into
the heart and bowels of this Dukedom, and in disguise, mark all abuses ready
for Reformation or Punishment


Give me but leave unfeignedly to admire you,
Your wisdom is so spacious and so honest,

So much have the complaints and suits of men, seven, nay seauenteene years
neglected, still interposd by coin and great enemies, preuaild with my pity,
that I cannot otherwise think but there are infectious dealings in most
offices, and foul mysteries throughout al Professions: and therefore I nothing
doubt but to find travail enough within my self, and Experience I fear too
much: nor will I be curious to fit my body to the humblest form and bearing,
so the labor may be fruitful: for how can abuses that keep low, come to the
right view of a Prince, unless his looks lie level with them, which else
will be longest hid from him, he shall be the last man sees 'em

For often between Kings Eyes, and subjects Crimes
Stands there a bar of brybes, the under office
Flatters him next above it: he the next,
And so of most, or many, Every Abuse will choose a brother,
It Is through the world, this Hand will rub the other.

You have set down the world briefly my Lord.

But how am I assured of faith in thee?
Yet I durst trust thee.

Let my soul be lost,
When it shall loose your secrets: nor will I only be a preserver of them,
but if you so please an assister


It suffices:
That King stands sur'st who by his virtue rises
More then by birth or blood, that Prince is rare,
Who strives in youth to save his age from care,
Let Us be preparde away.

I Will follow your Grace,
Thou wonder of all Princes, President, and Glory,
True Phoenix, made of an unusual strain,
"Who labors to reform is fit to reign.
How can that King be safe that studies not
The profit of his people? See where comes
The best part of my heart, my love.

Sir, I am bound to find you, I heard newly
Of sudden Travail which his grace intends
And only but your self to accompany him.

You heard in that, little beside the truth,
Yet not so sudden as to want those manners,
To leave you unregarded.

I did not think, so vnfashionably of you:
How long is your return?

It Is not yet come to me, scarce to my Lord,
Unless the Duke refer it to his pleasure,
But long I think it is not, the Dukes age,
(If not his apt experience) will forbid it.

His grace commands, I must not think amiss, farewell

Nay stay, and take this comfort,
You shall hear often from us, i will direct
Where you shall surely know, and I desire you
Write me the Truth, how my new father in law, the
Captain bears himself toward my Mother,
For that marriage, knew nothing of my mind,
It never flourisht in any part of my affection.

Me thinks sha's much disgraced herself.

Nothing so: if he be good and will abide the touch, a Captain may marry a
Lady, if he can sail into her good will


Indeed that's all,

It Is al in all, commend me to thy breast, farwell.
So by my Lords firm policy we may see,
To present view, what absent forms would be.

There Is Noble purchase Captain.

Nay admirable purchase.

Enough to make us proud for ever.

Hah?

Never was opportunity so Gallant.

Why you make me mad.

Three Ships not a poope less.

And euerieone so wealthily burdned upon my manhood.


Pox on it, and now am I tied even as the Devil would have it.


Captain, of all men living I would have sworn thou would nere have married.


S'foot, so would I my self man, give me my Due, you know I ha sworn all
heaven over and over


That you have y faith.

Why go too then.

Of a man that has tasted salt water to commit such a fresh Trick.


Why it is abominable I grant you now I see it:

Had there been fewer Women --

And among those Women fewer Drabs --

And among those Drabs fewer pleasing --

Then t'ad been something:

But when there are more women, more common pretty sweet hearts, then ever any
age could boast off


And I to play the Artificer and marry: to have my wife dance at home, and my
Ship at Sea, and both take in salt water together: oh Leiftenant you are
happy, thou keepst a Wench


I hope I am happyer then so Captain, for a my Troth she keeps me.


How? is there any such fortunate man breathing? and I so miserable to live
honest? I envy thee Lieutenant, I envy thee, that thou art such a happy
Knave, here is my hand among you, share it equally, I Will to sea with you


There spoke a Noble Captain.

Lets hear from you, there will be news shortly.

Doubt it not Captain.

What lustful passion came aboard of me, that I should marrye, was I drunk?
yet that cannot altogether hold, for it was four a clock 'ith morning, had
it been five, I would ha sworn it: that a man is in danger every minute to
be cast away, without he have an extraordinary Pilot that can perform more
then a man can do: and to say truth too, when 'ime abroad what can I do at
home? no man living can reach so far: and what a horrible thing it would be
to have horns brought me at Sea, to look as if the Devil were 'ith ship: and
all the great Tempests would be thought of my Raising, to be the general
curse of all Merchants: and yet they likely are as deep in as my self, and
that's a comfort: O that a Captain should live to be married! nay, I that have
been such a Gallant salt-theefe, should yet live to be married: What a
fortunate Elder Brother is he, whose father being a Ramish Plough-man, himself
a perfumde Gentleman, spending the laboring reeke from his Fathers: Nosthrils
in Tobacco: the sweat of his Fathers body in monthlye Phisickc for his pretty
quesie Harlot: he sowes a pace 'ith Country: the Tailor oretakes him in the
City, so that often times before the Corn comes to Earning, it is up to the
ears in high Collars, and so at every harvest the Reapers take pains for the
Mercers, ha! why this is stirring happiness indeed, would my father had held
a plow so, and fed upon squeaz'd Curds and Onions, that I might have bathed
insensualitie: but he was too ruttish himself to let me thrive under him,
cansumde me before he got me, and that makes me so wretched, now to be
shackled with a wife, and not greatly rich neither


Captain, my Husband.

S'life call me husband again, and i will play the Captain and beat you.

What has disturbed you sir, that you now look so like an Enemy upon me?


Go make a Widdower, hang thy self,
How comes it that you are so opposite
To love and kindenes? I deserve more Respect,
But that you please to be forgetful of it.

For love to you, did I neglect my state,
Chide better fortunes from me,
Gave the world talk, laid all my friends at waste.

The more fool you, could you like none but me?
Could none but I supplye you?
I am sure you were sued to* by far worthyer men,
Deeper in wealth and Gentry.
What could thou see in me, to make thee doat so on me,
If I know, I am a Villain: what a torments this? why did thou marry me?
you think as most of your insatiate Widows, that Captains can do wonders,
when 'lasse the name does often prove the better man


That which you urge, should rather give me cause to repent then your self.


Then to that end I do it.

What a miserable state am I led into?

How now sir?

Count Proditer is now alighted.

What, my Lord: I must make much of him, heel one day write me Cuckold: it is
good to make much of such a man, even to my face, he plyes it hard I thank
him: --

what, my worthy Lord!


I Will come to you in order Captain.

Oh that's in order: a kiss is the Gammoth to pricksong.

Let me salute you Captain.

My dear esteemed Count, I have a life for you:

Hear you the news?

What may it be my Lord?

My Lord, the Dukes Son is upon his travail to several Kingdoms.


May it be possible my Lord, and yet so little rumord?


Take It of my Truth, nay, twa's well managed, things are as they are handled:
but all my care is still, pray heaven he return safe, without danger Captain


Why, is there any doubt to be had of that my Lord?

I by my faith Captain.
Princes have private enemies, and great:
Put case a man should grudge him, for his Virtues:
Or envy him, for his wisdom: why you know
This makes him lie bare brested to his foe.

That Is full of certainty my Lord, but who be his Attendants?

Thence Captain comes the fear, but singlie attended neither (my best
gladness) only by your Son in Law Fidelio


Is it to be believed? I promise you my Lord then I begin to fear him my
self, that fellow will undo him: I durst undertake to corrupt him with twelve
pence over and above, and that's a small matter: has a whorish Conscience,
he is an inseparable Knave, and I could near speak well of that fellow


All we of the younger house, I can tell you do doubt him much, -- the Ladies
remoou'd, shall we have your sweet soscietie Captain


Though it be in mine own house, I desire I may follow your Lordship.


I love to avoid strife,
Not many months Phoenix shall keep his life.

So, his way is in, he knows it,
We must not be discourteous to a Lord,
Warn him our house it were vilde: his presence is an honor, if he lie with
our wives, it is for our credit, we shall be the better trusted, it is a sign
we shall live ith world: O Tempests and Whirlewinds (who but that man whom the
forefinger cannot daunt, that makes his shame his living:) Who but that man I
say, could endure to be thoroughly married? Nothing but a divorce can relieve
me: any way to be rid of her would rid my torment: if all means fail I Will kill,
or poison her, and purge my fault at sea: but first I Will make gentle Try of a
Divorce: But how shall I accuse her subtle honesty? I Will attach this Lords
coming to her, take hold of that: ask counsel: and now I remember, I have
acquaintance with an old crafty Client, who by the puzzle of suites and
shifting of Courts, has more tricks and starting holes, then the dizzie pates
of fifteen Atturneys: one that has been muzled in Law like a Bear, and lead
by the Ring of his spectacles from office to office: him I Will seek out with
haste, all paths I Will tread

All deaths I Will die ere I die married.

Puh, you do resist me hardly.

I beseech your Lordship cease in this,
It Is never to be granted: if you come as a friend unto my honor and my
husband, you shall be ever welcome, if not, I must entreat it --


Why assure your self, Madame, it is not the fashion.

It Is more my grief my Lord, such as my self are judged the worse for such.


Faith y' are too nice, you will see me kindly forth:

And honorably welcome.

Gentlemen, y' are most neately welcome.

Y' are very cleanelye Sir, prithee have a care to our Geldings.

Your Geldings shall be well considered.

Considered?

Sirrah, what Guess does this Inn hold now?

Some five and twenty Gentlemen besides their beasts.

Their Beasts?

Their wenches I mean sir, for your worship I nowes those that are vdder men
are beasts


How does your Mother sit?

Very well in health I thank you heartily sir.

And so is my Mare y faith.

I Will do her commendations indeed sir.

Well kept up Shuttle-cocke:

But what old fellow was he that newly alighted before us?

Who he? as arrant a crafty fellow as ere made water on horseback: some say
he is as good as a Lawyer, (marry 'ime sure he is as bad as a Knave) if you
have any suites in law, he is the fittest man for your company: has been
so* toward and lug'd himself* that he is able to affoo^d you more knauish
counsel for ten groates, then another for ten shillings


A fine fellow: but do you know him to be a Knave, and will lodge him.


Your worship begins to talk idly, your bed shall be made presently; if we
should not lodge knaves, I wonder how we should be able to live honestlye, are
there honest men enough think you in a Term time to fill all the Innes in the
town, and as far as I can see* a knaves Gelding eats no more hay then an
honest man's: nay thieves Gelding eats less, i will stand to it, his Master
allows him a better Ordnarie: yet I have my eightpe^ce day and night, twere
more for our profit I wus, you were all thieves, if you were so contented: I
shall be called for: give your worships good morrow


A royal knave y faith: we have happened into a Godly Inn.

Assure you my L. they belong al to one church.

This should be some old busy turbulent fellow: villainous Law-worme, that
eats holes into poor men's causes


May it please your worship to give me leave?

I give you leave sir, you have your Veniam, now fill me a brown Toste sirrah.


Will you have no drink to it sir?

Is that a question in law?

Yes, in the lowest Court: 'ith Sellor sir.

Let me haa't removed presently sir.

It shall be done sir.

Now as you were saying Sir, i will come to you immediately too.


Oh very well sir:

I Am a little busy sir,

But as how sir?

I pray sir?

Has brought me into the Court, marry my adversary has not declarde yet.

Non declarauit Aduersarius say thou: what a Villain's that, I have a trick
to do thee good: I will get thee out a Proxe, and make him declare with a Pox
to him


That will make him declare to his fore grief, I thank your good worship: but
put case he do declare

Si declarasset, If he should declare there,

I would be loath to stand out to the judgment of that Court

Non ad iudicium, do you fear corruption? then i will relieve you agaen: you
shall get a Supers^diae, Non molest andam; and (...) it big her


Very good.

Now if it should ever come to a Testificandum, what be his witnesses?


I little fear his witnesses.

Non metuis testes? more valiant man then Orestes

Please you sir to dissolve this into Wine, Ale, or Beer, I come a hundred
mile to you I protest, and leave all other counsel behind me


Nay you shall always find me a sound Card, I stood not ath Pillorie for
nothing in eighty eight, all the world knows that: now let me dispatch you
sir; I come to you Presenter


Faith the party has removed both body and cause with a habeas corpus.

Has he that knauerie? But has he put in bail above can tell?


That I can assure your worship, he has not.

Why then thy best course shall be, to lay out more money, take out a
Procedendo, and bring down the cause and him with a Vengeance


Then he will come indeed

As for the other party, let the Audita querela alone, take me out a special
Supplicauit, which will cost you enough, and then you pepper him. For the first
party after the Procedendo you will get costs, the cause being sound, you will have
a Judgment, Nunc pro Tunc, you will get a Venire facies to warn your Jury, a
December tales to fill up the number, and a Capias vt Legatum for your execution


I thank you my learned counsel.

What a busy Caterpiller's this? let us accost him in that manner.


Content my Lord.

O my old admirable fellow, how have I all this while thirsted to salute thee?
I knew thee in Octauo of the Duke. --


In Octauo of the Duke: I remember the year well.

Bi^h mass a lusty proper man.

Oh was I?

But still in law*

Still in Law. I had not breathed else now, it is very marrow, very manna to me
to be in law: i would been dead ere this else: I have found such sweet pleasure in
the vexation of others, that I could wish my years over and over again, to see
that fellow a Beggar, that bawling Knave a Gentleman: a matter brough^ 'een to
a judgment to day, as far as ere it was to begin again to morrow: O Raptures I
here a writ of Demur, there a Procedendo, here a Sui surrara, there a
Capiendo, Tricks, Delays* Money-lawes


Is it possible old Lad?

I have been a Tearme-trotter my self any time this five and forty years,
a goodly time and a gracious: in which space I ha been at least sixteen times
beggard, and got up again: and in the mire again, that I have stunke again, and
yet got up again


And so clean and handsome how?

You see it apparently* I cannot hide it from you: nay more, in foelice hora
be it spoken, you see i am old, yet have I at this present, nine and twenty
suits in Law


Deliver us man!

And all not worth forthy shillings.

May it (...) cu'd?

The pleasure of a man is all.

An old fellow and such a stinger.

A stake pulled out of my hedge, there is one: I was well beaten I remember, that is
two: I took one a bed with my wife again her will, that is three: I was called
cuckold for my labor* that is four: I took another a bed again, that is five
the^ one called me wittal that is six: he killed my Dog for Barking, sea^en: my
Maid Servant was knocked at that time, eight: my wife miscarryed with a push,
Nine, and sic de coeteris, I have so vexed and beggerd the whole parish, with
process, Suppoeneas, and such like molestations, they are not able to spare so
much ready money from a Term, as would set up a new Weather-cocke: the
Churchwardens are feign to go to law with the Poores money


Fie, fie.

And I so fetch up all the men every Term time that it is impossible to be at
civil cuckoldry, within our selves, unless the whole country rise upon our
wives


A my faith a pretty policy.

Nay an excellent stratagem: but of all I most wonder at the continual
substance of thy wit, that having had so many suits in law from time to time,
thou have still money to relieve 'em


Has the best fortune for that, I never knew him without.

Why do you so much wonder at that? why this is my course: my Mare and I come
up some five days before a Term


A good Decorum.

Here I Lodge as you see amongst Innes, and places of most receipt --


Very wittily.

By which advantage I diue into Country men's causes, furnish 'em with knauish
counsel, little to their profit, buzzing into their Ears, this course, that
writ, this office, that Vltimum refugium, as you know I have words enough for the
purpose


Enough a conscience y faith.

Enough a law, no matter for conscience. For which busy and laborious sweating
courtesy, they cannot choose but feed me with money, by which I maintain mine
own suits: ho, ho, ho


Why let me hug thee, Caper in mine arms.

Another special trick I have, no body must know it, which is, to prefer most
of those men to one Attorney whom I affect best, to answer which kindness of
mine, he will sweat the better in my cause, and do them the less good, take it
of my word, I helped my Attorney to more Clients the last Term then he will
dispatch all his life time: I did it


What a noble memorable deed was there?

Sir.

Now sir.

There Is a kind of captain, very robustiously enquires for you.


For me? a man of war: a man of law is fit for a man of war: we have no
leisure to say prayers: we both kill a Sunday mornings: I Will not be long from
your sweet company


O no I beseech you.

What captain might this be?

Thou Angel sent amongst us, sober Law.
Made with meek Eyes, persuading Action,
No loud immodest Tongue, voic'd like a virgin,
And as chaste from sale,
Save only to be heard, but not to rail.
How has abuse deformed thee to all Eyes?
That where thy virtues sat, thy vices rise,
Yet why so rashly for one villains fault*
Do I arraigne whole man? Admired Law,
Thy upper parts must needs be sacred, pure,
And incorruptible, they are grave and wise,
It Is but the dross beneath 'em, and the clouds
That get between thy glory and their praise,
That make the visible and foul Eclipse,
For those that are near to thee, are upright,
As noble in their conscience, as their birth,
Know that damnation is in every bribe,
And rarely put it from 'em: rate the Presenters,
And scourge 'em with five years imprisonment,
For off ring but to tempt 'em.
Thus is true justice exercisde and used,
"Woe to the giver when the Bribe's refusde.
It Is not their will, to have law worse then war,
Where still the poor'st die first,
To send a man without a sheet to his grave,
Or bury him in his Papers.
It Is not their mind it should be, nor to have
A suit hang longer then a man in chains
Let him be nere so fastened, they least know
That are above, the tedious steps below.
I thank my time, I do.

I long to know what captain this should be:

See where the Bane or every cause Returns.

S'foote it is the captain my father in law, my L.

Take heed.

The Divorce shall rest then, and the five hundred crowns shall stand in full
force and virtue


Then do you wisely Captain.

A way sail I, fare thee well.

A lusty crack or wind go with thee.

But ah!

Hah:

Remember a Scriuener

I Will have him for thee. Why thus am I sought after by all professions; here is a
weather beaten Captain, who not long since new married to a Lady widow,
would now feign have sued a Divorce between her and him, but that her honesty
is his only hinderance: to be rid of which, he does determine to turn her
into white money, and there is a Lord his Chapman has bid five hundred Crowns
for her already


How?

Or for his part, or whole in her.

Why, do she ^eaue to sell his wife?

His wife? I bith mass, he would sell his soul if he knew what Merchant would
lay out money vppon't, and some of 'em have need of one they swear so fast


Why, I never heard of the like.

Non audiuisti, didstnere here of that trick? why Pistor a Baker sold his
wife the other day to a cheesemonger, that made Cake and Cheese: another to a
Coferer: a third to a common player: why you see it is common: nere fear the
Captain, be has not so much wit to be a praesident himself: I promisd to
furnish him with an odd Scriuener of mine own* to draw the bargain, and sale
of his Lady, your horses stand here Gentleman


I, I, I.

I shall be busilye plunged till toward bed time, above the chin in profundis.


What monstrous days are these?
Not only to be vicious, most men study,
But in it to be ugly, strive to exceed,
Each other in the most deformed deed.

Was this her private choice? did she neglect
The presence and opinion of her friends, for this?

I wonder who that one should be,
Should so disgrace that Reverend Name of Lord,
So loathsomly to buy Adultery?

We may make means to know.

Take courage man, we will beget some defense.

I am bound by nature.

I by Conscience -- To sell his Lady: indeed she was a Beast to marry him, and
so he makes of her, come, i will through now 'ime entered


Is my sweet Knight coming, are you certain he is coming?


Certain for sooth, I am sure I saw him out of the Barbers shop, ere I would
come away


A Barbers shop, O he is a trim Knight, would he venture his body into a
Barbers shop, when he knows it is as dangerous as a piece of Ireland: O yonder,
yonder, he comes, get you back again, and look you say as I aduiz'de you


You know me mistress?

My mask, my mask.

My sweet Reuenewe!

My pleasure welcome: I have got single, none but you shall accompany me to
the Justice of peace my Fathers


Why, is thy Father Justice of Peace, and I not know it?


My father! in faith sir I, simply tho I stand here a Citizens wife: I am a
Justice of Peaces Daughter


I love thee the better for thy birth.

He Is at thy service my sweet Reuenewe, for thy money paid for them.


Why then let him run a little before I beseech thee, for a my troth he will
discover us else


He shall obey thee, before sirrah* trudge: but do you mean to lie at your
Fathers all night


Why should I desire your company else?


S'foot where shall I lie then.


What an idle question's that? why do you hinke I cannot make room for you in
my Fathers house, as well as in my husbands, they are both good for nothing else


A man so resolute in valor as a Woman in desire, were an absolute Leader.


May it plese your good worship master Justice.


Please me and please are your self,
That's my word.

The party your worship sent for, will by no means be brought to appear.


He will not, then what would you aduize me to do therein?


Only to grant your worships warrant, which is of sufficient force to compel
him


No by my faith: you shall not have me in that Trap: am I sworn Justice of
Peace, and shall I give my warrant to fetch a man against his will? why there
the peace is Broken, we must do all quietly, if he come he is welcome, and
as far as I can seeyet, he is a fool to be absent, I by this gold is he
(which he gave me this morning


Why, but may it please your good worship. --


I say again please me and please your self, that's my word still.


Sir, the world esteems it a Common favor, upon the Contempt of the party,
the justice to grant his warrant


I, it is so common, it is the worse again, twere the better for me twere otherwise.


I protest sir, and this Gentleman can say as much, it lies upon my half
undoing


I cannot see yet, that it should be so -- I see not a cross yet.


I beseech your worship show me your immediate favor, and accept this small
trifle but as a remembrance to my succeeding Thankfulness


Angels? i will not meddle with them, you give them to my wife not to me.


I, I sir.


But I pray tell me now, did the party Vina Voce, with his own mouth
deliver that contempt, that that he would not appear, or did you but iestint


Iest^ no a my troth sir, such was his insolent answer

And do you think it stood with my credit to put up such an abuse? will he
not appear says he? I Will make him appear with a Vengeance Latronello


Does your worship call?


Draw me a strong limbd warrant for the Gentleman speedily, he will be
bountiful to thee: go and thank him within


I shall know your worship hereafter.


I, I prithee do. Two Angels one party, four another: and I think it a
great spark of wisdom and policy (if a man come to me for Justice) first to
know his greefes by his fees, which be light and which be he ^ie: he may
cou^terfet else, and make me do Justice for nothing: I like not that* for when I
mean to be just, let me be paid well for it: the deed so rare, purges the
bribe: how now, what is the news thou art come so hastily? how fares my
Knightly Brother


Troth he nere farde worse in his life sir: he nere had less stomach to his
meat since I knew him


Why sir?


Indeed he is dead sir.


How sir?


Newly deceasd I can assure your Worship: the Tabacco-pipe new dropped out of his
mouth before I took horse, a shrewd sign: I knew then there was no way but
one with him, the poor pipe was the last man he took leave off in this world,
who sell in three pieces before him, and seemed to mourn inwardly, for it looked
as blacke'th mouth as my master


Would he die so like a Politician, and not once write his mind to me?


No I Will say that for him sir: he dyed in the perfect state of memory, made
your worship his full and whole executor: bequeathing his Daughter, and with her
all his wealth, only to your disposition


Did he make such a godly end say thou? did he die so comfortably, and
bequeath all to me


Your niece is at hand sir, the will, and the witnesses.

What a precious joy and comfort's this, that a Justices brother can die so
well, nay in such a good and happy memory, to make me full executor. Well he
was too honest to live, and that made him die so soon: now I beshrew my heart,
I am glad he is in heaven, has left all his cares and troubles with me, and
that great vexation of telling of Money, yet I hope he had so much grace
before he died to turn his white money into gold, a great ease to his Executor


See here comes your Niece my young mistress sir,

Ah my sweet Niece, let me kiss thee, and drop a tear between thy lips: one
tear from an old man is a great matter, the cocks of age are dry, thou have
lost a virtuous father, to gain a notable uncle


My hopes now rest in you next under heaven

Let 'em rest, let 'em rest.

Sir?

You Are most welcome ere ye begin sir.

We are both led by oath and dreadful promise,
Made to the dying man at his last sense,
First to deliver these into your hands,
The suerties and reuealers of his state.

Good.

With this his only daughter and your Niece,
Whose fortunes are at your disposing set,
Uncle and father are in you both met.

Good in faith, a well spoken Gentleman, you are not an Esquire sir?


Not sir.

Not sir? more's the pity: by my faith better men then you are, but a great
many worse: you see I have been a Scholar in my time, tho I Am a Justice
now: Niece you are most happily welcome, the charge of you is wholly and soly mine
own: and since you are so fortunately come Niece, I Will rest a perpetual
widower


I take the meaning chaster then the words:
Yet I hope well of both, since it is thus,
His phraise off ends least that is known humourous.

I make my brother (says he) full and whole Executor, honestly done of him
in faith, seldom can a man get such a brother: and here again says he, very
virtuously, I bequeath all to him and his disposing: an excellent fellow a my
troth, would you might all die no worse, Gentlemen


But as much better as might be.

Bless your uprightness master Justice,

You Are most soberly welcome sir: daughter you have that ye kneel for, rise,
salute your weeping coozen


Weeping coozen?

I coozen.

Eye to weeping is very proper, and so is the party that spoke it believe me,
a pretty, fine, slender, straight, delicate knit body

Oh how it moves a pleasure through our senses!
How small are women's wastes to their expenses?
I cannot see her face, that is under water yet.

News as cold to the heart as an old man's kindness: my uncle dead?


I have lost the dearest Father.

If she marry by your consent, choice and liking make her dowry five thousand
crowns: hum, five thousand crowns? therefore by my consent she shall nere
marry, I will neither choose for her, like of it, nor consent to it


Now by the pleasure of my blood a pretty coozen: I would not care, if I were
as nere kin to her, as I have been to her kinswoman


Daughter, what Gentleman might this be?

No Gentleman sir, he is a Knight.

Is he but a knight? troth, I would a sworn had been a Gentleman, to see, to
see, to see


He Is my husbands own brother, I can tell you (sir:

Thy husbands brother: speak certainly prithee.

I can assure you father, my husband and he has lain both in one belly.


I Will swear then he is his brother indeed, and by the surer side: I crave
hearty pardon sweet kinsman that thou have stood so long unsaluted in the way
of kindred

Welcome to my board: I have a bed for thee,
My daughters husbands brother shall command,
Keys of my Chests and Chambers. -- I have stable for thy horse, chamber for
thy self, and a loft abou for thy lowzie lackie, all fit, away with
handkirchers, dry up eyes, at funeral we must cry: now let us be wise


I told you his affection.

It falls sweetly.

But here I bar you from all plots to night,
The time is yet too heavy to be light.

Why, I Am content, i will sleep as chaste as you,
And wager night by night who keeps most true.

Well we shall see your temper.

Fear not me Fidelio: become you that invisible Rope-maker the Scriuener, that
binds a man as he walks yet all his joints at liberty, as well as i will fit that
common folly of Gentry, the easie-affecting venturer, and no doubt our purpose
will arrive most happily


Chaste duty my Lord works powerfully in me, and rather then the poor Lady
my mother should fall upon the common side of rumor to beggar her name, I
would not only undergo all habits, offices, disguised professions, tho even
opposite to the temper my blood holds: but in the stainlesse quarrel of her
reputation, alter my shape for ever


I love thee wealthier, thou have a noble touch, and by this means which is the
only safe means to preserve thy mother from such an ugly land and sea monster
as a counterfeit Captain is, he resigning and basely selling all his estate,
title, right, and interest in his Lady, as the form of the writing shall
testify

What otherwise can follow but to have,
A Lady safe delivered of a knave?

I am in debt my life, to the free goodness of your inventions.


Oh they must ever strive to be so good,
"Who sels his vow is stamped the slave of blood.

Away.

Captain, my husband.

Hence, we are at a price for thee, at a price, wants but the telling, and the
sealing, then --


Have you no sense, neither of my good name or your own credit?


Credit? pox of credit, that makes me owe so much: it had bine better for me by
a thousand Royals I had lost my credit, seven year ago, t'as undone me,
that is it that makes me fly: what need I to sea else, in the Spring time,
when Woods have leaves, to look upon balde Oak

Happier that man say I, whom no man trusts,
It makes him valiant, dares outface the prisons,
Upon whose carcass no Gownde Raven iets,
Oh he that has no credit owes no debts.
It Is time I were rid on it.

Oh why do you so wilfully cherrish your own poison? and breath against the
best of life, chaste credit

Well may I call it chaste, for like a Maid
Once falsely broke it ever lives decaide.
O Captain, husband, you name that Dishonest,
By whose good power all that are honest live,
What madness is it to speak ill of that,
Which makes all men speak well, take away credit
By which men amongst men, are well reputed,
That man may live, but still lives executed.
Oh then show pity to that noble Title
Which else you do Usurp: you are no true Captain,
To let your enemies lead you, foul disdain,
And everlasting Scandal, Oh believe it!
The money you receive for my good name
Will not be half enough to pay your shame.

No, i will sell thee then to the Smock: see here comes my honorable Chapman.


Oh my poison!
Him, whom mine honor and mine eye abhors.

Lady, what so vniouially departed?

Fine she policy? she makes my back her Bolster, but before my face, she
not indures him, Tricks


Captain, how haps it she removed so strangely?


Oh for Modesties cause awhile my Lord: she must restrain her self, she is
not yours yet

Beside, it wear not wisdom to appear,
Easy before my sight, fah, wherefore serves modesty but to pleasure a Lady
now and then, and help her from susspect, that is the best use it is put too


Well observed of a Captain.

No doubt you will be soon friends my Lord.

I think no less.

And make what have I can to my ship, I durst wager you will be under sail before
me


A pleasant voyage Captain.

I, a very pleasant voyage as can be: I see the hour is Ripe, here comes the
Prisons Bawd the bond-maker, one that binds heirs before they are begot


And here are the Crowns Captain, go? attend,
Let our bay Courser wait.

It shall be obeyed.

A Farmers son, is it true?

Has crowns to scatter?

I give you your salute sir.

I take it not unthankfully sir.

I hear a good report of you sir -- you have money.

I have so, true.

An excellent virtue.

I, to keeep from you -- hear you me Captain?
I have a certain generous itch sir, to loose a few Angels in the way of
profit: it is but a game at Tennis

Where if the ship keep above line, it is three to one:
If not, there is but three hundred Angels gone.

Is your venture three hundred? you are very pretiously welcome: here is a
voyage toward will make us all. --


Beggarly fools, and swarming knaves.


Captain, what is he?

Fear him not my Lord, he is a Gull', he ventures with me, some filthy
Farmers son, the father's a Jew, and the son a Gentleman:pha. --


Yet he should be a Jew too, for he is new come from giving over swine.


Why, that in our Country makes him a Gentleman.

Go to, tell your money Captain.

Read aloft Scriuener. 1.2. --

To all good and honest Christian people, to who^ this present writing shall
come: know you for a certain, that I Captain, for and in the consideration of
the sum of five hundred crowns, have clearly bargained, sold, given,
granted, assigned and set over, and by these presents do clearly bargain,
sell, give, grant, assign and set over, all the right, estate, title,
interest, demand, possession, and term of years to come, which I the said
Captain have, or ought to have. --


If I were as good as I should be, --

In and to Madona Castiza, my most virtuous, modest, loving, and obedient wife.
--


By my troth my Lord and so she is. -- 3.4.5.6.7.

The more Slave he that says it, and not sees it.

Together, with all and singular those admirable qualities with which her noble
breast is furnished


Well said Scriuener, have put'em all in: you shall hear now my L.


In primis, the beuties of her mind, chastity, temperance, and above all,
patience

You have bought a Jewel in faith, my L, nine and thirty, forty.

Excellent in the best of Music, in voice delicious: in conference wise and
pleasing: of age contentful: neither too yo^g to be a pish, nor too old to be
sottis


You have bought as lovely a penny-woorth my Lord, as ere you bought in your
life


Why should I buy her else Captain?

And which is the best, of a wife a most comfortable sweet companion.


I could not afford her so y faith, but that I am-going to sea and have need
of money


A most comfortable sweet companion.

What again? the Scriuener reads in passion.

I read as the words move me: yet if that be a faul it shall be seen no more,
-- which said Madona Casti^^a lying, and yet being in the occupatio^ of the
said captai


Ninteene -- occupation? Pox out, out with occupation, a Captain is of no
occupation, man


Nor thou of no religion.

Now I come to the Habendum, to have and to hold, use and --


Use? put out use too for shame.
Till we are all gone, I prithee.

And to be acquitted of and from all former bargains, former sales:


Former sails, nine and twenty thirty, by my troth my Lord, this is the first
time that ever I sold her


Yet the writing must run so Captain.

Let it run on then, nine and forty, fifty, --

Former sales, Guiftes, Grants, Surrenders. Reentryes. --

For Reentryes, I will not swear for her.

And furdermore (I the said) of and for the consideration of the sum of five
hundred Crowns to set me a board before these presents utterly disclaim for
ever, any Title, estate, right, interest, demand, or possession, in or to the
said Madona Castiza, my late virtuous, and unfortunate wife


Unfortunate indeed, that was well placed.

As also neither to touch, attempt, molest, or incumber any part, or parts
whatsoever: either to be namde or not to be namde: either hidden or vnhidden,
either those that boldly look abroad, or those that dare not show their face


Faces: I know what you mean by faces: Scriuener, there is a great figure in
faces


In witness whereof, I the said Captain have interchangeably set to my hand
and seal: in presence of all these, the day and date above written


Very good sir, I Will be ready for you presently, four hundred and twenty.
1.2.3.4.5. --


Of all deeds, yet this strikes the deepest wound
Into my apprehension,
Reverend, and honorable Matrimony,
Mother of lawful sweetes, vnshamed mornings:
Dangerlesse pleasures, thou that make the bed,
Both pleasant, and legitimately fruitful: without thee,
All the whole world were soyled Bastardy.
Thou art the only and the greatest form.
That put'st a difference between our desires
And the disordered appetites of Beasts,
Making their mates, those that stand next their lusts.
Then, -- with what base injury is thy goodness paid
First, rare to have a Bride commence a Maid,
But does beguile joy of the purity:
And is made strickt by power of Drugs and Art,
An Artificall Maid, a Doctord Virgin,
And so deiceues the glory of his bod:
A foul contempt, against the spotless power
Of sacred wedlock, but if chaste and honest,
There is another Devil hauntes marriage,
(None fondly loves but knows it) Jealousy,
That Wedlocks yellow sickness, that whispering separation every minute.
And thus the curse takes his effect or progress,
The most of men in their first sudden furyes,
Rail at the narrow bounds of marriage,
And cal't a prison then it is most just,
That the disease'ath prison, Jealousy
Should still affect a'm, but oh! here I am fixed,
To make sale of a wife, monstrous and foul,
An act abhord in nature, could in soul:
Who that has man in him, could so resign,
To make his shame, the poesye to the Coin?

Right in faith, my Lord fully five hundred,

I said how you should find it Captain, and with this competent sum you
rest amplye contented


Amply contented.

Here Is the Pen Captain: your name to the sale.

S'foote do take me to be a penman? I protest I could nere write more then
A, B, C, those three letters in my life


Why those will serve Captain.

I could nere get further.

Would you have got further then A B C? ah Base Captain, that is far enough
in faith


Take the Seal off Captain.

It goes on hardly, and comes off easily.

I just like a Coward.

Will you write witness Gentleman?

He? he shall, prithee come and set thy hand for witness Rogue, thou shall
venture with me


Nay, then I ha reason Captain that commands me?


What a fair fist the pretty whorsone writes, as if he had had manners and
bringing up, a farmers Son: his Father dam's himself to sell mustie Corn,
while he ventures the Money, twill prosper well at Sea no doubt he shall nere
see it agei


So, Captain you deliver this as your deed.

As my deed, what else sir?

The ouglyest deed that ere mine eye did witness

So my Lord, you have her, clip her, enjoy her, she is your own, and let me be
proud to tell you now my Lord, she is as good a soul if a man had a mind to
live honest, and keep a wench, the Kindest, sweetest, comfortablest Rogue. --


Hark in thine ear,
The Baser slave art thou: and so i will tell her,
I love the Pearl, thou soldst, hate thee the Seller --
Go, to Sea, the end of thee -- is Lousy.

This fine work: a very brave end, hum --

Well thought upon, this Scriuener may furnish me

Why should this fellow be a Lord by birth?
Being by blood a Knave, one that would sell
His Lordship if he likt her Ladyship.

Yes my Lord.

What Is here Now?

I have employment for a trusty fellow, bold, sure --

What if he be a Knave my Lord?

There thou comst to me, why he should be so, and men of your quill are not
unacquainted


Indeed al our chief living my Lord, is by fools and knaves, we could not
keep open shop else* Fools that enter into bonds, and Knaves that bind them


Why now we meet.

And as my memory happily leads me: I know a fellow of a standing estate,
never flowing: I durst convey treason into his bosom

And keep it safe nine years.

A goodly Time.

And if need were would press to an attempt,
And cleave to Desperate action.

That Last fits me.
Thou have the measure right, look I hear from thee.

With duteous speed.

Expect a large reward:
I will find time of her to find regard.

The end of me is lowzie.

Oh my Lord! I have strange words to tell you.

Stranger yet? i will choose some other hour to listen to thee, I am yet sick of
this, discover quickly


Why, will you make yourselfe known my Lord

I.
Who scourges sin let him do it dreadfully.

Pox of his dissemblance: I will to s^n.

Nay, you shall to sea, thou would poison the whole land else -- why how now
Captain


In health.

What, drooping?

Or a shamde of the sale of thine own wife?

You might count me an ass then in faith.

If not a shamed of that, what can you be a shamd ofthen?

Prithee ha done, I am ashamed of nothing.

I easily believe that.

This Lord sticks in my stomach.

How? take one of thy feathers down, and fetch him up.

I Would make him come.

But what if the Duke should hear of this?

I, or your Son in Law, Fidelio knows of the sale of his mother.


What and they did, I sell none but mine own: as for the Duke, he is abroad by
this time, and for Fidelio he is in labor


He, in labor?

What call you Traveling?

That Is true: -- but let me tell you Captain: whether the Duke hear on it, or
Fidelio know on it: or both, or neither, twa's a most filthy loathsome part


A base unnatural deed --

Slave and fool: -- ha, who? oh --

Thou hateful villain: thou should choose (to sincke
To keep thy baseness shrouded.

Ougly wretch.

Who has laid violence upon my husband?
My dear sweet Captain, help --

Lady you wrong your value,
Call you him dear that has sold you so cheap?

I do beseech your pardon good my Lord.

Rise.

My abused Mother:

My kind Son,
Whose liking I neglected in this match.

Not that alone, but you far happyer fortunes.

Is this the Scriuener and the Farmers Son,
Fire on his Lordship he told me they Trauaild.

And see the sum told out to buy that Jewel
More precious in a Woman then her eye, her honor:
Nay take it to you Lady, and liudge it,
Too slight a recompense, for your great wrong, but that his riddance helps it.


S'foot he undoes me, I am a Rogue and a Beggar,
The Aegiptian plague creepes over me already,
I begin to be lousy.

Thus happily prevented, you are set free,
Or else made over to adultery.

To heaven and to you my modest thanks.

Monster, to sea, spit thy al herred foame,
Where it may do least harm, there is air and roeme.
Thour't Dangerous in a Chamber, Virulext Venem,
Unto a Ladies name, and her chaste breath
If past this euenings verge, the Dukedom hold thee,
Thou art reserved for abject punishment.

I do beseech your good Lordship consider the state of a poor downe-cast
Captain


Captain, off with that noble title thou becomst it vildely, I nere saw the
name fit worse, i will sooner allow a Pandar a Captain then thee


More's the pity.

Sue to thy Lady for pardon.

I give it without suite.

I do beseech your Ladyship not so much for pardon, as to bestow a few of those
Crowns upon a poor vnfethered Rouer that will as truly pray for you, and
wish you hanged, as any man breathing


I give it freely all.

Nay by your favor:
I will contain you Lady, here* be gone:
Use slaves like slaves -- wealth keeps their faults unknown.

Well 'ime yet glad, i have liberty and these:
The Land has plagued me, and i will plague the seas.

The Scene is cleared, the bane of brightness fled
Who sought the death of honor, is struck dead.
Come modest Lady:

My most honest mother.

Thy virtue shall live safe from reach of shames,
That Act ends nobly, preserues Ladies fames.

Why this is but the second time of your coming Kinsman, visit me oftener,
Daughter, I charge you bring this Gentleman along with you: Gentleman, I I cry
ye mercy sir, I call you Gentleman still: I forget you are but a Knight, you
must pardon me sir


For your worships kindenes -- worship I cry you mercy sir, I call you
worshipful still, I forget, you are but a Justice


I am no more in faith.

You must pardon me sir.

It Is quickly done sir, you see I make bold with you Kinsman, thrust my
Daughter and you into one Chamber


Best of all sir: Kindred you know may lie any where.

True, true sir, Daughter receive your blessing -- take heed the Coach iopper
not to much* have a care to the fruits of your body -- look to her Kinsman


Fear it not sir.

Nay Father though I say it, that should not say it, he looks to me more like
a husband then a Kinsman


I hear good commendations of you sir.

You hear the worst of me I hope sir, -- I salute my leave sir.

You Are welcome all over your body sir: nay, I can behave my self courtly,
though I keep house 'ith Country: what, does my Niece hide herself, not
present, ha? Latronello


Sir.

Call my Niece to me.

Yes sir.

A foolish, coy, bashful thing it is, she is afraid to lie with her own
Uncle: i would do her no harm in faith, I keep my self a widdower a purpose, yet
the foolish Girl will not look into it, she should have all in faith, she
knows I have but a time, cannot hold long, see where she comes, pray whom am
I Niece


I hope you are your self.
Uncle to me, and Brother to my Father.

Oh am I so, it does not appear so, -- for surely you would love your Fathers
Brother for your Fathers sake, your Uncle for your own sake


I do so.

Nay you do nothing Niece.


In that love which becomes you best I love (you.

How should I know that love becomes me best?

Because it is chaste, and honorable.

Honorable! it cannot become me then Niece.
For'ime scarce worshipful: Is this an age,
To entertain bare love without the fruits
When I received thee first, I looked
Thou should have been a wife unto my house
And saved me from the charge of marriage.
Do you think your Fathers five thousand pound would ha made me take you else?
no, you should near a ha been a charge to me

As far as I can perceive yet by you,
I Have as much need to marry as ere I had: would not this be a great grief
to your friends think you, if they were alive again


Twould be a grief indeed.

You Have confessed
All about house, that young Fidelio
Who in his Travails does attend the Prince,
Is your vowde love.

Most true, he is my vowed Husband.

And what is a Husband is not a Husband a stranger at first, and will you lie
with a stranger before you lie with your own Uncle? take heed what ye do
Niece, I counsel you for the best: strangers are drunken fellows I can tell
you, they will come home late a nights, beat their wives, and get nothing but
Girls: look to it, if you marry, your stubbernes is your Dowry: five thousand
Crowns were bequeathed to you, true, if you marry with my consent: but if ere
you go to marrying by my consent, i will go to hanging by yours: go too* be
wise and love your Uncle


I should have cause then to repent indeed.
Do you so far forget the Offices
Of blushing modesty? Uncles are half Fathers,
Why they come so near our bloods they are ene part of it.

Why now you come to me Niece: if your Uncle be part of your own flesh and
blood, is it not then fit your own flesh and blood should come nearest to you?
answer me to that Niece


You do allude all to incestuous will,
Nothing to modest purpose: turn me forth,
Be like an Uncle of these latter days,
Periurde enough, enough unnatural,
Play your Executorship, in Tyranny,
Restrain my fortunes, keep me poor, I care not,
In this alone most women i will excel,
I Will rather yield to beggary then to hell.

Very good, a my troth my Niece is Valiant, sha's made me ritcher by five
thousand Crowns, the price of her Dowry: are you so honest, I do not fear
but I shall have the Conscience to keep you poor enough Niece, or else I am
quite altered a late -- The News, may it please you sir


Sir, there is an old fellow, a kind of Law-driuer, entreates conference with
your worship


A Law-driuer, prithee drive him hither.


No, no I say if it be for defect of Appearance, take me out a special
Significauit


Very good sir.

Then if he purchase an Alias or Capias, which are Writs of custom, only to
delay time, your Procedendo does you Knights service -- that is nothing at all,
get your Distringas out as soon as you can for a Jury


I Will attend your god worships coming out.

Do I prithee, attend me, i will take it kindly, a Voluntate.

What, old Seigneur Tangle!

I am in debt to your worships remembrance.

My old master of Fence: come, come, come, I have not exerciz'd this twelve
Moons, I have almost forgot all my Law-weapons


They are under fine and Recovery, your worship shall easily recover them.


I hope so: when there?

Sir.

The Rapler and Dagger foyles instantly: and what is thy suite to me old
Tangle, i will grant it presently


Nothing but this sir, to set your worships hand to the commendation of a Knave
whom no body speaks well on


The more shame for them, what was his offense I pray?

Vestras Deducite Culpas -- nothing but robbing a Vestrie.

What, what! alas poor Knave, give me the Paper, he did but save the
Churchwardens a labor: come, come, he has done a better deed in it then the
parish is a aware off, to prevent the Knaves, he robs but seldom, they once a
quarter: me thinks twere a part of good justice, to hang them at years end, wen
they come out of their office, to the true terrifying of all Collectors and
Sidemen


Your worship would make a fruitful Commonwealths man, the Constable lets
them alone, looks on, and says nothing


A less good man, he lets them alone for quietness sake, and takes half a share
with them: they know well enough too, he has an impediment in his tongue, he is
always drunk when he should speak


Indeed your worship speaks true in that sir: they blind him with beer, and
make him so narrow eyde, that he wincks naturallye at all their Knaueries


So, so, heeres my hand to his commendations.

A Charitate, you do a charitable deed in it sir.

Nay, if it be but a Vestrie matter, visit me at any time, old Signeor
Law-thistle! O well done, here are the Foiles, come, come sir, i will try a
Law-bout with you


I am affraide I shall overthrow you sir in faith.


It Is but for want of use then sir.


Indeed that same odd word Use, makes a man a good Lawyer, and a woman an
arrant -- tuh tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, now am I for you sir: but first to bring you
into form, can your worship name all your weapons


That I can I hope, let me see, Longswoord, what is Longsword? I am so duld with
doing justice, that I have forgot all in faith


Your long sword, that's a writ of delay.

Mass that swords long enough indeed, I ha known it reach the length of
fifteen Terms


Fifteen Terms, that is but a short sword.

Me thinks it is long enough, proceed sir.

A Writ of Delay, Long-sword.
Scandala Magnatum, Backesword.

Scandals are back-swords indeed

Capias cominus, Case of Rapyers.

Oh Desperate!

A Latitat, sword and Dagger.

A writ of Execution, Rapier and Dagger.

Thou art come to our present weapon, but what call you sword and Buckler then?


Oh! that is out of use now, sword and Buckler was called a good conscience, but
that weapons left long ago, that was too manly a fight, too sound a weapon for
these our days, sl'id we are scarce able to lift up a Buckler now, our arms
are so bound to the Pox: one good bang upon a Buckler would make most of our
Gentlemen fly a pieces, it is not for these lintie times, our Lawyers are good
Rapyer and Dagger men, they will quickly dispatch your -- money


Indeed since sword and buckler time, I have observed, there has been
nothing so much fighting: where be all our gallant Swaggerers? there are no
good frayes alate


Oh sir, the properties altered, you shall see less fighting every day then
other, for every one gets him a Mistress, and she gives him wounds enowe, and
you know, the Surgeons cannot beehere and there too, if there were red wounds
too, what would become of the Reinish wounds


Thou say true in faith, they would be but il favouredly looked to then.


Very well sir.

I expect you sir.

I lie in this court for you sir, my Rapyer is my Attorney, and my Dagger his
Clarke


Your Attorney wants a little oyling, me thinks, he looks very Rustily.


It Is but his proper color sir, his Father was an Iremonger, he will nere look
brighter, the rust has so eat into him, has never any leisure to be made
clean


Not in the vacation.

Non Vacat exiguis rebus adesse Ioui.

Then Jove will not be at leisure to scour him, because he ^ere came to him
before


You Are excellent at it sir -- and now you least think on it, I arrest you sir.


Very good sir.

Nay very bad sir by my faith -- I follow you still, as the Officers will
follow you as long as you have a penny


You speak sentences sir -- by this time have I tried my friends, and now I
thrust in bail --


This bail will not be taken sir, they must be two Citizens that are no
Cuckolds


Berlady then 'ime like to lie by it, I had rather twere a hundred that were.


Take heed I bring you not to an Nisiprius sir.

I must ward my self as well as I may sir.

It Is Court day now, Declarat Atturnatus, my Attorney gapes for money.


You shall have no Advantage yet, I put in my Answer.

I follow the suit still sir.

I like not this Court birlady -- I: take me out a writ of Remove, a writ of
Remove, do you see sir


Very well sir.

And place my cause higher.

There you started me sir -- yet for all your Demurres, Plures, and
Sursurarers, which are all Longswords: that is Delays: all the comfort is, in
nine years a man may overthrow you


You must thank your good friends then sir.

Let nine years pass, five hundred crowns cast away a both sides, and the
suite not twenty, my Counselors wife must have another hood you know, and my
Atturneyes wife will have a new forepart, yet see at length law, I shall have
law: now beware, I bring you to a narrow exigent, and by no means can you
avoid the Proclamation --


Oh!

Now follows a writ of execution, a Capias, vt Legatum, gives you a wound
mortal, trippes up your heels, and lays you ith Counter


O Villain!

I cry your worship heartily mercy sir, I thought we had been in Law
together, Aduersarius contra aduersarium by my troth


Oh! reach me thy hand, I nere had such an overthrow in my life.


Twa's long of your Attorney there, he might a staide the execution of Capias
vt Legatum, and removed you with a Supersedeas non molestandum into the Court
of Equity


Pox on him, he fell out of my hand when I had most need of him,

I was bound to follow the suite sir.

Thou could do no less then overthrow me,
I must needs say so.

You had recovered cost else sir.

And now by the mass I think I shall hardly recover without cost.


Nay, that is Certoscio, an execution is very chargeable.


Well, it shall teach me wit as long as I am a Justice: I perceive by this
trial, if a man have a sound fall in Law, he shall feel it in his bones all
his life after


Nay, that is Recto upon Record, for I my self was overthrown in eighty eight
by a Tailor, and I have had a Stitch in my side ever since, oh


Why Latronello, Furtiuo, Fucato, where be these lazy knaves that should
trusse me, not one stirring yet


Follow, follow, follow.


What news there?

This way, this way, follow, follow.

Hark you sluggish Soporiferous villains, there is knaves abroad when you are a
bed, are ye not a shamed on it, a Justices men should be up first, and give
example all knaves


Oh I beseech your good worship.

Your worshipful worship.

Thieves, my two hand sword, i am robbed 'ith Hal, Latronello, Knaves, come down,
my two hand sword


I am Latronello, I beseech your worship, (say.

Thou Latronello, thou lie, my men scorn to have beardes.

We forget our beards, now I beseech your worship quickly remember us.


How now?

Nay there is no time to talk of how now, it is don.

Follow, follow, follow.

Four mark and a Liuerie is not able to keep life and soul together, we
must fly out once a quarte, it is for your worships credit to have money in our
pursse, our Fellow Furtiuo is taken in the Action


A pox on him for a lazy knave, would he be taken?

They bring him along to your worship, your the next Justice, now or never show
your self a good master, an upright Magistrate, and deliver him out of their
hands


Nay, he shall find me -- apt enough to do him good I warrant him.


He comes in a false beard sir.

S'foot what, should he do here else? there is no coming to me in a true on:
if he had one, -- the slave to be taken: do not I keep Geldings swift enough


The goodlyest Geldings of any Gentleman in the shire.


Which did the whoreson knave ride upon?


Upon one of your best sir.

Stand and deliver.

Upon Stand and Deliver: the very Gelding I choose for mine own riding, as
nimble as Pegasus the flying horse yonder: go shift your selves into your
coats, bring hither a great chair, and a little table


With all present speed sir.

And Latronello.

I sir.

Sit you down, and very soberly take the examnation.

I Will draw a few horse heads in a paper, make a show: I hope I shall keep my
countenence


Pox on him again, would he be taken? he frets me: I have been a youth my
self, I ha seen the day I could have told money out of other men's purses
(Mass so I can do now) nor will I keep that fellow about me that dares not
bid a man stand: for as long as drunkenness is a vice, stand is a virtue: but
I would not have 'em taken. I remember now betimes in a morning I would have
peept through the green boughs, and have had the party presently, and then to
ride away sinelye in fear, it was even Venerie to me in faith, the pleasantst
course of life, one would think every Woodcok a Constable, and every Owl an
officer, but those days are past with me: and a my troth I think I am a
greater thief now, and in no danger: I can take my ease, sit in my Chair,
look in your faces now, and rob you, make you bring your money by authority
put off your hat, and thank me for robbing of you, O there is nothing to a
thief under Covert Barn


Come Officers bring him away.

Nay, I see thee through thy false beard, thou mid-winde chinde Rascal,

How now my Masters, what is he? ha?

Your worship knows, I never come but I bring a thief with me.


Thou have left thy wont else Constable.

Sir, we understand you to be the only up rightnes of this place.


But I scare understand you sir.

Why then you understand not your self sir.

Such another word, and you shall change places with the Thief.


A maintayner of equal causes I mean.

Now I have you, proceed sir.

This Gentleman and my self, being led heather by occasion of business, have
been offered the discurtesie of the Country, set upon by three thieves and
robbed


What are become of the other two, Latronello, and Fuca?

Here sir.

They both made away from us, the cry pursues them, but as yet none but this
taken


Latronello.

Sir.

Take his examination.

Yes sir.

Let the Knave stand single.

Thank your good worship.

Has been a suter at Court sure, he thanks me for nothing.

He Is a Thief now sure.

That we must know of him, what are you sir?

A piece next to the Tail sir -- a Seruingman.

By my troth a pretty phrase and very cleanly handled, put it down
Latronello: thou may make use on it. Is he of honor or worship whom thou
seruest


Of both dear sir, honorable in mind, and worshipful in body.


Why would one wish a man to speak better?

Oh sir, they most commonly speak best, that do worst.

Say you so sir, then we will try him farther, -- Does your right worshipful
master, go before you, as an ensample of Vice, and so encourage you to this
slinking iniquity? he is not a Lawer, is he


Has the more wrong sir, both for his conscience, and honesty, he deserves to
be one


Pity he is thief in faith, I should entertain him else.

I, if he were not as he is, he would be better then himself.


No it is well known sir, I have a master, the very picture of wisdom,


For indeed he speaks not one wise word.

And no man but will admire to hear of his Virtues.

Because he nere had any in all his life.

You write all down Latronello.

I warrant you sir.

So sober, so discrete, so judicious:

Hum.

And above all, of most reverend gravity.

I like him for one quality, he speaks well of his master, he will fare the
better: -- Now sir, let me touch you


I sir.

Why, serving a Gentleman of such worship and wisdom, such sobriety and
virtue, such discretion and judgment as your master is, do you take such a
beastly course, to stop horses, hinder Gentlewomen from their meetings, and
make Citizens never ride but a Sundaies, only to avoid Morning prayer and you:
is it because your worshipful Ma. feeds you with lean spits, paies you with
Irish money, or clothes you in northern doze^s


Far be it from his mind, or my report, It Is well known he kept worshipful
cheer the day of his wives burial, pays our four marks a year as duly by
twelve pence a quarter as can be


His wisdom swallows it.

And for Northren dozens, fie, fie, we were nere troubled with so many.

Receiving then such plenteous blessings from your virtuous and bountiful
master, what cause have you to be thief now? answer me to that geere


It Is even as a man gives his mind to it sir.

How sir?

For alas, if the whole world were but of one trade; traffic were nothing:
if we were all truemen, we should be of no trade: what a pitiful world
would here be, heaven forbid we should be all truemen: then how should your
worships next suite be made? not a Tailor left in the land: of what stuff
would you have it made? not a Merchant left to deliver it, would your worship
go in that suit still? You would ha more thieves about you then those you have
banished, and be glad to call the great ones home again, to destroy the little


A notable Rogue.

A my troth, a fine knave, and has answered me gloriously, what wages will thou take after thou art ha^g'd


More then your worship's able to give, I would think foul scorn to be a
Justice then


He says true too yfayth, for we are all full of corruption here, -- hark
you my friends


Sir.

By my troth if you were no crueller then I, I could find in my heart to let him
go


Could you so sir, the more pitiful Justice you.

Nay I did but to try you, if you have no pity, I Will ha none, away he is a
Thief, to prison with him


I am content sir.

Are you content, bring him back, nay then you shall not go.


I Will be as cruel as you can wish: you are content, belike you have a trick to
break prison, or a bribe for the Officers


For us sir?

For you sir? what colour's silver I pray, you nere saw money in your life: --
I Will not trust you with him, Latronello and Fucato, lay hold upon him, to your
charge I commit him


Oh, I beseech you sir.

Nay if I must be cruel, I will be cruel.

Good sir, let me rather go to prison.

You desire that* -- I Will trust no prison with you, I Will make you lie in mine own
house, or I Will know why I shall not


Merciful sir.

Since you have no pity I will be cruel.

Very good sir, you please us well.

You shall appear to morrow sirs.

Upon my kees sir.

You shall be hanged out a'th way, away with him Latronello, and Fucato, --
Officers I discharge you my house, I like not your company

Report me as you see me, fire and fuel,
If men be Jews, Justices must be cruel.

So sir, Extremes set of all Actions thus,
Either too tame, or else too tyranous:
He being bent to fury, I doubt now
We shall not gain access unto your love or she to us.

Most wishfully here she comes.

Is that she?

This is she my Lord.

A modest presence.

Virtue bless you Lady,

You wish me well sir.

I Would first in charge this kiss, and next this paper,
You Will know the language, it is Fidelios.

My ever vowed love, how is his health?

As fair as is his favor with the Prince.

I Am sick with joy, does the Prince love him so?

His life cannot requite it,
Not to wrong the remembrance of his love,
I had a token for you, kept it safe,
Till by misfortune of the way this morning,
Thieves set upon this Gentleman and my self,
And with the rest robbed that.

Oh me, I Am deerly sorry for your chance, was it your loss?
They boldly look you in the face that robbed you,
No farther villains then my uncles men.

What Lady?

It Is my grief I speak so true.

Why my Lord?

But give me pawsing Lady: was he one that took the examination?

One and the chief.

Henceforth hang him that is no way a thief,
Then I hope few will suffer, -- nay all the jest was, he committed him to the
charge of his fellows, and the rogue made it lamentable, cried to leaue'em

None live so wise but fools may once deceive em?

An uncle so insaciate?

I, Is It not strange too,
That al should be by Nature vicious, and he bad against
Nature?

Then you have heard the sum of al my wrongs.

Lady, we have, and desire rather now
To heal 'em, then to hear 'em:
For by a letter from Fidelio
Direct to us, we are entreated jointly,
To hasten your remove* from this foul den,
Of theft and purposed incest:

I rejoice in his chaste care of me, I Will soon be furnished.

He writes that his return cannot be long.

I Am chiefly glad, -- but whither is the place?

To the safe seat of his late wronged mother.

I desire it, --
Her conference will fit mine, well you prevail,

At next grove we will expect you:

I Will not fail.

It stands upon the frame of my reputation I protest Lady.

Lady, that word is worth an hundred Angels at all times, for it cost more:
if I live til tomorrow night, my sweet pleasure thou shall have them


Could you not make 'em a hundred and fifty think you?

I Will do my best endeavor to multiply, I assure you.

Could you not make 'em two hundred?

No by my faith. --

Peace, i will rather be confined in the hundred and fifty.

Come even much about this time, when Tauerns give up their Ghosts, and
Gentlemen are in their first cast. --


I Will observe the season.

And do but whirle the Ring a'th door once about, my maid-seruant shall be
taught to understand the language


Enough my sweet Reuenew.

Good rest my effectual pleasure.

Come hither Phoenix.

What makes your honor break so early?

A toy, I have a toy.

A toy my Lord.

Before thou layest thy wrath upon the duke, -- be aduiz'd.

I, I, I warran you my Lord.

Nay, give my words honor, hear me,
I Will strive to bring this Act into such form,
And credit amongst men, they shall suppose.
Nay verily believe the Prince his son,
To be the plotter of his Fathers murder.

Oh that were infinitely admirable!

Were not, it pleases me beyond my bliss:

Then if his son meet death as he returns,
Or by my hired Instruments turn up,
The general voice will cry -- O happy vengeance!

O blessed vengeance!

I, i will turn my brain
Into a thousand uses, Tire my inventions,
Make my blood sick with study, and mine eye
More hollow then my heart, but I will fashion,
Nay I will fashion it, -- Can counterfeit?

The Princes hand, more truly, most direct,
You shall admire it.

Necessary mischief.
Next to a woman, but more close in secrets
You Are all the kindred that my breast vouch safes,
Look into me anon, -- I must frame, and muse, and
fashion --

It Was time to look into thee, in whose heart
Treason grows ripe, and therefore fit to fall,
That slave first sinkes, whose envy threatens all,
Now is his Venom at full height.

Lying, or being in the said County in the Tenor and occupation aforesaid.


No more then, a writ of course upon the matter of --


Silence.

Oh o-o-o-yes Carlo Turbulenzo, appear or loose twenty mark in the suites.


Ha? whether have my thoughts conveyed me? I am now within the Dizzie murmur of
the law


So that then, the cause being found clear, upon the last Scitation.


Carlo turbulenzo, Come into the Court.

Now, now, now, now, now, upon my knees I praise Mercury the God of law, I have
two suits at issue, two suites at issue


Do you hear sir?

I will not hear, i have other business.

I beseech you my learned Counsel.

Beseech not me, beseech not me, I am a mortal man, a Clyent as you are,
beseech not me


I would do all by your worships direction.


Then hang thy self.

Shall I take out a special supplycauit.

Mad me not, torment me not, tear me not, you will give me leave to hear mine
own cause, mine own cause


Nay moreover, and farther --


Well said my Lawyer, well said, well said.

All the opprobious speeches that man could invent all malicious inuectiues,
called Wittoll to his face


That's I, that's I, thank you my learned counsel for your good remembrance: I
hope I shall overthrow him horse and foot


Nay but good sir.

No more sir, he that brings me happy news first i will relieve first.


Sound executions rot thy cause and thee.

I, I, I, pray so still, pray so still, they will thrive the better


I wonder how this fellow keeps out madness?
What stuff his brains are made on?

I suffer, I suffer, -- till I here a judgment.

What old Signior?

Prithee I will not know thee now, it is a busy time, a busy time with me.


What not me Signeur?

Oh cry thee mercy, give me thy hand, -- fare thee well, -- has no relief
again me then, -- his demurs will not help him, his Sursararaes will but play
the knaves with him


The Justice: it is he


Have I found thee in faith? I thought where I should smell thee out old Tangle.


What old Signeur Iusticer, -- embrace me another time and you can possible:
how does all thy wives children, -- well? that is well said yfayth


Hear me old Tangle.

Prithee do not ravish me, let me go.

I must use some of thy counsel first.

Sirrah, I ha brought him to an Exigent* hark that is my cause, that's my cause
yo^der, I twind'g him, I twind'g him


My Niece is stolen away.


Ah, get me a ne exeat Regno quickly, nay you must not stay vppo'nt, i would feign
have you gone


A ne exeat Regno, i will about it presently, -- adue.

You seek to catch her Justice, she will catch you.

A judgment, a judgment.

What, what, what?

Overthrown, overthrown, overthrown.

Ha, a, a.

News, news, news.

The devil, the devil, the devil.

Twice Tangle's overthrown, twice Tangles overthrown.

Hold:

Now old cheater of the Law,

Pray give me leave to be mad.

Thou that have found such sweet pleasure in the vexation of others.


May I not be mad in quiet?

Very Marrow, very manna to thee to be in law.

Very sirrop of Toades, and perseru'd Adders.

Thou that have vexed, and beggerd the whole
Parrish, and made the honest Church wardens go to
Law with the poores money.

Hear me, do but hear me, I pronounce a terrible, horrible curse upon you
al -- and wish you to my Attorney: see where a Praemunire comes a Dedimus
potestatem, and that most Dreadful Execution, Excommunicato Capiendo, there is
no bail to be taken, I shall rot in fifteen Iayles: make Dice of my bones, and
let my Counselors Son play away his Fathers money with them; may my bones
revenge my quarrel! -- A Capias Cominus? here, here, here, here: quicklye
dip your Quilles in my blood, off with my skin and write fourteen lines of a
side -- there is an honest conscionable fellow, he takes but ten shillinges of
a Bellowes-mender -- here is another deals all with charity, you shall give
him nothing, only his wife an embrodered Pettycoate, a gold frindge for her
tail, or a border for her head, ah sirrah! you shall catch me no more in the
sprindge of your Knaueries


Follow, follow him still, a little thing now sets him forward.


None can except against him, the man's mad,
And priuiledgd by the Moon, if he say true:
Less madness it is to speak sin, then to do.
This wretch that loved before, his food, his strife,
This punishment falls even with his life.
His pleasure was vexation, all his bliss
The torment of another.
Their heart, his health: their starued hopes his store,
Who so loves Law, dies either mad or poor.

A miracle, a miracle!

How now Fidelio?

My Lord a miracle!

What is it?

I have found
One quiet, suffering, and vnlawyer'd man.
An opposite, a very Contrary
To the old turbulent fellow.

Why he is mad.

Mad, why he is in his right wits, could he be madder then he was, if he be any
way altered from what he was, it is for the better, my Lord


Well, but where is this wonder?

It Is coming my Lord: A man so truly a man, so indifferently a creature, using
the world in his right nature but to tread upon, one that would not bruise, the
cowardly est enemy to man, the worm, that dares not show his malice till we
are dead: nay my Lord, you will admire his temper! see where he comes, I
promisd your acquaintance, si

Yon is the Gentleman I did commend for Temper.

Let me embrace you simply.
That Is perfectly, and more in heart then hand:
Let affectation keep at Court.

I, let it.

It Is told me you love quiet

Above wealth.

I above life: I have been wild and rash
Committed many and unnatural crimes,
Which I have since repented.

Twa's well spent.

I was mad, stark mad, nine years together.

I pray! as how?

Going to law, in faith it made me mad.

With the like frenzy not an hour since
An aged man was struck.

Alas I pity him.

He Is not worth pitying, for twa's still his gladness to be at variance.


Yet a man's worth pity,
My quiet blood has blessed me with this gift,
I have cured some, and if his wits be not
Too deeply cut, I will assay to help them.

Sufferance does teach you pity.

O Master, Master, your abominable next neighbor came into the house, being
half in drink, and took away your best Carpet


Has he it?

Alas sir:


Let him go, trouble him not, lock the door quietly after him, and have a
safer care who comes in next


But sir, might I aduize you, in such a cause as this, a man might bouldlye,
nay* with conscience go to Law


Oh, i will give him the table too first. Better endure a fist then a sharp
sword: I had rather they should pull off my clothes then flea of my skin, and
hang that on mine enemies hedge


Why, for such good causes was the law ordaind:

True, and in it self it is glorious and divine,
Law is the very Master piece of heaven:
But see yonder.
There Is many Clouds between the sun and us,
There Is too much cloth before we see the Law:

I Am content with that answer, be mild still,
It Is honor to forgive those you could kill.

There do I keep.

Reach me your hand, I love you,
And you shall know me better.

It Is my suit.

The night grows deep -- and --

Come away, this way, this way.

Who be those? stand close a little.

Oh, you are come as well as ere you came in your life, my Maister's new gone to
bed, give me your Knightly hand, I must lead you into the blind Parlor, my
mistress will be down to you presentlye


I tell you our safest course will be to arrest him when he comes out a'th
Tavern: for then he will be half drunk, and will not stand upon his weapon


Our safest course indeed, for he will draw.

That he will, though he put it up again, which is more of his courtesy, then
of our deserving


The world is nothing but vexation,
Spite and uncharitable Action.

Did you see the Gentleman?

Not I.

Where should he be, it may be he is past by,
Good sir, lets overtake him.

Here sir, now you are there sir, she will come down to you instantlye, I must
not stay with you, my Mistress would be jealous, you must do nothing to me, my
mistress would find it quickly


S'foot whether am I led? brought in byth hand? I hope it can be no harm to
stay for a woman, tho indeed they were never more dangerous, I have ventured
heatherto and safe, and I must venture to stay now, this should be a fair
Rome, but I see it not, the blind Parlor cal's she it


Where art thou, O my Knight!

Your Knight, I am the Dukes knight.

I say you are my knight, for I Am sure I paid for you

Paid for you hum, -- S'foot a light. --

Now out upon the Marmoset, have thou served me so long, and offer to bring in
a Candle


Fair Room, villainous face, and worse woman, I ha learnt something by a
glimpse ath Candle


How happened it you came so soon, I looked not for you these two hours: yet as
the sweet chance is, you came as well as a thing could come, for my hus:
band's newly brought a bed


And what has Jove sent him?

He nere sent him any thing since I knew him, he is a man of a bad nature to
his wife, none but his Maids can thrive under him


Out upon him.

I, judge whether I have a cause to be a Curtezan or no? to do as I do, an
elderly fellow as he is, if he were married to a young Virgin, he were able
to break her heart, tho he could break nothing else: here, here, there is just
a hundred and fifty, but I stole them so hardlye from him, twold ee'ne have
grieud you to have seen it


So twould in faith.

Therefore prithee my sweet pleasure, do not keep company so much, how do
you think I am able to maintain you? though I be a Iewellers wife, Jewels
are like women, they rise and fall, we must be content to loose sometimes, to
gain often, but you are content always to loose, and never to gain: what need
you ride with a Footeman before you


Oh that's the grace,

The grace? it is sufficient grace that you have a Horse to ride upon, you should
think thus with your self every time you go to bed if my head were laid,
what would become of that horse? he would run a bad race then as well as his
Master


Nay, and you give me money to chide me: --

No, if it were as much more, I would think it foul scorn to chide you, I
advise you to be thrifty, to take the time now, while you have it, you shall
sildome get such an other fool as I am, I warrant you: why there is Mettrezza
Auriola keeps her love with half the cost that I am at, her friend can go a
foot like a good Husband, walk in wosted Stockings, and enquire for the
Six-penny ordinary


Pox on it, and would you have me so base?

No, I would not have you so base neither: but now and then, when you keep your
Chamber, you might let your Footeman out for eighteen pence a day, a great
relief at years end I can tell you


The age must needs be foul when vice reformes it.

Nay, I Have a greater quarrel to you yet.

In Faith, what is it?

You made me believe at first the Prince had you in great estimation, and would
not offer to Travail without you, nay, that he could not travail without your
Direction and intelligence


I Am sorry I said so in faith, but sure I was overflowed when I spoke it, I
could nere ha said it else


Nay more, you swore to me, that you were the first that taught him to ride a
great horse, and tread the Ring with agilitie


By my troth I must needs confess I swore a great lie in that, and I was a
villain to do it, for I could nere ride great horse in my life


Why lo, who would love you now but a Citizens wife? so inconstant, so for
sworn: you say women are false Creatures, but take away men, and thei'd be
honester then you -- Nay last of all, which offends me most of all, you told
me you covld countenance me at Court, and you know we esteem a friend there,
more worth then a Husband here


What I spoke of that. Lady, i will maintain.

You maintain? you seen it court?

Why by this Diamond --

Oh take heed, you cannot have that, it is always in the eye of my husband.


I protest I will not keep it, but only use it for th is virtue, as a token
to fetch you,and approve my power, where you shall not only ye be received,
but made known to the best and chiefest


Oh are you true?

Let me loose my Reuenewe else.

That Is your word indeed, and upon that condition take it this kiss and my
love for ever


Enough.

Give me thy hand, i will lead thee forth.

I Am sick of al professions, my thoughts burn:
He travails best, that knows when to return.

Adue, farewell, to bed you, I to my sweet Cittybird, my precious Reuennew, the
very thought of a hundred and fifty Angels, increases Oil and Spirit, ho


I arrest you sir.

Oh!

You have made us wait a goodly time for you, have you not think you? you are
in your Rowses and Mulwines a pox on you: and have no care of poor Officers
staying for you


I drunk but one health I protest, but I could void it now: at whose suit I
pra'y


At the suit of him that makes suits, your Tailor,

Why, he made me the last, this, this that I wear

Argo, nay, we have been Scholars I can tell you, we could not have been
knaves so soon else, for as in that notable City called London, stand two most
famous Universities, Poultrie and Woodstreet, where some are of twenty years
standing, and have took all their degrees from the Masters side, down to the
Mistress side, the Hole, so in like manner --


Come, come, come, I had quite forgot the hundred and fifty Angels.


S'lid where be they?

I Will bring you to the sight of them presently.

A notable Lad, and worthy to be arrested: we will have but ten for waiting, and
then thou shall choose whether thou will run away from us, or we from thee


A match at running, come, come, follow me.

Nay, fear not that.

Peace, you may happen to see toys, but do not see them.

Pah.

That's the Door.

This? -- knockes.

S foot Officer you have spoilde all already?

Why?

Why? you shall see, you should have but whirld the ring once about, and
there is a Maid servant brought up to understand it


Whose at door?

Als well again: phist, it is I, it is I.

You, what are you?

Puh, where is thy mistress?

What of her?

Tell her One, she knows who, her Pleasure's here, say.

Her Pleasure? my mistress scorns to be without her pleasure at this time of
night: is she so void of friends think you? take that for thinking so: a
Box


The hundred and fifty Angels are locked up in a Box, we shall not see them
tonight


Howe's this? am I used like a hundred pound Gentleman? Does my Reuennew
forsake me? Dam me if ever I be her pleasure again. -- Well I must to prison


Go prepare his room, there is no remedy, i will bring him along, he is tame
enough now


Dare my Tailor presume to use me in this sort?
He steals and I must lie in prison for it.

Come, come away sir.

Art sure thou saw him arested Drawer?

If mine eyes be sober.

And that is a question, Mass here he goes, he shall not go to prison, I have
a trick shall bail him -- away


Oh!

Guess, guess, who am I? who am I?

Who the Devil are you? let go, -- a Pox on you, who are you? I have lost my
prisoner


Prisoner: I Have mistook, I cry you heartily mercy, I have done you infinite
injury, a my troth I took you to be an honest man


Where were your eyes? could you not see I was an Officer, stop, stop, stop,
stop


Hah, hah, hah, ha.

Now Phoenix.

Now my Lord.

Let princely blood
Nourish our hopes, we being confusion now.

A terrible sudden blow.

I:what day is this hangs over us?

Bith Mass Monday.

As I could wish my purpose will thrive best.

Twa's first my birthday, now my fortunes day,
I see whom fate will raise needs never pray.

Never.

How is the air?

Oh full of trouble.

Does not the sky look pittiously black

As if twere hung with Rich men's Consciences.

Ah, Stuck not a Comet like a Carbuckle
Upon the dreadful browe of Twelve last night?

Twelve, no twa's about one.

About one most proper, for that's the Duke.

Well shifted from thy self.

I could have wished it between one and two
His son and him.

I Will give you comfort then.

Prithee.

There was a villainous Raven seen last night,
Over the presence chamber in hard Iustle
With a young Eglet.

A Raven! that was I, what did the Raven?

Mary my Lord the Raven -- to say truth,
I left the combat doubtful.

So it is still,
For all is doubt, till the deed crown the will,
Now bless thy loins with Freedom, wealth and honor,
Think all thy seed young Lords, and by this Act.
Make a foote-cloathd posterity: now imagine
Thou see thy Daughters with their trains borne up,
Whom else despised want, may curse to whoredom,
And public shames, which our state never threate,
She Is never lewd, that is accounted great.

I Will alter that Court-Axiom* thus renewd,
She Is never great, that is accounted lewd.

Stand close, the presence fills, here, here the place
And at his rizing, let his fall be base,

Beneath thy foot.

How for his Guard my Lord?

My gold and fear keeps with the chief of them

That Is rarely well.

Bold heedlesse slave, that dares attempt a deed which shall in pieces rend
him my Lords both


The happiness of the day.

Time my returning,
Treasons have still the worst, yet still are spurning.

The Duke!

I nere was gladder to behold him.

All. Long live your Grace.

I do not like that strain,
You know my age affoords not to live long.

Spoke truer then you think for.

Bestow that wish upon the Prince our Son.

Nay, he is not to live long neither.

Him as the wealthy Treasure of our hopes,
You as posession of our present Comfort,
Both in one heart, we reverence in one.

Oh Treason of a good complexion.

How now, what fresher news fills the Courts ear?

Fidelio!

Glad Tidings to your Grace,
The prince is safe returned, and in your Court.

Our joy breaks at our eyes, the Prince is come!

Soul qucking news -- pale vengeance to my blood.

By me presenting to your serious view,
A brief of all his Travails.

It Is most welcome.
It shall be Dear and precious to our Eye.

He Reads, i am glad her reads.
Now take thyopportunitie, leave that place.

At his first rising let his fall be base.

That must be altered now.

Which? his rising or his fall?

Art thou dull now?
Thou hear'st the Prince is come.

What Is here my Lord?

My Lord?

I have got such a large portion of knowledge, most worthy father, by the
benefit of my Travail


And so he has no doubt my Lord.

That I am bold now to warn you of Lord
Proditors insolent Treason, who has irreligiouslye seduced a fellow, and
closely conuaide him even in the presence-chaire to murder you


Oh guilty, guilty.

What was that fell? what is he?

I am the man.

O slave!

I have no power to strike,

I Am gone, i am gone.

Let me admire heauen's wisdom in my Son.

I confess it, he hired me --

This is slave,
It Is forged against mine honor and my life,
For in what part of reason cannot appear,
The Prince being Trauaild should know Treasons here
Plain counterfeit --

Do thou make false our Son?

I know the prince will not affirm it.

He can and will my Lord.

Most just, he may:

A guard.

We cannot but in loyal zeal our selves,
Lay hands on such a Villain. --

Stay you, I find you here too.

Us my Lord?

Against Lussurioso and Infesto, who not only most ryotouslye consume their
houses in vicious gaming, morgaging their livings to the Merchant, whereby he
with his heirs enter upon their lands, from whence this abuse comes, that in
short time the Son of the Merchant has more Lordships then the Son of the
Nobleman(which else was never borne to inheritance) but that which is more
impious, they most adulterously train out young Ladies to Midnight banquets,
to the utter defamation of their own honors, and ridiculous abuse of their
Husbands


How could the Prince hear that?

Most true my Lord.
My Conscience is a witness against it self,
For to that execution of chaste honor,
I was both hyr'd and led.

I hope the Prince out of his plentious wisdom
Will not give wrong to us: as for this fellow
He Is poor, and cares not to be desperate.

Justice my Lord, I have my Niece stolen from me
She Has left her Dowry with me, but she is gone,
I Would rather have had her love then her money I,
This, this, is one of them, Justice my Lord:
I know him by his face, this is the Thief.

Your grace may now in milder sense perceive
The wrong done to us by this impudent wretch,
Who has his hand fixed at the throat of law,
And therefore durst be desperate of his life,

Peace, you are too foul, your crime is in excess:
One spot of him, makes not your Ulcers less.

Oh!

Did your Violence force away his Niece?

No my good Lord; ilestil confess what is truth.
I did remove her from her many wrongs,
Which she was pleased to leave, they were so vilde.

What are you named?

Falso my Lord, Justice Falso, i am known by that name.

Falso, you came fitly,
You are the very next that follows here.

I hope so my Lord, my name is in all the Records
I can assure your good grace.

Against Justice Falso.

Ah.

Who having had the honest charge of his Niece committed to his trust, by the
last will and Testament of her deceased father, and with her all the power of
his wealth, not only against faith and conscience detaines her Dowry, but
against Nature and humanity assaies to abuse her body


I Am present to affirm it my loved Lord.

How? what make I here?

Either I must agree.
To loathed lust, or despisde beggary.

Are you the plaintiue here?

I my good Lord,
For fault of a better.

Sildome comes a worse -- and moreover not containde in this vice only, which
is odious to much, but against the sacred use of Justice, maintains three
threeues to his men


Cuds me!

Who only take Pursses in their Masters liberty, where if any one chance to
be taken, he appears before him in a false Beard, and own of his own fellows
takes his examination


By my troth as true as can be, but he shall not know on it.

And in the end will execute Justice so cruellye upon him, that he will not
trust him in a prison, but commit him to his fellows chamber


Can a man do nothing in the Country but it is told at Court? there is some busy
informing knave abroad, a my life


That this is true, and these, and more my Lord.
(Be it under pardon spoken for mine own)
He the disease of Justice, these of honor,
And This of Loyalty and Reverence:
The unswept venom of the Palace,

Slave!

Behold the Prince to approve it.

Oh, where?

Your Eyes keep with your Actions, both look wrong.

An infernal to my spirit.

My Lord the Prince:

Tread me to dust, thou in who^ wonder keeps,
Behold the Serpent on his belly creepes.

Ranckle not my foot, away.
Treason, we laugh at thy vain-labouring strings,
Above the foot thou have no power ore Kings

I cannot with sufficient joy receive thee,
And yet my ioye's too much,

My royal Father,
To whose unnatural murder I was hired,
I thought it a more natural course of travail,
And answering future expectation,
To leave far Countries, and enquire mine own,

To thee let Reverence all her powers engage,
That art in youth a miracle to age.
State is but blindness, ethou had piercing Art,
We only saw the knee; but thou the heart.
To thee then power and Dukedom we resign,
*He Is fit to reign, whose knowledge can refine:

Forbid it my obedience.

Our word's not vain,
I know thee wise can both obey and reign,
The rest of life we dedicate to heaven.

A happy and safe reign to our new Duke.

Without your prayers safer, and happier: Fidelio.

My royal Lord.

Here take this Diamond:
You know the virtue on it, it can fetch vice:
Madam Castiza:

She attends my Lord.

Place a guard near us.
Know you you fellow Lady?

My honors evil.

Torment again?

So ugly are thy crimes,
Thine eye cannot endure 'em.
And that thy face may stand perpetually
Turned so from ours, and thy abhorred self,
Neither to threaten wrack of state or credit,
An everlasting banishment ceaze on thee.

Oh Fiend!

Thy life is such it is too bad to end.

May thy Rule, life, and all that is in thee glad,
Have as short time -- as thy begetting had.

Away, thy curse is idle, the rest are under reformation, and therefore under
pardon


Our duties shall turn edge upon our crimes.


S'lid I was afraid of nothing, but that for my theeuerie, and bawderie I
should have been turned to an Inkeeper: my daughter, I am ashamed her worship
should see me


Who would not love a friend at Court? what fine Galleries and rooms am I
brought through? I had thought my knight durst not have shown his face here, I


Now mother of pride, and daughter of lust, which is your friend now?


Ah me!

I Am sure you are not so unprovided to be without a friend here, you will pay
enough for him first


This is the worst room that ever I came in.

I am your servant Mistress, know you not me!

Your worship is to great for me to know: I Am but a small timbred-woman when
I Am out of my apparel, and dare not venture upon greatness


Do you deny me then? know you this purse?

That purse? O death has the Knight served me so? given away my Favors?


Stand forth -- thou one of those, for whose close lusts the plague never
leaves the City
Thou worse then common: private, subtle harlot,
That do deceive Three with one feigned lip,
Thy husband, the worlds eye, and the laws whip.
Thy zeal is hot, for it is to lust and frawde,
And do not dread to make thy book thy Bawd,
You Are curse enough to husbands il-got gains,
For whom the Court reiects, his gold maintains:
How dear and rare was Freedom wont to be,
Now few but are by their wives copies free,
And brought to such a head that now we see,
City and Suburbs wear one liuerie.

It Is long of those, an't like your grace, that come in upon us, and will never
leave marrying of our widows till they make 'em all as free as their first
husbands


I perceive you can shift a point well.

Let me have pardon I beseech your grace, and I Will peach 'em all, all the close
women that are, and upon my knowledge there is above five thousand within the
walls and the liberties


A band* they shall be sent against the Turk, Infidels against Infidels.


I will hereafter live so modestly, I will not lie with mine own husband, nor
come near a man in the way of honesty


I Will be her warrant my Lord.

You are deceived, you think y' are still a Justice.

S'foot, worse then I was before I kneeld, I am no Justice now, I know I shall
be some Inne-keeper at last


My father! it is mine own father.

I should have wondered else, lust being so like.

Her birth was kin to mine, she may prove modest, for my sake I beseech you
pardon her


For thy sake I Will do more, Fidelio hand her,
My favors on you both, next all that wealth
Which was committed to that Periur'ds trust.

I Am a beggar now, worse then an Inne-keeper.

Your Mittimus shall not serve, I Will set my self free with a Deliberandum, with
a Deliberandum, mark you


What Is he? a guard!

Under your sufferance, worthy Father,
His harm is to himself,
One that has loved vexation so much,
He cannot now be rid on it,
Has been so long in suits that he is Law-mad.

A judgment, I crave a judgment, yea! Nunc pro tunc, Corruptione alicuius, I
peept me a Raven in the face, and I thought it had been my Solister: oh the
pens prick me


And here comes he (wonder for temperance:)
Will take the cure upon him.

A blessing to this fair assembly.

Awa, yile have none ont, give me an Audita querela, or a Testificandum, or a
dispatch in twelve Terms, there is a blessing, there is a blessing


You see the unbounded rage of his disease,

It Is the foul fiend my Lord has got within him the rest are fair to this,
this breeds in Ink

And to that color turns the blood possessed,
For instance, now your grace shall see him dressed.

Ah hah I rejoice then he is puzzled* and muzled too Is It come to a Soepe corpus?


Ah, good sir, this is for want of patience.

That Is a fool.
She never saw the Dogs and the Bears fight,
A Country thing.

This is for lack of grace,

I Have other business, not so much idle time.

You never say your prayers.

I Am, aduizde by my learned counsel,

The power of my charm come over thee,
Place by degrees thy wits before thee,
With silk en patience here I bind thee,
Not to move till I unwind thee.

Yea! is my cause so muddy? do I stick, do I stick (fast?
Advocate here is my hand, pull, art made of flint?
Wilt not help out? -- alas there is nothing in it.

Oh do you sluice the Vein now?


Yes my honored Lord.

Pray let me see the issue.

I therefore seek to keep it, -- now burst out
Thou filthy stream of trouble, spite and doubt.

Oh an extent, a Proclamation, a Summons, a Recognisance, a Tachment. and
Iniunction, a Writ, a Seysure, a Writ of praeisement, an Absolution, a Quietus
est


You Are quieter I hope by so much Dreggs.
Behold my Lord:

This, why it out frowns Ink:

It Is the diseases Nature, the Fiends drink.


Oh sick, sick, Signior Ply-fee, sick: lend me thy Nightcap, oh!


The Balsum of a temperate brain,
I pour into this thirsty vein,
And with this blessed oil of quiet,
Which is so cheap, that few men buy it,
Thy stormy Temples I allay,
Thou shall give up the Devil and pray,
Forsake his works, the'yre foul and black,
And keep thee bare in pursse and back.
No more shall thou in paper quarrel,
To dress up Apes in good apparel.
He throws his stock, and all his flock,
Into a swallowing gulf,
That sendes his Goose unto his Fox,
His Lamb unto his Wolf.
Keep thy increase,
And live at peace,
For war's not equal to this battle,
That eats but men this men and cattaile,
Therefore no more this combat choose:
Where he that wins, does always loose,
And those that gain all, with this curse receive it,
From fools they get it, to their sons they leave it.

Hail sacred patience, I begin to feel
I have a Conscience now, Truth in my words, Compassion in my heart, and above
al, in my blood peaces music

Use me how you can,
You shall find me an honest-quiet man.
Oh, pardon, that I dare behold that face,
"Now I Have least law, I hope have most grace,

We both admire the workman and his piece:
Thus when all hearts are tunde to Honors strings,
There is no music to the Quire of Kings.

THe marks and notions extant in each spirit,
Sealed by the industrious hand of art and merit,
Me thinks appear transparant (as the mind
By fence were bounded and might seem confind
In the external eye) nor shall our tragic muse,
(If strong hope fail not) need a coynd excuse
But to those marginall noates of yours do bring
(In following nombers from the learned spring)
Matter instructiue to enrich their parts
Where knowledge reigns crowned with it own deserts,
Let such with serious and impartial hearing
Sound sense, quick sight and judgment never erring:
Suruay and censure the mineruall frame
Of his elaborate work: and if his name
Merit regard, and you vouchsafe to grace him
With eminent love, or mongstthose lawreats place him,
That with the magic of sweet poesy,
Transfer Pernassus into Brittany,
He shall digest the Chaos of his brain,
To tunefull order and acquire a strain,
Near to the music of the heavenly spheres,
To fit Times guard and ravish choysest ears.
FAme and Opinion like the two vvingd cap
On Hermes head, do lift all Poets up:
Some, though deserving, yet above the Sphere
Of true impartial censure, whose tuned ear
Listens to all and can with judgment say,
Others sing well, though Thracian Orpheus play.
Our Muse affects no excellence: if Fame tell
And through her shrill trompe at the Muses well
(Where the thrice trebled bench of learning sits
In strict examination of others wits)
Sound ours, though humbly strains, whose infant growth
Nor dares, nor will, with times hugd darlings quarrel,
Nor stand the lightning with the sacred Laurel)
We rest content: yet thus far may conceit
Carry each laboring Artist, where the weight
Of his oyld task is over, that his tongue
May like a father of his tender young
Speak natures language and not be withstood,
When with our Muse he says, that This is good.
This Epilogue should have been printed at the end of the book, but there was
no spare place for it
