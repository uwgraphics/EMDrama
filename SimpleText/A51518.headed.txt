SEttle thy Study, Faustus, and begin
To sound the Depth of that thou will profess;
These Metaphysics of Magicians,
And Negromantick Books, are heavenly
Lines, Circles, Letters, Characters,
Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires;
A sound Magician is a Demi-God:
Here tire my Brains to get a Deity.

O Faustus I lay that damned Book aside;
And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy heart to blasphemy.

Go forward, Faustus, in that famous Art
Wherein all Natures Treasure is contained:
Be thou on Earth as Jove is in the Sky,
Lord and Commander of these Elements.

How am I glutted with conceit of this?
Shall I make Spirits fetch me what I please?
I Will have 'em fly to India for Gold,
Ransack the Ocean for Orient Pearl.
I Will have 'em Wall all Germany with Brass;
I Will levy Soldiers with the Coin they bring,
And chase the Prince of Parma from our Land.
It Is now the Dead high Noon of Night,
And Lucifer his Spirits freedom gives;
I Will try if in this Cricle I can Rai^e
A Demon to inform me what I long for.

Faustus, I a^tend thy Will.


Where are thou?


Here.





What Noise is that? Have thou any Companions with thee?


No.


It comes this way?


Oh, oh, O --


What ail'st thou?


OF of of


Speak, Fellow, what is the Matter?


O Poor Scaramouche l'


Speak, I conjure thee; or Achero^tis Dii Demogorgon. --


O I beseech you Conjure no more, for I am frighted into a Diabetes already.


Frighted at what?


I have seen, Oh, oh --


What?


Tho Devil.


Art sure it was the Devil?


The Devil, or the Devil's Companion: He had a Head like a Bulls, with Horns
on; and two Eyes that glowed like the Balls of a dark Lantern: His Hair stood a
Tiptoe, like your new-fashion'd Top-kno^s; with a Mouth as large as a King's
Beef Eater: His Nails was as sharp as a Welshman's in Passion; and he looked as
frightful as a Sergeant to an Al^^tian


But why art thou a^raid of the Devil?


Why I never said my Prayers in all my Life, but once; and that was when my
damned Wife was sick, that she might dye: My Ears are as deaf to good Council,
as French Dragoons are to Mercy. And my Conscience wants as much sweeping as a
Cook's Chimny. And I have as many Sins to answer for as a Churchwarden, or an
Overseer of the Poor


Why, the Devil loves Sinners at his Heart.


Does he so?


He hates none, but the Virtuous, and the Godly. Such as Fast, and go to
Church, and give Alms-deeds


I never saw a Church in my Life, thank God, (I mean the Devil;) and for
Fasting, it was always my Abomination; and for Alms, I never gave any Thing in
my Life, but the Itch once to a Pawn-broker. Therefore I hope he may Love me


And he shall Love thee; I Will bring the^ acquainted with him.


Acquainted with the Devil?


Ay; Tant^ m^tropon^is Acherontis.


Oh, oh, oh.


Fear nothing Mephostopholis, be visible.

I charge thee to be gone, and change thy Shape; thou art too ugly to attend on
me. I find there is Virtue in my Charm; Come, rise up, Fool, the Devil's gone


The Devil go with him.


Fear nothing, I command the Devil. If thou will leave thy Chimny-sweeping
Trade, and live with me, thou shall have Meat and Drink in Plenty; and 40
Crowns a Year shall be thy Wages; I Will make* thee Learned in the black Art


I am a Student in that already* But let me consider, Good Meat and Drink, and
40 Crowns a Year. Then I Will change my black Art for yours


There Is Earnest, thou art now my Servant; dispose of thy Brooms and Poles,
they will be useless to thee here; take this Key, go into my Study* and clean*
take all the Books you find scattered about, and range 'em orderly upon the
Shelves


Happy Scaramouche, now may thou Swear, Lie, Steal, Drink and Whore; for thy
Master is the Devil's Master, and thou in time may master 'em both


Now, Faustus, what would thou have with me?

I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,
And do whatever Faustus shall command.

Ay Faustus, so I will, if thou will purchase me of Lucifer.

What says Lucifer, thy Lord?

That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he Lives,
So thou will buy my Service with thy Blood.

Already Faustus has hazarded that for thee.

Ay, but thou must bequeath it solemnly,
And write a Deed of Gift with it;
For that Security craves Lucifer.
If thou deny it, I must back to Hell.

But Faustus, if I shall have thy Soul,
I Will be thy Slave, and worship thy Commands,
And give thee more than thou have Will of.

If he will spare me Four and twenty Years,
Letting me Live in all Voluptuousness,
To have thee ever to attend on me,
To give me whatsoever I shall ask,
And tell me whatsoever I demand;
On these Conditions I resign it to him.

Then, Faustus, stab thy Arm courageously,
And bind thy Soul, that at some certain Day
Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;
And then be thou as Great as Lucifer.

Lo, Mephostopholis, for Love of thee, Faustus has cut
His Arm, and with his proper Blood
Assures his Soul to be great Lucifers.

But, Faustus, write it in manner of a Deed, and Gift.

Ay, so I do; but, Mephostopholis, my Blood congeals, and I can write no more.


I Will fetch thee Fire to dissolve it straight.

What might the staying of my Blood portend,
It is unwilling I should write this Bill.

Yet, Faustus, think upon thy precious Soul.

No, Faustus, think of Honor, and of Wealth.

Of Wealth. Why all the Indies, Ganges, shall be mine.


No, Faustus, everlasting Tortures shall be thine.

No, Faustus, everlasting Glory shall be thine.
The World shall raise a Statue of thy Name,
And on it write, This, this is he that could command^ the World.


Command the World; Ay, Faustus, think on that.
Why streams not then my Blood that I may write?
Faustus gives to thee his Soul; Oh! there it stops. Why should thou not? Is
not thy Soul thy own


See, Faustus, here is Fire, set it on.

So now the Blood begins to clear again.

What is it I would not do to obtain his Soul?

Consummatum ect; the Bill is ended.
But what is this Inscription on my Arm?
Homo fuge: Whether shall I fly?
My Senses are deceived, here is nothing writ;
O yes, I see it plain, even here is writ.
Homo fuge: yet shall not Faustus sly
I Will call up something to delight his Mind.

What means this then?

It Is to delight thy Mind, and let thee see
What Magic can perform.

And may I raise such Spirits when I please.

Ay, Faustus, and do greater Things than these.

Then, Mephostopholis, receive this Deed of Gi^t;
But yet Conditionally, that thou perform all
Covenants and Articles herein subscribed.

I swear by Hell, and Lucifer, to effect all Promises between us both.

Then take it.

Do you deliver it as your Deed, and Gi^t?

Ay, and the Devil do you good on it.

So, now, Faustus, ask what thou will.

Then let me have a Wife.

What sight is this?

Now, Faustus, will thou have a Wife?

Here Is a hot Whore indeed, I Will have no Wife.

Marriage is but a Ceremonial Toy;
I Will cull thee out the fairest Curtezans,
And bring 'em every Morning to thy Bed:
She whom thy Eye shall like, thy Heart shall have.

Then, Mephostopholis, let me behold the Famous
Hellen, who was the Occasion of great Troys Destruction.

Faustus, thou shall.

O Mephostopholis! what would I give to gain a Kiss from off those lovely Lips.


Faustus, thou may.


My Soul is fled; come Hellen, come, give me my Soul again; she is gone.


Women are shy you know at the first Sight; but come, Faustus, command me
somewhat else


Then tell me, is Hell so terrible as Churchmen write it.


No, Faustus, it is Glorious as the upper World; but that we have Night and Day,
as you have here: Above there is no Night


Why sighs my Mephostopholis, I think Hell's a mere Fable.


Ay, think so still.


Tell me who made the World?


I will not.


Sweet Mephos^.


Move me no further.


Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any Thing.


That Is not against our Kingdom, this is: Thou are Lost; think thou of Hell.


Think, Faustus, upon him that made the World.


Remember this.


Ay, go accursed Spirit to ugly Hell,
It Is thou have damned distressed Faustus Soul:
I will Repent: Ha!
This Bible's fast, but here is another:
Is It not too late?

Too late.


Never too late, if Faustus will repent.


Faustus, behold, behold thy Deed; if thou r^pent Devils will tear thee in
Pieces


Repent, and they shall never raze thy Skin.


This must be Mr. Doctor's House; I Will make ^old to knock: My Heart fails me
already

I begin to tremble at the Thoughts of seeing the Devil.

Here Is a great Resort of Devils, the very Doors smell of Brimstone: I Will even
back -- No: I Will be a Man of Resolution: But if Mr. Doctor should send a
Familiar to open the Door, in what Language should I speak to the Devil


This is some malicious Spirit, that will not let me alone at my Study; but
I Will go in, and conn my Book


I believe Mr. Doctor is very Busy; but I Will rap this time with Authority.


I have left the Door open to save the Devil the labor of Knocking, if he has
a mind to come in: For I am resolved not to stir from my Book; I found it in
the Doctor's Clo^et, and know it must contain something of the Black Art


Oh here is Mr. Doctor himself; he is reading some co^juring Book. I Would fain jecit.


This must be a conjuring Book by the hard Words. AB, EB, IB, OB, VB* BA, BO,
BV, BY


It Is Child's Primer.


The Devil, the Devil; be gone, avoid Satan.


O the Devil! Now will I lie as if I were Dead, and let the Devil go hunt for
my Soul


I have learned to raise the Devil, but how the Devil shall I do to lay him.
Ha! what is here, a dead Body? The Devil assumed this Body, and when I began to
mu^ter my Prayers, he was in such haste he left his Carcass behind him. Ha! it
stirs; no, 'twas but my Fancy

All Is dead but's Head.
The Devil, the Devil! Be gone; what art thou?

A poor unfortunate Devil.


The Devil; Avaunt then Hogon mogon strogon.


O good Mr. Doctor, conjure up no more Devils and I Will be gone, or any thing. --
I came only to ask your Black Artship a Question


No, this is not the Devil. Who are thou? Whence come thou? What Is thy
Business, Quick, or Hogon strogon


Hold, hold, hold, I am poor Harlequin: By the Learned I am called Z^ne, by the
Vulgar Jack Pudding, I was late Fool to a Mountebank* and last Night, in the
mistaking the Pipkin, I eat up a Pot of Bolus instead of Hasty P^dding; and
devoured Three Yards of Diaculum Plaster instead of Pancake, for which my
Master has turned me out of Doors instead of Wages: Therefore, to be revenged,
I come to hire a Devil or two of you, Mr. Doctor, of a strong Constitution,
that may swallow up his Turpentine Pills as fast as he make 'em, that he may
never cure poor Whore more of a Clap; and then he will be undone, for they are
his chief Patients


What Practice has he?


Why his Business is to patch up rotten Whores against the Term for Country
Lawyers, and Attorneys Clerks; and against Christmas, E^ster and Wh^^sum
Holidays, for City Apprentices; and if his Pills be destroyed, 'twill ruin him
in one Term


Come in; and for a Crown a We^k I Will let thee out a Devil, as they do Horses
at Livery, shall swallow him a Peck of Pills a day, though every one were as
big as a Pumpkin; and make nothing of a Bolus for a Breakfast


O brave Mr. Doctor! O dainty Mr. Devil!


S^igniora.


FAustus, Repent; yet Heaven will pity thee.


Thou art a Spirit, Heaven cannot pity thee.


Who buzzes in my Ear, I am a Spirit; ^e I a Devil yet Heaven can pity me: Yea,
Heaven will pity me, if I repent


Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.


Ay, Sweet Faustus think of Heaven, and heavenly Things.


My Heart is hardened, I cannot repent.
Scarce can I name Salvation, Faith, or Heaven,
But I am pinched, and pricked, in thousand Places.
O help distressed Faustus!
Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Mephostopholis rises.

Non^ can afford thee help; for only I have Interest in thee, Faustus.


Oh! What art thou, that looks so terrible?


I am Lucifer, and this is my Companion Prince in Hell.


We are come to tell thee thou do injure us.


Thou call'st on Heaven contrary to thy Promi^e.


Thou should not think on Heaven.


Nor will I henceforth pardon him for this,
And Faustus Vows never to look to Heaven.

So shall thou show thy self a faithful Servant,
And we will highly gratify thee for it.

Those Words delight my Soul.


Faustus, we are come in Person to show thee Passtime; sit down, and thou shall
behold the Seven Deadly Sins in their own proper Shapes and Likeness


That Sight will be as pleasant to my Eye, as Paradise to Adam the first Day of
his Creation


Talk not of Paradise, but mind the Show. Go, Mephostopholis, and fetch 'em in;
and, Faustus, question 'em their Names


What art thou?


I am Pride; I was begot by Disdain and Affectation, I always took the Wall of
my Betters; had ever the first Cut, or else would not eat: I scorned all
Advice, never thought any one handsome but my self; had the best Pue in the
Church, though a Tradesman's Wife; and at last dyed of the Spleen, for want of
a Coach and Six Horses. Why is not thy Room perfumed, and spread with Cloth of
Tissue? What must you sit, and I stand? Rise up Brute


Go, thou art a proud Slut indeed.
N^w what art thou the Second.

I am Covetousness; I was begot by a close Fist, and a griping Heart, in a
Us^rer's Chest. I never eat, to save Charges: This Coat has covered me for
Fourscore Winters: This Beard had seen as many more. I never slept in my Life,
but always watched my Gold


What wort thou on Earth?


I was first an Exciseman, and cheated the King and Country; then I was a
Baker, and from every Neighbor's ^oaf I stole Two Pound, and swore 'twas shrunk
in the Oven. I was a Vintner, and by bribing of Quest men had leave to ^ell in
Pint Bottles for Quarts: At last I was a Horsecourser, made Smith^ield too hot
to hold me, and rid Post to the Devil? Give me some Gold, Father


What art thou the Third?


I am Envy; begot by a Chimny-sweeper upon an Oyster-wench. I cannot read, and
wish all Books burnt. I always cursed the Government that I was not preferred;
and ^as a Malcontent in Three Kings Reigns. I am Lean with seeing others Eat;
and I wish the Devil would make a Sponge of thy Heart, to wipe out the Score of
my Sins


Out Envious Wretch. What art thou the Fourth?


I am Wrath; I had neither Father nor Mother, but leaped out of a Lion's Mouth
when I was scarce an Hour old. I always abhorred the Art of Patience, and cursed
all Fishermen. I beat my Wife for my Pleasure; cursed Heaven in my Passion,
'cause it gave me no Fortune, and was hanged for a Rape on a Scotch Pedlar


What art thou the Fifth?


I am Gluttony; begot by a Plowman on a Washerwoman, who devoured a Chedder
Cheese in two Hours. I am of a Royal Pedigree: My Grandfather was a Sur-loin
of Beef, and my Mother a Gammon of Bacon: My Sisters were Sows, which supplied
me with Pork: My Brothers were Calves, which afforded me Veal: My Godfathers
were Peter Pickled-Herring, and Michael Milk-Porredg: My Godmothers were Susan
Salt-butter, and Margery Sous'd-Hog'sFace. Now, Faustus, thou have heard my
Pedigree, will thou invite me to Supper


Not I.


Then the Devil choke thee.


What art thou the Sixth?


Hey ho! I am Sloth; I was begotten at Church by a sleepy Judge on a
Costermonger's Wife, in the middle of a long Sermon. I am as Lazy as a
Fishmonger in the Dogdays, or a Parson in Lent: I would not speak another Word
for a King's Ransom


And what are you, Mr. Minks, the Seventh and last?


I am one that love an Inch of Raw Mutton better than an Ell of Fried
Stock Fish, and the first Letter of my Name begins with Leachery


This Sight delights my Soul.

Faustus, in Hell are all manner of Delights.

O might I see Hell once, and return safe.

Faustus, thou shall; give me thy hand.
Hence let us descend, and we will Faustus show
The mighty Pleasures in the World below.

So, now am I in my Pontificalibus: Now can I show my Black Art; for I have
found that heavenly Book which Faustus used to raise the Dead in: Come, stand
within this Circle


It Is time to Conjure, for I am almost famished. We have fasted like Priests
for a Miracle


I Will make thee amends presently; I Will conjure up a Spirit, ask what thou will
thou shall have it


Let me alone for asking.


Be very earnest with him, and entreat mightily.


I Will entreat Earnestly.


Silence. Sint mihi Dii Acherontis propitii Nobis Diccatus, Mephostopholis, etc.


How am I tortured by these Villains Charms?
From Constantinople have they brought me now,
Only for Measure of these idle Slaves? What
Would you with Mephostopholis?

We Would know how Dr. Faustus does.

Well.

When comes he home?

Within Two Days.

What was he doing when you left him?

He was at Supper, eating good Cheer.

Good Mr. Devil, tell him we are almost starved* and desire him to send us some
of his good Cheer


Is that all?


Some Wine too?


What else.


What else: Why if Fornication been't against your Commandments, we would have
some live Flesh; a handsome Wench


Only for a third Person, and please your Damnat^on.


You shall have your Desires.


We desire your Mephostopholiship too, not to let us stay the Roasting and
Boiling of any thing: For we are as Eager as the Wine in Smith^ield, and want
no whetting


You shall.
Now if your mighty Darkness would please to Retire.

Farewell.


Now how do you like my Art?


O rare Art! O divine Mr. Doctor Scaramouche! If the Devil be as good as his
Word, I Will owe him a good Turn as long as I live: But I wish our third Person
would come

^^a! What Is here?


I am sent by Pluto to bear you Company.


Is this his third Person? Or is it Three Generations in One? Come you from
Guild Hall, Sir


No, Mortal, from the Stygian Lake. I am the Giant which St. George destroyed;
and in the Earth have been decaying ever since, but now am come to Eat with you


To pick up your Cr^ms, Sir: You Are heartily Welcome.


I have lain now within the Stygian Lake 2000 Years.

Your Honor is not much shrunk in the Wetting.

But we loose Time, and Dinner cools.

Where is it?

In the next Room.

Will it please your Lustiness to lead the Way?

Will it please you then to make way for him?

I can divide my self to serve my Friends?
Breeches be you my Page, and follow me.

O heavenly Apparition!

Come, let us sit down.

Ha! What Is here, a Woman?

O happy Change! Madam, with your good Leave.

Never too late in good Breeding.
Wench! And us Luscious as Pig-sauc^.

Heaven be praised for all.

Your unseasonable Thankfulness has robbed us of our Strumpet.


No matter, no matter; we shall meet her in the Cloisters after the Fair. Come
let us fall too

Ha!


The Table runs away from us.


We'll bestow the Pains to follow it again; this I see is a running Banquet.


I have found the Secret: We must not say Grace at the Devil's Feast.


Come then let us fall too, San's Ceremony; Will you be Carver?


Every one for himself, I say.


Ay, every one for himself, and God for us all.


A Plague o'your Proverb; it has a Word in it must not be named.


Ah, Mr. Doctor, do but entreat Mr. Mephostopholis to let the Table down to us,
or send us tothat, and I Will he his Servant as long as I live


Oh, oh, oh.

Now have a care of another Proverb:
We go without our Supper.

Nay, now I know the Devil's Humor, I Will hit him to a Hair: Pray, Mr. Doctor,
cut up that Pasty


I cannot get my Knife into it, it is over-bak'd.


Ay, it is often so: God sends Meat, and the Devil sends Cooks.


Thou Varlet, do thou see what thy Proverb has done?


Now could I curse my Grandmother, for she taught 'em me: Well, if sweet
Mephostopholis will be so kind as but to let us and the Table come together
again, I Will promise never to say Grace, or speak Proverb more, as long as I
live


Your Prayers are heard, now be careful; for if I lose my Supper by thy
Negligence I Will cut thy Throat


Do, and eat me when you have do^e. I am damnably hungry; I Will cut open this
Pasty, while you open that Pot of wild Fowl


Here Is the Nest but the Birds are flown: Here Is Wine though, and now I Will
conjure for a Supper. I have a Sallad within of my own Garhering in the Fields
to Day


Fetch it in; Bread, Wine, and a Sallad, may serve for a Collation.


Come, no Ceremony among Friends. Bon. fro.

Sallad mal adjuste; here is neither Fat nor Lean.

O Mr. Doctor, neither Fat nor Lean in a Sallad.

Neither Oil, nor Vinegar.

Oh! I Will fetch you that presently.

O thy Sallad is nothing but Thistles and Netles; and thy Oil stinks worse than
Arse^etito


Bread and Wine be our Fare. Ha! the Bread's alive.


Or the Devil's in it. Hey! again.

My Belly's as empty as a Beggar's Purse.

And mine as full of Wind as a Trumpeter's Cheeks.
But since we cannot Eat, let us Drink: Come, here is Dr. Faustus's Health.


Ay, come; God bless Dr. Faustus.

What all gone: Here Is a Banquet stole away like a City Feast.


Ha! here is Music to delight us.

Ha! the Devil. We are locked in.

As fast as a Counter Rat.

OF o, of --.

HOW have I been delighted by thy Art; and in Twelve Years have seen the utmost
Limits of the spacious World; seasted my self with all Varieties; pleasur'd my
Fancy with my Magic Art, and lived sole Lord over every Thing I wished for


Ay, Faustus, is it not a splendid Life?


It is my Spirit; but prithee now retire, while I repose my self within this
Shade, and when I wake attend on me again


Faust, I will.


What art thou, Faustus, but a Man condemned. Thy Lease of Years expire apace;
and, Faustus, then thou must be Lucifers: Here rest my Soul, and in my Sleep my
future State be buried


Faustus, sweet Faustus, yet remember Heaven.
Oh! think upon the everlasting Pain thou must endure,
For all thy short Space of Pleasure.

Illusions, Fancies, Faustus; think of Eart^.
The Kings thou shall command: The Pleasutes Rule.
Be, Fa^stus, not a whining, pious Fool.

Oh! what a couz'ning Doctor was this: I riding my Horse into the Water,
thinking some hidden mystery had been in 'em, found my self on a Bundle of
Straw, and was dragged by Something in the Water, like a Bailiff through a
Horse-pond. Ha! he is a Sleep: So ho, Mr. Doctor, so ho. Why Doctor, you
couz'ning, wheedling, hypocritical, cheating, cho^sing, Son of a Whore; awake,
rise, and give me my Money again, for your Horse is turned into a Bottle of Hay.
Why Sirrah, Doctor; 's^oot I think he is dead. Why Doctor Scab; you mangy Dog.


O help! the Villain has undone me; Murder.


Murder, or not Murder, now he has but one Leg I Will outrun him.


Stop, stop him; ha, ha, ha, Faustus has his Leg again, and the Horse-courser a
Bundle of Have for his Forty Dollars. Come, Mephostopholis, let us now attend the
Emperor


Here Is to thee; and now I Will tell thee what I came hither for: You have heard
of a Conjurer they call Doctor Faustus


Heard of him, a Plague take him, I have Cause to know him; has he played any
Pranks* with you


I Will tell thee, as I was going to the Market a while ago, with a Load of Hay,
he met me, and asked me, What he should give me for as much Hay as his Horse
would Eat: Now, Sir, I thinking that a little would serve his Turn, bad him
take as much as he would for Three Farthings


So.


So he presently gave me Money, and fell to Eating: And as I Am a cursen Man, he
never left Yeating and Yeating, 'till he had eaten up my whole Load of Hay


Now you shall hear how he served me: I went to him Yesterday to buy a Horse of
him, which I did; and he bad me be sure not to ride him into the Water


Good.


Ad's Wounds 'twas Bad, as you shall hear: For I thinking the Horse had some
rare Quality, that he would not have me know, what do me I but rides him in the
Water; and when I came just in the midst of the River, I found my self a
Straddle on a Bottle of Hay


O rare Doctor!


But you shall hear how I served him bravely for it; for finding him a Sleep
just now in a By-Field, I whoop'd and hollowed in his Ears, but could not wake
him; so I took hold of his Leg, and never left pulling till I had pulled it
quite off


And has the Doctor but one Leg then? That Is Rare. But come, this is his House,
let us in and see for our Money; look you, we'll pay as we come back


Done, done; and when we have got our Money let us laugh at his one Leg: Ha, ha,
ha


What have the Rogues le^t my Pots, and run away, without paying their
Reckoning? I Will after 'em, cheating Villains, Rogues, Cut-purses; rob a poor
Woman, cheat the Spittle, and rob the King of his Excise; a parcel of Rustic,
Clownish, Pedantical, High-shoo'd, Plow-jobbing, Cart-driving, Pinch-back'd,
Paralytick, Fumbling, Grumbling, Bellowing, Yellowing, Peas-picking, Stinking,
Mangy, Runagate, Ill-begotten, Ill-contriv'd, Wry-mouthed, Spatrifying,
Dung^^ill-raking, Costive, Snorting, Sweaty, Farting, Whaw^rover Dogs


My Time draws near, and 20 Years are past: I have but Four poor Twelve Months
for my Life, and then I am damned for ever


O gentle Faustus, leave this damned Art; this Magic, that will charm thy Soul
to Hell, and quite bereave thee of Salvation: Though thou have now offended
like a Man, do not, oh! do not persist in it like a Devil. It may be this my
Exhortation seems harsh, and all unpleasant; let it not, for, gentle Son, I
speak in tender Love and Pity of thy future Misery; and so have hope that this
my kind Rebuke, checking thy Body, may preserve thy Soul


Where art thou, Faustus? Wretch, what have thou done? O Friend, I feel thy
Words to comfort my distressed Soul; retire, and let me ponder on my Sins


Faustus, I leave thee, but with grief of Heart,
Fearing thy Enemy will near depart.

Thou Traitor, I arrest thee for Disobedience to thy Sovereign Lord; revolt, or
I Will in piecemeal tear thy Flesh


I do repent I ever offended him; torment, sweet Friend, that old Man that
durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer


His Faith is great, I cannot touch his Soul; but What I can afflict his Body
with I will


We are come to drink a Health to your wooden Leg.


My wooden Leg; what do thou mean, Friend?


Ha, ^a! he has forgot his Leg.


P^ha, it is not a Leg he stands upon. Pray, let me ask you one Question; Are
both your Legs Bed-fellows


Why do thou ask?


Because I believe you have a good Companion of one.


Why, don't you remember I pulled off one o'your Legs when you were a Sleep?


But I have it again now I am awake.


Ad's Wounds, had the Doctor three Legs! --. You, Sir, don't you remember you
gave a Penny for as much Hay as your Horse would eat, and then eat up my whole
Load


Look you, Mr. Doctor, you must not carry it off so; I come to have the Money
again I gave for the Ho-o-o


And I come to be paid for my Load of Ha-a-a.


O Mr. Doctor! do you harbor Rogues that bilk poor ^olks, and wont pay their
Reck'nings? Who must pay me for my A-a-a-


Mr. Doctor, I cannot be quiet for your Devil Mr. Me-o-o --


Wonder of Men, thrice Learned Faustus, Renowned Magician, welcome to our
Court; and as thou late did promise us, I would behold the Famous Alexander
fighting with his great Rival Dari^s, in their true Shapes, and State
Majestical


Your Majesty shall see 'em presently.


It thou bring'st Alexander, or Dari^s here, I Will be content to be Act^^on, and
turn my self to a Stag


And I Will play Diana, and send you the Horns presently.


Away, be gone; see, my Gracious Lord, what Beast is that that thru^ts his Head
out of yo^' Window


O wondrous Sight! see tow Horns on young Benoolio's Head; call him, Lords.


What, ho! Benoolio.

A Plague upon you, set me Sleep.

Look up, Benoolio, it is the Emperor calls.

The Emperor; O my Head.

And thy Horns hold, it is no matter for thy Head.

Doctor, this is your Villainy.

O say not so, Sir; the Doctor has no Skill, if he bring Alexander or Dari^s
here you will be Act^^on, and turn to a Stag: Therefore, if it please your
Majesty, I Will bring a Kennel of Hounds to hunt him. Ho! Helmot, Argi^on,
As^erot


Hold, he will raise a Kennel of Devils. Good, my Lord, entreat.


Prithee remove his Horns, he has done Penance enough.


Away; and remember hereafter you speak well of Scholars.


If Scholars be such Cuckolds to put Horns upon honest Men's Heads, I Will never
trust Smooth-face and Small-band more: But if I been't revenged, may I be
turned to a Gaping Oyster, and drink nothing but Salt Water


Come, Faustus, in recompense of this high Desert, Thou shall command the State
of Germany, and live beloved of mighty Carol^s


Nay, sweet Benoolio, let us sway thy Thoughts from* this Attempt against the
Conjurer


My Head is lighter, than it was by the Horns:
And yet my Heart's more ponderous than my Head,
And pants, until I see the Conjurer dead.

Consider.

Away dissuade me not he comes:
Now Sword ^trike home*
For Horns he gave, I Will have his Head anon.

Oh, (...)

(...)
(...)

First, on this Scull, in qu^ttance of my Wrongs, I Will na^l huge ^orked Horns
within the Window where he yoked me first, that all the World may see my just
Revenge; and thus having settled his Head --


What shall the Body do, Gentlemen.

The Devil's alive again?

Give the Devil his Head again.

Nay, keep it; Faustus will have Heads and Hands:
I call your Hearts to recompense this Deed.
Ho; Asteroth, Belin^oth, Mephostopholis.
Go Horse these Traitors on your fiery Backs.
Drag 'em through Dir^ and Mud, through Thorns and Briers.

Pity us, gentle Faustus, save our Lives.

Away.

He must needs go whom the Devil drives.

I find this Scaramouche is a Villain; he has left the Doctor, and is come to
be Steward to a rich Widow, whose Husband dyed Yesterday, and here he is
coming to give the Poor their Doles, of which I Will have my Share


Come hither, poor Devils; stand in Order, and be Damned. I come to distribute
what your deceased good Master has bequeathed


God bless you, Mr. Steward.


Let me tell you, Gentlemen, he was as good a Man as ever piss't, or cried
Stand on the Highway

He spent a good Estate, it is true; but he was no Body's ^oe but his own. I
never left him while he was worth a Groat, this. Easter: The Meat that was
stale, and his Drink that was sour, was always yours.


So, setting the Here Is Head against the ^oose Giblets, he was a good
Hospitable Man; and much good may do you with what you had


I have had nothing.


Nor I^


Nor I.


Nor. I.


Nothing.


Nothing, nothing.


Nothing, nothing; you lying Rogues, then there is something for you.


So now I am Victual'd, I may hold our Siege against Hunger.

Ha! they are hunting a after me, and will kill me. Let me see, I will take
this Gi^bet for my Preserver, and with this long Cloak make as if I were
hanged. Now when they find a Man hanged, not knowing me in this Disguise,
they will look no farther after me, but think the Thie^^s hanged. -- I hear '^m
coming


Ha! what is here, a Man hanged? But what Paper is this is his Hand?

I have cheated the Poor of their Money, and took the Bread out of their Mouths,
for which I was much troubled in Conscience, fell into Despair, and, as you
see, hanged my self

O the Devil! Murder, murder!


O Neighbors, here hangs the Rogue.


Help me down?


No, you are very well as you are.


Don't you know me?


Ay, for a Rogue; even finish your Work, and save the Hangman a Labor. Yet,
now I think on it, self-murder is a crying Sin, and may damn his Soul. Come,
Neighbors, we'll take him down, and have him hanged according to Law


Stop Thief, stop Thief.


Thus from the infernal Dis do we ase^nd, bringing with us the Deed; the Time
is come which makes it forfeit


Yet, Faustus, call on Heaven.


O^! it is too late; behold, they lock my Hands.


Who, Faustus?


Luci^er and Mephos^opholis; I gave 'em my Soul for Four and twenty Years.


Heaven ^orbid.


Ay, Heaven forbad it indeed, but Faustus has done it; for the vain Pleasure of
Four and twenty Years* Faustus has lost eternal Joy and Felicity: I writ 'em a
Bill with my own Blood, the Date is expired; this is the Time, and they are
come to ^etch me


Why would not Faustus tell me of that before?


I often in^ended it, but the Devil threat'ned to tear me in Pieces. O Friend,
retire and save your self


I Will into the next Room, and their pray for thee.


Ay, pray for me; and what Noise soever you hear stir not, for nothing can
rescue me


Pray thou, and I Will pray. Adie^.


If I live till Morning I Will visit you; if not, (...) is go^ to Hell.


Ay, Faustus, now thou have no hopes on Heaven.


O thou bewitching Fi^nd; 'twas thou, and thy Temptations, has robbed me of
eternal Happiness


I do confess it, Faustus, and rejoice.
What weep'st thou, it is too late; hark to thy knell:
Fools that will Laugh on Earth, must Weep in Hell.

O Faustus, if thou had given Ear to me,
Innumerable Joys had followed thee:
But thou did love the World.

Gave Ear to me, and now must taste Hell's Pains perpetual.


Had thou a^^ected sweet Divinity,
Hell, nor the Devil, had no Power on thee.
Had thou kept on that way, Faustus, behold in what resplended
Glory thou had sat; that have thou Lost.
And now, poor Soul, must thy good Angel leave:
The Jaws of H^ll are ready to receive thee.

Now, Faustus, let thy Eyes with Horror stare
Into that Vast perpetual torturing House.

O I have seen enough to torture me.

Nay thou must feel 'em, 'taste the Smart of all.
He that loves Pleasure must for Pleasure ^all:
And so I leave thee, Faustus, till anon.
Thou Wilt ^umble into Confusion.

Now, Faustus, have thou but one bear Hour to Live,
And then thou must be Damned perpetually:
Stand still you ever-moving Spheres of Heaven,
That Time may cease, and Midnight never come.
Or le^ this Hour be but a Year, a Mon^h, a Week, a natural Day; that Faustus
may repent, and save his Soul. Mountains and Hills come, come, and ^all on me,
and hi^e me from the heavy Wrath of Heaven. Gape E^rth; Oh no, it will not
harbor me

Oh! half the Hour is past; 'twill all be past a^o^. Oh! if my Soul must suffer
for my Sin, impose some end to my incessant Pain. Let Faustus live in Hell a
Thousand Years, an Hundred thousand, and at last be saved. Lu^ifer; O
Mephostopholis


Come, Friend, let us visit Faustus: For such a dreadful Night was never seen.


O help us, Heaven; see here are Faustus's Limbs,
All torn asunder by the Hand of Hell.

May this a fair Example be to all,
To avoid such Ways which brought poor Faustus's Fall.
And whatsoever Pleasure does invite,
Sell not your Souls to purchase vain Delight.
