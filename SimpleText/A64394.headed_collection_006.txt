DEmipho the brother of Chremes was gone into another country,
Having left his son Antipho at Athens:
Chremes had closely a wife and a daughter at Lemnus,
And another wife at Athens, and a son that entirely loved
Lemnus
To Athens; she dies, and the maid alone (Chremes was absent)
Takes charge of the burial: when Antipho fell in love with her,
Having there got a sight of her, he by means of a parasite took her to wife.
Chremes being returned chafed at it^; afterward they gave
The parasite thirty pounds, that he himself might
Have her to wife: the singing-wench is bought with the ^ie.
Antipho retains his wife being owned by his uncle.
CHremetis frater aberat peregre Demipho,
Relicto Athenis Antiphone filio;
Chremes clam habebat Lemni uxorem at filia^,
Athenis aliam conjugem, and amantem uni^e
Lemno advenit
Athenas, moritur; virgo sola (aberat Chremes)
Funus procurat: ibi eam visam Antipho
Cum amaret, opera parasiti uxorem accipit.
Chremes reversi fremere; dehinc minas
Triginta dant parasito, ut illam conjugem
Haberet ipse: argento emitut fidicina.
U^orem retinet Antipho a patruo ag^i^am.
SInce the old Poet is not able to withdraw our Poet
From his endeavors, and make the man to sit idle,
He goes about by ill-words to affright him, that he may not write.
Who often says thus; that the Comedies which he made heretofore

Because he nowhere writ that a distracted young man
Saw the hind in chase, and the dogs to be in pursuit;
And that she made moan, and entreated some body to help her.
But if he understood, that when that Comedy being now long ago pleased,

He would be far less bold to censure, then he is now to censure,
And what comedies he made would please better.
Now if there be any one, who says or thinks thus,
If the old Poet had not provoked him first,

To say, unless he had some body to rail on:
Let him take this for an answer to him; that the prize
Is publicly propounded to all that profess Poetry.
He strove to drive this man from his study to starve;

If he had striven in better words, he had had good words:
Let him consider, that what he brought is paid him again.
I will now make an end of speaking of him,
Seeing he makes no end of offending concerning himself.

A new Comedy, which the Greeks call Epidicazomenos,
And the Latins name Phormio:
Because that he shall act the chiefest parts, will be Phormio
The Parasite, by whom the matter will especially be carried on.

Do your endeavor, attend patiently in silence;
That we may not have such fortune as we had
When our company was driven from their standing by a tumult,
Which standing our actors excellency, and your goodness

POstquam Poeta vetus Poetam non potest
Retrahere a studio, and tradere hominem in otiu^,
Maledictis deterrere, ne scribat, parat:
Qui ita dictitat; quas antehac fecit fabulas,

Quia nusquam insanum scripsit adolescentulum
Cervam videre fugere, and sectari canes;
Et eam plorare, orare ut subveniat sibi.
Quod si intelligeret, cum stetit olim nova,

Minus multo audacter, quam nunc laedit, laederet,
Et magis placerent quas fecisset fabulas.
Nunc si quis est qui hoc dicat, aut sic cogitat,
Vetus si poeta non lacessisset prior,

Quem diceret, nisi haberet cui malediceret:
Is sibi responsum hoc habeat; in medio omnibus
Palmam esse positam, qui a^tem tractant musicam.
Ille ad famem hunc ab studio studuit rejicere;

Benedictis si certasset, audisset been:
Quod ab ipso allatum est, sibi esse id relatum pute^.
De illo jam finem faciam dicundi mihi,
Peccandi cum ipse de se finem non facit.

Epidicazomenon quam vocant Comoediam
Graeci; Latini Phormionem nominant;
Quia primas parts qui aget, is erit Phormio
Parasitus, per quem res geretur maxim.

Date operam, adeste aequo animo per silentium;
Ne simili utamur fortuna atque usi sumus,
Cum per tumultum noster grex motus a loco est;
Quem actoris virtus nobis restituit lo^um,

MY special friend and countrie-man Geta
Came to me yesterday; there remained to him
A very little money of a small reckoning with me
A good while ago, that I might get it up; I have got it up, I bring it him.

A wife; I believe this present is scraped together for him.
How ill it is ordered, that they who have less,
Should always add something to them that are richer?
For that which he poor man spared with much ado inchmoal

She will snatch it all away, not considering
With what great pains it was gotten: and besides Geta
Shall be charged with another present, when his mistress is brought to bed,
And then with another, when the childe's birthday shall be kept,

The child shall be the cause of sending. But do I not see Geta?

AMicus summus meus and popularis Geta
Heri ad me venit; erat ei de ratiuncula
Jampridem apud me reliquum pauxillulum
Nummorum; id ut conficerem, confeci; affero.

Uxorem, ei credo munus hoc conraditur.
Quam inique comparatum est; hi qui minus habent,
Ut semper aliquid addant ditioribus!
Quod ille nunciatim vix de demenso suo,

Id illa universum abripiet, haud existumans
Quanto labor partum: porro autem Geta
Ferietur alio munere, ubi hera pepererit,
Porro alio autem, ubi erit puero natalis dies,

Puer causa erit mittundi. Sed videon' Getam?

IF any red-haired man shall seek me --

He is here at hand, say no more.

Oh?
But Davus I endeavored to meet you:

Take it, here;
It is picked money, there is the full sum, as much as I ought you.

I like you, and give you thanks that you have not neglected.


If one restore a thing, he must have great thanks given him.
But why are you sad?

What I? You wot in what fear,
And in how great peril we are.

What is that?

You shall know,
So that you can keep it close.

Go your way, you fool,

You have seen in money? wherein, what advantage is it for me
To deceive you?

Nearken then.

I will do so much for you.

Davus, do you know Chremes our old man's elder brother?

What else?

What? do you know his son Phaedria?



It fell out that both the old men had a journie
At one time, he into Lemnus, and our master into Sicily,
To an old acquaintance; he allured the old man by letters
Promising him almost golden mountains.

To him that had so much, and more then enough?

Say no more,


Oh, I should have been a King.

Then both the old men departing hence left me
As it were a tutor to their sons.

O Geta, you undertook
A heavy charge.

I am used to this, I know.
I remember I was left, because my God was displeased with me.

Whilst I am faithful to the old man, I have lost the use of my arms.

I considered those things; for it is a folly
To hit ones heels against the Prick.

I began to do every thing
For them, to humor them in what they would have.

You know how to make your market.

Phaedria
Out of hand got a certain minstrelless: he began to be deep in love with her;
She was servant to a most filthy hawd;
Neither had their fathers taken order, that they should have any thing to
give
There was nothing else for them to do, but to feed their eyes,

We having little to do attended upon Phaedria.
In this school where she learned, over against the place
Was a kind of barber's shop; here commonly we used
For the most part to tarry for her, till she came home thence;
In the mean time, as we sat there, there came upon us
A young man weeping, we wondered;
We ask^ him what the matter was; Never did poverty, says he,
Seem to me such a miserable and beavie burden;
I saw even now in this street a poor maid

She was set over against her; neither was there any body with her,
Neither one that wished her well, nor acquaintance, nor kinsman,
Except a silly old woman, that might help the burial; I pitied her;
The maid her self is very fair; what needs many words?
Antipho presently,
Are you willing we should go see her? I think it meet, says another.
Let us go, bring us thither we pray you; we go, we come,
We see; the maid was fair, and that you may the rather say it,
She had nothing to help her beauty,

She was all tears, her clothes were foul, so that unless there had been a
force of grac
In her beauty, these things would have extinguished it by force.
He that loved the singing-wench, said only,
She is pretty enough. But our youngster.

I know already;


Do you know with whom? mind what it may come to;
The day after he goes on straight to the old-woman, he beseeches her;
That she would grant him the liberty on her; but she said she would not,
Neither did she do what was fitting; that she was a citizen of Athens,
A good women, born of good parents; If he would marry her,
He might do it by law, but if otherwise, she said nay.

To marry her, and be was afraid of his father that was absent.

Would his father, if he had returned, have given him leave?

What he? would he bestow on him a maid that had no portion, and


What became of it at last?

What should come of it? There is one Phormio a parasite,
An audacious fellow, who, a mischief take him.

What did he?

He gave this advice which I will tell you.
There is a law, that the fatherless and motherlesse maids should be married
To them that are next akin, and the same law enjoyneth the (...) to marry
them
I will say you are her kins-man, and will entertain an action against you;
I will feign that I am the maid's father's friend,
We will come before the judges; I will devise all these things,
Who was her father, who who was her mother, how she is a-ki^ (...) you,

When you shall gainsay none of these things, I shall overcome to be sure.
Your father will be here, suits shall be commenced against me. What is that to
me
She shall be ours indeed.

A merry bold-trick!

He persuaded the man, it is done; we come, we are cast;


What say you?

That which you hear.

O Geta,
What will become of you?

Truly I know not; this one thing I know,
What fortune shall afford, we will take patiently.

Content.
Oh that is the duty of a man.

All my hope is in my self.

I commend you.

I think I must go to some spoke^n that may

If he shall do any thing, I will not entreat for him; only
Let him not add; when I am gone hence, even kill him quite out.

What does that Usher that loves the minstrelless?
What does he?

Thus, poorly.

He has not much.


No nothing, but mere hope.

Is his father returned, or no?

Not yet.

What?
How long do you look for the old man?

I know not certainly,
But I hear that a letter was brought us lately from him,
And that it was carried to the custom house men; I will go fetch it.

Geta.

That you may do well.
Boy, he, does no body come forth hither? Take it, give this to Dorcius.

SI quis me quaeret rufus --

Praesto est, define.

Oh!
At ego obviam conabar tibi,

D. Accipe, hem*
Lectum est, conveniet numerus, quantum debui.

Amo te, and non neglexisse, gratiam habeo.


Si quis quid reddit, magna habenda gratia est.
Sed quid tu es tristis?

Egone? scis quo in metu, and
Quanto in periculo nos sumus?

Quid istuc est?

Scies,
Modo ut tacere possis.

Abi sis, insciens,

Verere ei verba credere? ubi quid mihi lucri est
Te fallere?

Ergo ausculta.

Hanc operam tibi dico.

Senis nostri, Dave, fratrem majorem Chremem
Nostin'?

Quidni?

Quid? Ejus gnatum Phaedriam?



Evenit senibus ambobus simul
Iter, illi in Lemnum, ut esset, nostro in Siciliam,
Ad hospitem antiquum; is senem per epistolas
Pellerit; modo non montes auri pollicens.

Cui tanta erat res, and superaret?

Desinas.


O, regem me esse oportuit.

Abeuntes ambo hinc tum senes, me filiis
Relinquunt quasi magistrum.

O Geta,
Provinciam cepisti duram.

Mihi usu venit hoc, scio.
Memini relinqui me Deo irato meo.

Seni fidelis dum sum, scapulas perdidi.

Venere in mentem mihi isthaec; namque inscitia est
Advorsum stimulum calces.

Cepi his omnia
Facere, obsequi quae vellent.

Scisti uti foro.


Continuo quandam nactus est puellulam
Ci haristriam; hanc amare cepit perdite;
Ea serviebat lenoni impurissimo;
Neque, quod daretur quicquam, id cu^a^ tres:
Restabat aliud nihil, nisi oculos pascere;

Nos otiosi operam dabamus Phaedriae.
In quo haec discebat ludo, ex adverso ei loco*
Tonstrina erat quaedam; hic solebamus (...)
Plerunque eam operiri, dum inde iret do^;
Iiis nubant, and illos ducere eadem lex haec jubet.
Ego te cognatum dicam, and tibi scribam dicam,
Paternum amicum me assimilabo virginis;
Ad judices veniemus qui fuerit pater,
Quae matter, qui cognata tibi sit, omnia haec

Cum tu horum nihil refelles, vincam scilicet.
Pater aderit, mihi paratae lites. Quid mea?
Illa quidem nostra erit.

Joculam audaciam!

Persuasit homini; factum est; ventum est; vincimur;


Quid narras?

Hoc quod audis.

O Geta,
Quid te defuturum est?

Nescio hercle, unum hoc scio,
Quod fors feret. feremus aequo animo.

Placet.
Ehem istuc viri est officium?

In me omnis mihi spes est.

Laudo.

Ad precatorem abeam credo, qui mihi

Posthac si quicquam, nihil precor; tantummodo
Non addat; ubi ego hinc abiero, vel occidito.

Quid paedagogus ille qui citharistriam?
Quid rei gerit?

Sic, tenuiter.

Non multum habet


Immo nihil, nisi spem meram.

Pater ejus rediit an non?

Nondum.

Quid? senem
Quoad exspectatis vostrum?

Non certum scio;
Sed epistolam ab eo allatam esse audivi modo,
Et ad portitores esse latam: hanc petam.

Geta, aliud me vis?

Ut been sit tibi.
Puer, heus, nemon' huc prodit? Cape, da hoc Dorcio.

THat the matter should come to this pass, Phaedria, that I should be afraid
of my father
Who would have me very well provided for, when I think of his coming?
Whereas, if I had not been so inconsiderate, I might have expected him, as it
was meet

What is the matter?

Do you ask, that art privy with me to so bold a prank?
Phormio's mind to persuade me to it,
And that he had not forced me being desirous thitherward, which is the
beginning of mischief
Had I not obtained her, then it had gone heavily with me for some days,
But this daily care would not have troubled my mind.

I hear you.

Whilst I expect how quickly he may come, that may take srom me this
familiarity with her


Antipho, you are glutted with love; for truly this kind of life of yours
Is to be desired and wished; I wish I were so fairly blessed,
As that I might enjoy that which I love so long.
Now I desire to die; do you suppose the rest:

That I may not add that you have without cost got one that is honest and
well-favoured
That you have as you desired, a wife of no ill report abroad,
You are happy, except this one thing be wanting, a mind that may bear these
things-moderatelie
But if you had to do with that bawd that I have to deal with, then you would
perceive it


But you, Phaedri^, on the contrary me thinks are fortunate,
That have power yet in your hand to advise what you desire;
To hold her, to love her, or let her go, I unhappie man am fallen into that
condition
That I have neither power to let her go, nor liberty to keep her.

It is just he, I am afraid poor man what thing he now comes to tell me.

ADeo^' rem rediisse, qui mihi consultum optime velit esse,
Phaedria, patrem ut extimescam, ubi in mentem ejus adventus venit?
Quod ni fuissem incogitans, ita ^um exspectarem, ut par fuit.

Quid istuc est?

Rogitas, qui tam audacis facinoris mihi conscius sis?

Neu me cupidum eo impulisset, quod mihi principium est mali.
Non potitus essem, fuisset tum illos mihi aegre aliquot dies:
At non quotidiana haec cura angeret animum.

Audio.

Dum expecto, quam mox veniat, qui hanc mihi adimat consuetudinem.


Amore abundas, Antipho; nam tua quidem hercle certo
Vita haec expetenda optandaque est. Ita me Diibene ament,
Ut mihi liceat tam diu quod amo frui.
Jam depacisci morte cupio: tu conjicito cae^era;

Ut ne addam, quod sine sumptu, ingenuam, liberalem nactus es;
Quod habes ut voluisti, uxorem sine mala fama palam,
Beatus es, ni unum hoc desit, animus qui modeste istae^ ferat;
Quod si tibi res cum eo lenone sit, quocum mihi est, tum sentias.


At tu mihi contra nune videre fortunatus, Phaedria,
Cui de integro est potestas etiam consulendi quid velis:
Retinere, amare, amittere: ego in cum incidi infaelix locum,
Ut neque mihi vis sit amittendi, nec retinendi copia.

Is est ipsus: timeo miser quam hic mihi nunc nunciet rem.

YOu are undone, Geta, except you can quickly find out some shift for you,
So many mischiefs on a sudden hang over you being unprovided,
Which I neither know how to avoid, nor how to get my self out of them;
For our boldness can be concealed no longer,


Why comes he in a chafe?

I have but a moment of time
For this matter. Here is my master.

What mischief is that?

Which when he shall hear, what remedy shall I find for his anger?
Should I speak? I shall incense him; should I hold my peace? I should set him
on: should I clear my self? I should lose my labor

I pity him, I am afraid for him: he now holds me, for but for him,
I would have looked well to my self, and would have been revenged of the
old-mans anger
I would have packed up something, and betaken my self hence to my heels
forthwith

What running away or theeving does he provide for?

But where shall I find Antipho?


He names you.

I know not
What great mischief I expect by this messenger.

Are you in your wits?

I will go on homeward,
There he is the most.

Let us call the fellow back.

Stand presently.

Ho, imperiously enough spoken, whosoever you are.

Geta, it is he himself
Whom I would meet with.

Tell me, I pray you, what news you bring, and if you can, dispatch in a word.



Speak out.

I saw your father just now at the port.

What mine?

Have you understood me.

I am undone.

What now?

What should I do?

What say you?

That I saw this man's father your uncle.

For what remedy can I poor man find on a sudden for this undoing?
But if my fortunes come to this Phanium, that I be parted from you,
I shall desire to live no longer.

Seeing then these things are so, Antipho,


I am not my self.

But now Antipho it is very needful you should be;
For if your father perceive you to be fearful, he will think
You have deserved blame.

This is true.

I cannot be altered.

What would you do, if you were to do some weightier matter?



O Phaedria, this is nothing; you may be gone.
Why do we spend our labor in vain? but I must be gone.

And so must I truly.

I pray you, what if I counterfeit? is this enough?

You prate.

Look me in the face,
Is it enough thus?

No.

What if I look thus?

It is almost well enough.

What if I look thus?

That is enough.
Ho, hold you there: and be sure you answer word for word, like for like,


I know your meaning.

Tell him you were constrained by force against your will, by Law, by
judgment; do you understand me
But what old man is this that I see in the further end of the streat?

It is he himself.
I cannot abide to be by.

Alas, what say you? whither go you, Antipho?
Tarry, tarry, I say.

I know my self, and my own offense;


Geta, what shall we do now?

You shall now hear his chiding, I shall be hanged, unless I be mistaken.
But that which erewhile we advised Antipho here, we must do it our selves,
Phaedria.

Away with this Must, and rather do you will me what I shall do.

Do you not remember what your speech was heretofore in beginning the matter,

Able to overcome, very good.

I remember it.

Lo, now
We have need of it, or if you can do any thing, a better and more tra^tie one.

It shall be done
With all dillgence.

Now do you go first to him; I will be here in ambush
Ready to make a supply, if you shall fail in any thing.

Go to then.

NUllus es, Geta, nisi ^am aliquid tibi consilium c^l^^e reppereris,
Ita nunc imparatum subito tanta te impendent mala:
Quae neque uti devitem scio, neque quo modo me inde extraham;
Nam non potest celari nostra diutius audacia;


Quidnam ille commotus venit?

Tunc ^emporis mihi punctu^
Ad hanc rem est. Herus adest.

Quid illud mali est?

Quod cum audierit, quod ejus remedium inveniam i^racundiae?
Loquarne? incendam; taceam? instigem; purgem me? laterem lavem.

Ejus me miscret, ei nunc timeo; is nunc me retinet; namque absque eo esset,
Recte ego mihi vidissem, and senis essem ultus iracundiam:
Aliquid convasissem, atque hinc me conjicerem protinus in pedes.

Quam hic fugam, aut furtum parat?

Sed ubi Antiphonem reperiam?


Te nominat.

Nescio quod
Magnum hoc nuncio expecto malum.

Sanus es?

Domum ire pergam:
Ibi plurimum est.

Revocemus hominem.

Sta illico.

Hem, satis pro imperio, quisquis es.

Geta.

Ipse est quem volui
Obviam.

Cedo, quid portas, obsecro? atque id si potes verbo expedi:



Eloquere.

Modo apud portum patrem.

Meumne?

Intellex^in'.

Occidi.

Hem.

Quid agam?

Quid ais?

Hujus patrem vidisse me patruum tuum.

Nam quod ego huic nunc subito exitio remedium inveniam miser?
Quod si eo meae fortunae redeunt, Phanium, abs te ut abstrahar,
Nulla est mihi vita expetenda.

Ergo istaec cum ita sint, Antipho,


Non sum apud me.

Atqui opus est nunc cum maxume ut sis, Antipho:
Nam si senserit te timidum pater esse, arbitrabitur
Commeruisse culpam.

Hoc verum est.

Non possum immutarier.

Quid faceres, si aliud quid gravius tibi nunc faciendum foret?



Hoc nihil est Phaedria, ilicet.
Quid conterimus operam frustra? quin abeo.

Et quidem ego.

Obsecro, quid si assimulabo? satin' est?

Garris.

Vultum contemplamini;
Satin' sic est?

Non.

Quid si sic?

Propemodum.

Quid si sic?

Sat est.
Hem istuc serva: and verbum verbo, par pari ut respondeas,


Scio.

Vi coactum esse te invitum, lege, judicio: tenes?
Sed quis hic est senex quem video in ultima platea.

Ipsus est.
(...) possum adesse.

Ah, quid ais? quo a^is, Antipho?
Mane, mane, inquam.

Egomet me novi and peccatum meum;


Geta. Quid nunc fiet?

Tu jam lites audies; ego plectar pendens, nisi quid me fefellerit.
Sed quod modo h^c nos Antiphonem monuimus, id nosmetipsos facere
Oportet, Phaedria.

Aufer mihi Oportet; quin tu quid faciam
Impera.

Meministin' olim ut ^uerit vostra oration in re

Vincibilem, optumam.

Memini.

Hem, nunc
Ipsa est opus, aut si quid potes, meliore and callidiore.

Fiet
Sedulo.

Nunc prior adito tu; ego in insidiis hic ero
Succenturiatus, si quid deficies.

Age.

Is it so at last, has Antipho married a wife without my bidding?
And did he not fear my authority? well, I let authority go; did he not fear
my displeasur
At the least, was he not ashamed? O bold attempt, O Geta
The prompter on.

With much ado at last.

What will they say to me, or what excuse will they find?
I wonder.

But I have found one already, care you for something else.

Will they say this to me?
I did it against my will, the law constrained me, I hear and I confess it.

It likes me well.

But that he should wittinglie and holding his peace betray his cause to his
adversaries
What did the law force him to that?

That is a hard thing to answer.

I will help you out with it, let him alone.

I know not what to do, because this has befallen me besides what I looked
for, and as a thing not to be believed

Wherefore it behooveth all when they are most in prosperity, to think very
muc
With themselves, how they can endure the misery of adversity;
Let him that returns from a strange country, always consider of dangers,
banishments, losses
Or his sons misdemeanour, or his wives death, or his daughters sickness,

That he reckon all that as gained, whatsoever happens beyond expectation.

O Phaedria, it is a thing not to be believed, how far I exceed my master in
wisdom
I have thought on all the discommodities that may come to me; that if my
master return
I must grind continually in the bake-house; I must be beaten; I must have
shackles on

I will reckon all that as gained, whatsoever shall happen beyond my
expectation
But why do you forbear to go to the man, and at first to salute him kindly?

I see my brothers son Phaedria coming to meet me,

O my uncle, God save you.

God save you. But where is Antipho?



I believe you; answer me this.

He is well, he is here. But are all things sufficiently according to your
mind

I wish indeed they were.

What is that?

Do you ask, Phaedria?
You have made a good marriage here, whilst I was away.

Why, are you angry with him for that now?

O gallant craftsman!


I had him brought me into my sight, that he may know now, that through his own
defaul
That gentle father of his is become a very sharp man.

But he has done nothing, uncle, for which you should be angry.

But ^o all things are alike, they are all of a ^eather,


It is not so.

This my son is in the fault, and he is here to defend his cause,
When he is in the fault, this my son is ready at hand; they help one another.

The old man at unawares has finely painted out their doings.

For except these things were so, you would not take his part, Phaedria.

Antipho has committed a fault against himself,
Whereby he might be less respectful of an estate or good name,
I do not plead his cause, but let him suffer what he has deserved.
But if any one perhaps presuming on his own naughty si b^ilitie,
Has laid wait for our youth,

Who do often through envy take away from a rich man,
Or for pity give to a poor man?

But that I know the cause, I should think this man spoke true.

Is there any judge, that can kn^w your just matters,

So as he has done?

He has done the duty
Of an ingenuous man, after he came to the judges,
He could not utter what he thought,
Bashfulness did so daunt him being fearful.


Master, God save you: I am glad you are come safe.

O, good keeper, God save you, the main stay indeed of our house,
To whom I committed my son at my going hence.

I heard erewhile that you accuse us all

For what would you have me to do for you in this business?
The laws permit not a man that is a servant to plead.
Neither has he liberty to bear witness.

I let all those things pass,
Put in this too; the indiscreet young man was afraid, I grant it:

It was not necessary for him to have her, but that which the law commands,
You should have given her a portion, she should have sought another husband.
For what reason did he rather marry a woman that had nothing, and bring her
home

A reason was not wanting, but money.

He should have taken it up


Somewhere or other? There is nothing more easy to be said.

At last, if by no other means, yet upon usurie.

Whoo.
You have spoken finely, if so be any body would trust him,
Whilst you are alive.

No. It is not like to be thus: it cannot be.
Should I suffer her being married with him one day?

Beshewed to me, or that it be shown me where he dwells.

You mean Phormio.

That the woman's defendant.

I will cause that he shall be here by and by.

Where is Antipho now?

Abroad.

Go your way, Phaedria, seek for him, and bring him hither.

I go,


You mean to Pamphila.

And I will step aside home hence to pray to my houshold-Gods.
Thence will I go to the market, and call some
Friends to me, who may be by at the handling this matter,
That I may not be unprovided when Phormio comes.

ITane tandem uxorem duxit Antipho injuss^ meo?
Nec meum imperium? age, mitto imperium, non simultatem meam
Revereri saltem, non pudere? O facinus audax, O Geta
Monitor.

Vix tandem.

Quid mihi dicem, aut quam causam reperient,
Demiror.

Atqui repperi jam, aliud cura.

A^ hoc dicent mihi?
Invitus feci, lex coegit'; audio, and fateor.

Placet.

Verum scientem, tacitum causam tradere adversariis,
Etiamne id lex coegit?

Illud durum.

Ego expediam, sine.

Incertum est quid agam, quia praeter spem atque incredibile hoc mihi obtigit,

Quamobrem omnes, cum secundae res sunt maxume, tum maxume
Meditari secum oportet, quo pacto advorsam aerumnam serant:
Pericula, exilia, damna, peregre redien^ semper cogit^t,
Aut filii peccatum, aut uxoris mortem, aut morbum filiae;

Quidquid praeter spem evenit, omne id deputare esse in lucro.

O Phaedria, incredile est, quanta herum anteo sapientia,
Meditata sunt mihi omnia mea incommoda: herus si redierit,
Molendum esse usque in pistrino; vapulandum: habendae compedes:

Quicquid praeter spem evenie^, omne id deputabo esse in lucro.
Sed quid cessas hominem adire, and blande in principio alloqui?

Phaedriam mei fratris video filium mihi ire obviam.

Mi patrue, salve.

Salve; sed ubi est Antipho?



Credo: responde hoc mihi.

Valet; hic est. Sed satin' omnia ex sententia?

Vellem quidem.

Quid istuc est?

Rogitas, Phaedria? Bo^s, me absente, hic confecistis nuptias.

Eho, an id succenses nunc illi?

O artificem probum!


Dari mihi in conspectum, nunc sua culpa ut sciat
Lenem patrem illum factum esse acerrimum.

Atqui nihil fecit, patrue, quod succenseas.

Ecce autem similia omnia, omnes congruunt,


Haud ita est.

Hic in noxia est, ille ad defendendam causam adest.
Cum ille est, hic praesto est; tradunt operas mutuas.

Probe horum facta imprudens depinxit senex.

Nam ni haec ita essent, cum illo haud stares, Phaedria.

Antipho in se admiserit,
Ex qua re minus rei foret aut famae temperans,
Non causam dico, quin quod meritus sit, ferat.
Sed si quis forte, malitia fretus sua,
Insidias nostrae fe^it adolescentiae,

Qui saepe propter invidiam adimunt diviti,
Aut propter misericordiam addunt pauperi?

Ni nossem causam crederem vera hunc loqui,

An quisquam judex est, qui possit noscere

Ita ut ille fecit?

Functus adolescentuli est
Officium liberalis, postquam ad judices
Ventum est, non potuit cogitata proloqui.
Ita eum tum timidum obstupefecit pudor.


Here, salve: salvum te advenisse gaudeo.

Oh, bono custos, salve, columen vero familiae.
Cui commendavi filium hinc abiens meum.

Jamdudum te omnes nos accusare audio

Nam quid me in hac re facere voluist^ tibi?
Servum hominem causam dicere leges non sinunt,
Neque testimonii dictio est.

Mitto omnia.
Add istuc, imprudens timuit adolescens, sino:

Non fuit necesse habere, sed id quod lex jubet,
Dotem daretis, quaereret alium virum.
Qua ratione inopem potius ducebat ad domum?

Non ratio, verum argentum deerat.

Sumeret


Alicunde? nihil est dictu facilius.

Postremo, si nullo alio pacto, vel faenore.

Hui,
Dixti pulcre, siquidem quisquam crederet
Te vivo.

Non, non sic futurum est, non potest.
Egone illam cum illo ut patiar nuptam unum diem?

Mihi istum volo, aut ubi habitat demonstrarier.

Nempe Phormionem.

Istum patronum mulieris.

Jam faxo aderit.

Antipho ubi nunc est?

Foris.

Abi, Phaedria, eum require, atque adduce huc.

Eo,


Nempe ad Pamphilam.

At ego Deos penates hinc salutatum domum divortar.
Inde ibo ad forum, atque aliquot mihi
Amicos advocabo, ad h^nc rem qui adsient,
Ut ne imparatus sim cum adveniat Phormio.

SAy you so, that ^e being afraid of the sight of his father, went hence away?

He was very much afraid.

And that Phanium was left alone.

Yes.

And that the old man was angry?

Very greatly.

The weight of the business is laid upon thee only, Phormio,
Thou thy self have stamped this, you must eat it up: buckle to thy work.



If he shall ask?

My hope is in thee.

Behold the matter,
What if he shall restore her?

You forced him to her.

So I think.

Help us.

Give me the old man, now all my devises are fitted in my mind.

What will you do?

What would you have me to do, but that Phanium may tarry, and that I may
acqui
Antipho of this fault, and derive all his fathers anger upon my self.

Phormio, I am often in fear of this,
Lest this strengh of your sinews break at last.

Tush,
It is not so, I have made trial: I know which way to shift already,
How many m^n do you think now I have beaten almost to death,
Strangers? then Citizens? the better I knew them, so much the oftener I beat
them


Why that?

Because the net is not laid for the hawk, and the kite,
That do harm to us, but it is spread for those that do us no harm;
Because in these there is profit, in those we fool away our pains.
Others are in danger from others, from whom something may be gotten:

They will not maintain a greedy fellow: and they are wise in my judgment,
If they will not do a main good turn for an ill turn.

Thanks can never be given sufficiently according to your desert.

Nay indeed no man requites his King sufficiently according to his deserts.

Having your heart at ease, when he is spent both with care and co^^;
Whilst you have what delights you, he is fretted; you may laugh,
You may drink first, you may sit down first; a doubtful supper is set before
you

What word is that?

Where you may doubt, what you should take first.

To him that bestows them, would not you account him altogether? God at hand.

The old man is here; have a care what you do; the first brunt is very sharp,
If you can abide it, after it, you may play as you please.

ITane patris ais conspectum veritum hinc abiisse.

Admodum.

Phanium relictam solam?

Sic.

Et iratum senem?

Oppido.

Ad te summa solum Phormio rerum redit.
Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est exedendum: accingere.



Si rogitabit.

In te spes est.

Eccere.
Quid si reddet?

Tu impulisti.

Sic opinor.

Subveni.

Cedo senem: jam mihi instructa sunt cord consilia omnia.

Quid ages?

Quid vis? nisi ut maneat Phanium, atque a crimine hoc
Antiphonem eripiam, atque omnem in me iram derivem patris?

Phormio.
Vereor, ne isthaec fortitudo nervorum erumpat denique.

Ah,
Non ita est, factum est periculum; jam pedum visa est via.
Quot me censes homines jam deverberasse usque ad necem,
Hospites? tum cives? quo magis novi, tanto saepius.


Quid isthuc?

Quia non rete accipitri tenditur, neque milvo,
Qui male faciunt nobis, illis qui nihil faciunt tenditur.
Quia enim in illis fructus est, in illis opera luditur.
Aliis aliunde est periculum, unde aliquid abradi potest:

Alere nolunt hominem adacem: and sapiunt mea quidem sententia,
Pro maleficio si beneficium summum nolunt reddere.

Non potest satis pro merito ab illo tibi referri gratia.

Imo enim nemo satis pro merito gratiam regi refert.

Otiosum ab animo, cum ille and cura and sumptu absumitur;
Dum tibi sit quod placeat, ille ringitur; tu rideas,
Prior bibas, prior decumbas: coena dubia adponitur.

Quid istuc verbi est?

Ubi tu dubites quid sumas potissimum.

Ea qui praebeat, number tu hunc habeas plane praesentem Deum?

Senex adest, vide quid agas: prima coitio est acer^ima.
Si eam sustinueris, post illam, jam ut lubet, ludas licet.

Lo! have you ever heard, that an injury was ever done
More despitefullie to any man, then is done to me?
Come ye hither, I pray you.

He is angry.

But will you mind this business.
I will vex him by and by. O monstrous strange!
Demipho deny Phanium to be a kin to him?
Does Demipho deny this woman to be a kin to him?

He does deny it

And does he say that he knew not her father, who he was?

He says, not.

I think this is he, of whom I spoke, follow ye me.

And does he say, he knew not Stilpho, who he was?

He says, not.


She is neglected; See, what covetousness does.

If you shall accuse my master of that is naught, I will tell you your name.

O the boldness of a fellow, what does he come of his own accord to accuse me?

For now there is no cause why I should be angry with the young man,

And poor; one that got his living by his labor, he kept himself
Commonly in the country, there he had ground of my father
To till; in the meantime the old man did oftentimes
Tell me, that his kinsman neglected him:


See how you commend him and your self.

Get you gone and be hanged.
For unless I thought him to be such a one, I would never procure such heavy
displeasur
For this woman's sake against our family,
Which he now scorneth so dishonestlie.



But he deserves this.

Say you so, you goal-bird.

Geta.

You extortioner of goods, you wrester of laws.

Geta.

Answer him.

What man is this, ho?

Hold your tongue.

Demipho,
He has never ceased to give out railing speeches,

Against you when you were absent.

Give over.
Young Man, first of all I desire this of you by your good leave,
If it may please you to make me an answer.
What friend of yours do you say that man was? make it plain to me.


You fish it out so, as if you did not know him.

Did I know him?

Yes.

But I say I did not: do you that say I knew him, bring him to my remembrance.

Ho! did not you know your cousin-german?

You kill me quite out.
Tell me his name.

His name? yes.

Why do you now hold your peace?



Ho. what do you say?

Geta,
If you remember that which I once told you, put me in mind. Ho,
I will not tell you, as though you did not know you come to pump me.

Do I pump you?

Stilpho.

And indeed what is it to me?
It is Stilpho.

Whom did you mention?

I say, did not you know Stilpho?


A kin to me.

What so? are you not ashamed of these things?
But if he had left an estate of ten talents.

A mischief light on thee.

You would be the first man
To reckon your pedigree by heart as far as your grandfather and
greatgrandfather


How she had been my kinswoman.

Ho! our master, well done; ho you! look to your self.

I made it clear to the judges, to whom I ought,
If then it had been false, why did not your fon
Refute it?

Do you tell me of my son?


But you, that are a wise man, go to the magistrates;
That they may give you a sentence again of the same matter.
Forasmuch as you alone bear sway, and it is lawful for you only,
To get a judgment twice here concerning the same case.


Rather then I would follow suitors, or rather then I would hear you,
Just as she were my kinswoman, because the law enjoineth,
To give her a portion, have her away, and take five pounds.

Ha, ha, he, a merry world!

What is the matter? do I desire any thing that is not fair?


Is it so forsooth I pray you, when you have abused her, like a whore,
Does the law bid you give her a reward and let her go?
Or, that being a citizen she might not commit any lewdness
Through want of means, is she commanded to be given to her next kinsman,


Yes indeed, to the next kinsman: but whence are we? or wherefore?

Enough.
Do not try a suit, they say, when a judgment is passed.

Should I not try? nay, I will not give over,
Till I have brought this matter to an end.

You play the fool.

Do but let me alone.

Lastly Demipho, we have nothing to do with you,

For marrying was past already.

Suppose him
To say all these things that I have now said;
Or else truly I will forbid him my house with this wife of his.

He is angry.

You your self will do better then so.


You unhappie wretch.

He is afraid of us, although he dissembleth it
All that he can.

You have made a good beginning.

But you must suffer
What is to be suffered; you should do as is meet for you to do,
That we may be friends betwixt our selves.

Should I crave


If you will agree with her, you shall have one
To delight your old age: consider your own age.

Let her delight you: have her to your self.

Assuage your anger.

Mind this.
There have been now words enough; unless you make haste
Phormio.

If you lay a hand on her, otherwise then is fitting for a freeborn woman,
I will bring a huge action against you, I have told you my mind, Demipho.
If there shall be any need, ho, you shall find me at home.

I understand you.

EN! unquam cuiquam contumeliosius
Audistis factam injuriam, quam est mihi?
Adeste, quaeso.

Iratus est.

Quin tu hoc ages?
Jam ego hunc agitabo. Proh Deum immortaliu^ fide^!
Phanium hanc sibi esse cognatam Demipho!
Hanc Demipho negat esse cognatam?

Negat.

Neque ejus patrem se site, qui fuerit?

Negat.

Ipsum esse opinor de quo agebam, sequimini.

Neque Stilphonem scire, qui fuerit?

Negat.


Negligitur ipsa; vide avaritia quid facit.

Si herum insimulabis malitiae, male audies.

O audaciam! etiamne ultro accusatum ad ^enit.

Nam iam adolescenti nihil est quod succenseam,

Pauper, cui in opere vita erat, ruri fere
Se continebat: ibi agrum de nostro parente
Colendum habebat: saepe interea mihi senex
Narrabat, se hunc negligere cognatum suum.


Videas te atque illum ut narras.

Abi hinc in malam crucem.
Nam ni ita eum existumassem, nunquam tam graves
Ob hanc inimicitias caperem in nostram familiam,
Quam is aspernatur nunc tam inliberaliter.



Dignum autem hoc illo est.

Ain' tandem, carcer?

Geta.

Bonorum extortor, legum contortor.

Geta.

Responde.

Quis homo est? ehem.

Tace.

Absenti tibi
Te indignas, seque dignas contumelias
Demipho.

Desine.
Adolescens, primum abs te hoc bona venia expeto,
Si tibi placere potis est, mihi ut respondeas.
Quem amicum tuum ais fuisse istum? explana mihi?


Proinde expiscare, quasi non nosses.

Nossem?

Ita.

Ergo me nego; tu qui ais redige in memoriam.

Eho tu sobrinum tuum non noras?

Enecas.
Dic nomen.

Nomen? maxume.

Quid nunc taces?



Hem, quid ais?

Geta,
Si memiuisti id quod olim dictum est, subjice. Hem,
Non dico, quasi non noris, tentatum advenis.

Egon' autem tento?

Stilpho.

Atque adeo quid mea?
Stilpho est.

Quem dixti?

Stilphonem, inquam, non noras


Quisquam isto nomine.

Itane? non te horum pudet?
At si talentum rem reliquisset december.

Dii tibi male faciant.

Primus esses memoriter
Progeniem vestram usque ab avo atque atavo proferens.


Cognata esset ea dicerem: itidem tu face.
Cedo, qui est cognata?

Heus noster recte; heus tu, cave.

Dilucide expedivi, quibus me oportuit
Judicibus; tum id si falsum fuerat, filius


Filium narras mihi?
Cujus de stultitia dici, ut dignum est, non potest.

At tu, qui sapiens es, magistratus adi:
Judicium de eadem causa reddant tibi.
Quandoquidem solus regnas, and soli licet
Hic de eadem causa bis judicium adipiscier.


Potius quam lites secter, aut quam te audiam,
Itidem ut cognata si sit, id quod lex jubet
Dotem dare, abduce hanc, minas quinque accipe.

Ha, ha, he, homo suavis!

Quid est? number iniquum postulo?


Itane tandem, quaeso, item meretricem ubi abusus sis illam,
Mercedem dare lex jubet ei, atque amittere;
An, ut ne quid civis turpe in se admitteret,
Propter egestatem, proximo jussa est, dari,


Ita proxumo quidem; at nos unde, aut quamobrem:

Ohe,
Actum, aiunt, ne agas.

Non agam? immo haud desinam,
Donec perfecero hoc.

Ineptis.

Sine modo.

Postremo tecum nihil rei nobis, Demipho, est,

Praeterierat jam ad ducendum aetas.

Omnia haec
Illum putato quae ego nunc dico dicere:
Aut quidem cum uxore hac ipsum prohibebo domo.

Iratus est.

Tute idem melius feceris.


Infelix.

Metuit hic nos tametsi sedulo
Diffimulat.

Been habent tibi principia.

Quin quod est
Ferendum feras: tuis dignum factis feceris,
Ut amici inter nos simus.

Egon' tuam expetam


Si concordabis cum illa, habebis quae tuam
Senectutem oblectet; respice aetatem tuam.

Te oblectet: tibi habe.

Minue vero iram.

Hoc age.
Satis jam verborum est: nisi tu properes mulierem
Phormio.

Si illam attigeris secus quam dignum est, liberam:
Dicam tibiimpingam grandem. Dixi, Demipho.
Si quid opus fuerit, heus domi me.

Intelligo.

WHat care and trouble has my son brought upon me?
Who has entangled me and himself by this marriage?
Neither does he come forth into my sight, that I may know at least,
What he can say concerning this matter, or what his mind is.


I go.

Ye see in what state this matter stands.
What should I do? tell me, Hegio.

I think Cratinus had best tell you,
If you think good.

Tell me, Cratinus.

Would you have me tell you?

Yes you.
I would have you do those things, which may be for your own good* this is

Whilst you was away, be restored to it is former estate,
And this you will obtain. I have spoken my mind.

Now speak you, Hegio.

I think he has truly spoken his mind: but thus it is,
So many men, so many minds: every one has his own way.

Can be revoked; and it is an uglie thing to go about it.

Speak, Crito.

I think it is to be deliberated more on.
It is a weighty matter.

Will you have any thing else with us?

Ye have done very well,
I am much more uncertain, then I was erewhile.

They say he is not


I must wait for my brother;
What advice he shall give me, I will follow it.
I will go ask for him at the port, until he come back.

But I seek Antipho, that he may know, what things are done here.
But behold I see him coming hither in good time.

QUanta me cura and sollicitudine affecit
Gnatus, qui me and se hisce impedivit nuptiis?
Neque mihi in conspectum prodit, ut saltem sciam,
Quid de hac re dicat, quidve sit sententia.


Eo.

Videtis quo in loco res haecsict.
Quid ago? dic, Hegio,

Ego Cratinum censeo,
Si tibi videtur.

Dic, Cratine.

Mean vis?

Te.
Ego quae in rem tuam sint, ea velim facias: mihi

Egit; restitui in integrum aequum ac bonum est.
Et id impetrabis. Dixi.

Dic nunc Hegio.

Ego sedulo hunc dixisse credo; verum ita est,
Quot homines* tot sententiae; suus cuique mos est.

Rescindi posse, and turpe inceptum est.

Dic Crito.

Ego amplius deliberandum censeo,
Res magna est.

Numquid nos vis?

Fecistis probe,
Incertior sum multo quam dudum.

Negant


Frater est expectandus mihi;
Is quod mihi dederit de hac reconsilium id exsequar.
Percontatum ibo ad portum, quoad sefe recipiat.

Atque Antiphonem quaeram, ut quae acta hic sint, sciat.
Sed eccum ipsum video in tempore huc se recipere.

Truly, Antipho, you are much to be discommended with that faint heart,
That you should thus go away hence, and commit your life to others to be
preserved
Did you think other men would better mind your business then your self?
For however other things were, you might surely have consulted for her, who is
now at your house

Which poor woman's hopes and riches do all depend upon you alone.

Truly, master, we blamed you here even now, in your absence, because you went
away

I was looking for you.

But we failed never the more for that reason.

Speak, I pray you, in what state do my matters and fortunes stand?


Nothing at all.

Is there any further hope?

I know not.

Alas.

But that Phaedria did not cease to labor for you.

He has no new thing.

Besides Phormio in this, as in other matters,
Showed himself a stout man.

What did he?

He confuted
Your father that was very angry with words.

O brave Phormio!



O my Geta, I love you all.

Thus the entrance is made, as I tell you: the matter is yet in quiet;
And your father will tarry for your uncle, until he come hither.

Why will he tarry for him?

As he said, he would do according to his advice in that which
Belongs this business.

Geta, How greatly am I afraid that my uncle

Or die according to his sentence.

Here is Phaedria for you.

Where?

Look where he is, he comes forth out of his own wrestling-school doors.

ENimvero, Antipho, multis modis, cum istoc animo vituperandus es,
Itane te hinc abiisse, and vitam tuam tutandam aliis dedisse?
Alios tuam rem credidisti, magis quam tete animadversuros?
Nam utut erant alia, illi certe, quae nunc tuae domi est, consuleres.

Cujus nunc miserae spes opesque sunt in te uno omnes sitae.

Equidem, here, nos jam dudum hic te absentem incusamus, qui abieris.

Teipsum quaerebam.

Sed ea causa nihilo magis defecimus.

Loquere, obsecro, quonam in loco sint res and fortunae meae?


Nihil etiam.

Ecquid sp^i porro est?

Nescio.

Ah.

Nisi Phaedria haud cessavit pro te eniti.

Nihil secit novi.

Tum Phormio itidem hac re, ut in aliis,
Strenuum hominem praebuit.

Quid is fecit?

Confutavit
Verbis admodum iratum patrem.

Eheu Phormio!



Mi Geta, omnes vos amo.

Sic habent principia sese, ut dico: adhuc tranquilla res est;
Mansurusque patruum est pater, dum huc adveniat.

Quid eum?

Ut aiebant, de ejus consilio sese velle facere quod ad hanc
Rem attinet.

Quantus metus est mihi, venire huc nunc
Geta! Nam per ejus una^, ut audio, aut vi^a^
Aut moria^, sententiam.

Phaedria tibi adest.

Ubinan^

Eccum, ab sua palestra exit for as.

DOrio, I pray you, hear me.

I do not hear you.

A little while.

But let me alone.

Hear what I will say.

But it irketh me now to hear the same things a thousand times.

But now I will say what you will willingly hear.

Speak, I hear you.

Cannot I entreat you to tarry this three days? whither go you now?



Alas I fear the bawd should devise some mischief to his overthrow.

I fear the same.

Do thou not believe me?

Guess.

But if I pawn my credit.

These are but tales.

You will say that you got well by that good turn.

These are but words.

Believe me, you will be glad when it is done: verily this is true.

These are but dreams.



You sing the same song.

You shall be my cousin, you my parent, you my friend.

Prate* on now.

That you should be of such a hard and inexorable a nature,
That you can neither be softened by pity, or prayers!

That you should be so inconsiderate and indiscreet, Phaedria,


He pitties him.

Alas, I am confuted with your words.

How like either party is to himself!

And that this evil should then befall me,
When Antipho was busied with some other care.

Aias, but what is that, Phaedria?

O most fortunate Antipho!

What I?

Who have that at home, which you love.


Have I at home? nay, as they say, I hold a wolf by the ears,
For neither can I devise, how to send her away, nor do I know how to keep her.

My case is the very same about this man.

Soft, be not too cheap a bawd.
Has he done any thing for you?

What he? that which a most discourteous fellow would do.
Pamphila.

What has he sold her?

Say, you, he has sold her?

He has sold her.

What an unworthie act was it, to sell a maid that was bought with his own
money

I cannot entreat him that he would tarry, and alter his promise with the man,
This three days, whilst I get the money which is promised by my friends.
If I give it you not then, do not stay for me one hour longer.



That which he entreats, Dorio, is not long: let him over-intreat you.
He shall doubly requite you this, which you shall well deserve.

These are but words.

Will you suffer Pamphila to be deprived of this city?
And besides can you be able to endure their love to be pulled asunder?

Neither can I nor you suffer it.

God reward you according to your deserts.

Promising, and bringing nothing, lamenting; now on the other side,
I have found one that will give all things, and not weep; give place to your
betters

In very truth, if I well remember, there was heretofore a day,
On which being the set day you should have given him the money.

It was so.

Do I deny that?



No, but this day is come before it.

Are you not ashamed
Of your lightness?

No, so it be for my profit.

You dughillraskal.

Dorio,
Ought you to do so I pray you?

This is my quality, if you please, make use of me.

Do you so deceive this man?

Nay rather, Antip^o, this man deceives me.
For he knew I was such a one. I thought him to be otherwise;

But however these things are, yet this will I do; to morrow morning the
soldier sai
He would give me the money; if you Phaedria, will bring it me the first,
I will make use of my own law, that he shall be the better chapman that pays
me the first. Farewell

DOrio, audi, obsecro.

Non audio.

Patumper.

Quin omit n e.

Audi quid dicam.

Atenim taedet jam audire eadem millies.

At nunc dicam quod lubenter audias.

Loquere, audio.

Nequeo orare, ut maneas triduum hoc* quo nunc abis?



Hei metuo lenonem, ne aliquid suo suat capiti.

Idem metuo.

Non mihi credis?

Hariolare.

Sin fidem do.

Fabulae.

Foeneratum istuc beneficium pulchre tibi dices.

Logi.

Creed mihi, gaudebis facto: verum hercle hoc est.

Somnia.



Cantilenam eandem canis.

Tu mihi cognatus, tu mihi parens, tu amicus.

Garri modo.

Adeon' ingenio te esse duro atque inexorabili
Ut neque misericordia neque precibus molliri queas*

Adeon' te esse incogitantem atque impudentem, Phaedria,


Miseritum est.

Hei, verbis vincor.

Quam uterque est similis sui*

Neque Antipho alia cum occupatus esset follicitudine,
Tum hoc mihi esse objectum malum.

Ah, quid istuc autem est, Phaedria?

O fortunatissime Antipho!

Egone?

Cui, quod amas, domi est.


Mihin' domi est? immo, quod aiunt, auribus teneo lupum.
Nam neque quomodo amittam invenio, neque uti retineam scio.

Ipsum istuc mihi in hoc est.

Eja, ne parum leno sies.
Numquid hic confecit?

Hiccine? quod homo inhumanissimus,


Quid? vendidit?

A^n', vendi it?

Vendidit.

Quod indignum facinus, ancill m^ emptam suo.

Neque exorare, ut maneat, and cum illo ut mutet fidem,
Triduum hoc, dum id quod est promissum ab amicis argentum aufero;
Si non tum dedero, unam praeterea horam ne opertus s^es.



Haud longum est id quod orat, Dorio: exoret, sine.
Idem hoc, tibi, quod been promericus fueris, conduplicabit.

Verba istaec sunt.

Pamphulamne hac urbe privati sines?
Tum praeterea horum amorem distrahi poterin' pati?

Neque ego, neque tu.

Dii tibi id quod dignum duint.


Pollicitantem, nihil serentem, flentem; nunc contra, omnia
Repperi qui det, neque lachrymet; da locum melioribus.

Certe hercle, ego si satis memini, tibi est olim dies
Quam ad dares huic, praestitutam.

Factum.

Number ego istuc nego?



Non, verum haec ei antecessit.

Non pudet
Vanitatis?

Minime, dum ob rem.

Sterquilinium.

Dorio,
Itane tandem facere oportet?

Sic sum, si placet, utere.

Siccine hunc decipis?

Immo enimvero, Antipho, hic me decipit;
Nam hic me hujusmodi esse sciebat. Ego hunc esse aliter credidi;

Sed ut haec sunt, tamen hoc faciam: cras mane argentum mihi
Miles dare se dixit: si mihi prior tu attuleris, Phaedria,
Mea lege utar, ut potior sit qui prior ad dandum est. Vale.

WHat should I do? whence should I poor man get money for him on such a sudd^in,
Who have less then nothing? But if he could now have tarried
This three days, it was promised me.

Should we suffer this man, Geta,
To become miserable, who of late, as you told me, helped me kindly?


I know indeed this is but reasonable.

Go to then, you alone are able to save him.

What should I do?

You must get the money.

I desire that; but whence, teach me.

My father is hereby.

I know that, but what them?

Ah, a word is enough to a wiseman.

Is it so?

Yes. Truly you persuade me finely: and do you go hence too?

Except you also now command me to seek my death in doing mischief for this
man's sake

He speaks truth.

What? am I, Geta, a stranger to you?

do not think it,
But is it a small matter, that the old man is now angry with us all,
Except we provoke him further, that there may be no place left for entreaty?


Therefore whilst you may, and whilst I am here, speak with me, Antipho,
Look upon me.

Why so? or what are you about to do? tell me.

Into what part of the earth soever she shall be carried hence, I am resolved
to follow her, or to die

God prosper what you are to do, yet go fair and softly.

See,


If I can, I will, what?

Devise I pray you,
Lest he should devise any thing more or less, which may afterward grieve
us, O Geta

I am devising;
He is well enough, as I suppose, but indeed I fear the mischief.

Do not fear.
We will bear the good and bad with you.

How much have you need of?
Speak.

But thirty pounds.

Thirty! whoo! Phaedria, she it very dear.



Well, well, I will get them and give you them.

Oh,
Merry fellow.

Get you away hence.

I have now need.

You shall carry
The money by and by; but I have need of Phormio to help in this matter.

He is at hand, be very bold to lay any burden on him, and he will bear it;
he is the only ma
That is a friend.

Let us go to him then quickly.

Go, bid him be ready at home.



Nothing, but go your way home,
And comfort that poor woman, whom I know to be within astonished with fear.
Do you loiter?

There is nothing that I will do so willingly.

What way will you do that?

I will tell you by the way; only get you aside hence.

QUid faciam? unde ego tam subito huic argentum inveniam, miser,
Cui ^us nihil est? Quod hic si potuisset nunc ex^ier
Triduum hoc, promissum fuerat.

Itane hunc patiemur, Geta,
Fieri miserum, qui me dudum, ut dixti, adjuverit comiter?


Scio equidem hoc esse aequum.

Age ergo, solus servare hunc potes.

Quid faciam?

Invenias argentum.

Cupio; sed id unde, edoce.

Pater adest hic.

Scio; sed quid tum?

Ah. Dictum fapienti sat est.

Itane?

Ita.

Sane hercle, pulcre suades: etiam tu hinc abis?

Ni etiam nunc me hujus causa quaerere in malo jubeas crucem?

Verum hic dicit.

Quid? ego vobis, Geta, alienus sum?

Haud puto.
Sed parumne est, quod omnibus nunc nobis succenseat senex,
Ni instigemus etiam ut nullus locus relinquatur preci?


Dum igitur licet, dumque adsum, loquimini mecum, Antipbo.
Contemplamini me.

Quamobrem? aut quidnam es facturus? cedo.

Quoquo hinc asportabitur terrarum, certum est persequi illam aut perire.

Dii been vortant quod agas: pederentim tan en.

Vide


Si possum faciam; quid?

Quaere, obsecro,
Ne quid plus minusve faxit, quod nos post pigeat, O Geta.

Quaero.
Salvus est, ut opinor: verum enim metuo malum.

Noli metuere:
Una tecum bona malaque tolerabimus.

Quantu^ opus est tibi?
Loquere.

Solae triginta minae.

Triginta (...) hui perchara est, Phaedria*



Age, age: inventas reddam.

Oh,
Lepidum caput.

Aufer te hinc.

Jam opus est.

Jam jam
Feres; sed opus est mihi Phormionem ad hanc rem adjutorem dari.

Praesto est, audacissime quidvis oneris impone and feret; solus est homo
Amicus.

Eamus ergo ad eum ocyus.

Abi, dic praesto ut sit domi.



Nihil, verum abi domum,
Et illam miseram, quam ego nunc intus scio esse exanimatam metu,
Consolare. Cessas?

Nihil est aeque quod faciam lubens.

Qua via istuc facies?

Dicam in itinere: modo te hinc amove.

WHat? For what reason did you go hence to Lemnus, Chremes?
Have you brought your daughter with you?

No.

Why have you not done so?

After her mother saw that I tarried here somewhat too long,
And withal that the maids age did not tarry for

With her whole family.

Why then I pray you,
Did you tarry there so long, after you had heard that?

In truth sickness held me.

Whence, or what was it?

Do you ask?
Old age it self is a disease: but I heard by the seaman


Have you heard, Chremes, what has happened to my son?

Which deed verily makes me uncertain what to resolve;
For if I should make this profer to any f^rainer,
I must tell him in order, how, and whence she is my daughter.

If that stranger be willing to have me his kinsman,
He will hold his tongue* so long as we are f^iends betwixt our selves;
But if he slight me, he shall know more then is requisite to be known.
And I am afraid lest my wife should know this some way or other,

And go forth of my house: for I alone am my own of all that I have.

I know it is so, and therefore that matter is a trouble to me.
Neither will I cease any time to try all ways,
Until I have effected for you that which I have promised.

QUid? qua profectus causa hinc es Lemmum, Chremes?
Adduxtin' tecum filiam?

Non.

Quid ita non?

Postquam vidit me ejus matter esse hic diutius,
Simul autem non manebat aetas virginis


Quid illic tamdiu Quaeso igitur commorabare, ubi id audiveras?

Pol me detinuit morbus.

Unde, aut qui?

Rogas?
Senectus ipsa morbus est; sed venisse eas


Quid gnato obtigerit audistin' Chreme?

Quod quidem me factum consilii incertum facit;
Nam hanc conditionem si cui tulero extrario,
Quo pacto aut unde mihi sic, dicendum ordine est.


Sciebam, ille sime alienus affinem volet,
Tacebit, dum intercedit familiaritas;
Sin spreverit me, plus quam opus est scito, sciet.
Vereorque ne uxor aliqua hoc resciscat mea.

Idrestat; nam ego meorum solus sum meus.

Scio ita esse, and ideo istaec res mihi sollicitudini est,
Neque defetiscar unquam ego experitier
Donec tibi id quod pollicitus sum effecero.

I Never knew a man more crafty
Then Phormio: I come to the man to tell him
We had need of money, and how that might be done,
I had scarce spoken the half, but he understood me.

He thanked God that a time was offered him,
Wherein he might show himself to be no less
A friend to Phaedria, then he was to Antipho. I bade the man
To tarry for me at the market, and said, I would bring the old man thither.
Phaedria's
Father comes: but why did I fear, a beast that I am?
Was it because two are offered me, whom I may deceive in stead of one?
I think it more profitable to make use of a double hope.
I will ask of him of whom I resolved from the beginning: if he give, it is
sufficient
If nothing can be done from him, then I will set upon this stranger.

EGo hominem callidiorum vidi neminem
Quam Phormionem; venio ad hominem ut dicerem
Argento opus esse, and id quo pacto fieret,
Vixdum dimidium dixeram, intellexerat.
Gaudebat: me laudabat: quaerebat senem:
Diis gratias agebat, tempus sibi dari,
Ubi Phaedriae se ostenderit nihilominus
Amicum esse, quam Antiphoni. Hominem ad forum
Jussi operiri, eo me esse adducturum senem.
Sed eccum ipsum: quis est ulterior? atat, Phaedriae
Pater venit: sed quid pertimui autem bellua?
An quia quos fallam pro uno duo sunt mihi dati?
Commodius esse duco duplici spe utier.
Petam hinc unde a primo institui: si is dat, sat est.
Si ab hoc nihil fiet, tum hunc adoriar hospitem.

I Tarry to see how quickly Geta. returns hither.
But I see my uncle standing with my father: woe is me,
How I am afraid whither his coming may drive my father.

I will go to these men, O our Chremes.

God save you, Geta.



I believe.

What is done?

Many things are new to me at my coming home, as it falls out, here are a
great many new matters

Yes, Have you heard concerning Antipho what was done?

I have heard all.

Had you jtold him? it is an unworthy trick, Chremes,
To be thus cosened.

I talked convenientlie about it with my brother.


Have found a remedy for this matter, as I suppose.

What Geta?
What remedy?

As I departed from you, Phormio. by chance
Met me.

What Phormio?

He who packed this woman upon us.

I know him.

I thought good to try his mind,
Phormio, quoth I
That these things be composed betwixt you
With good will, rather then with ill will?
My master is a free-hearted man, and one that avoids suites in law:
For truly all the rest of our friends erewhile


What does this fellow begin, or what will he come to to day?

Will you say
That he shall be punished according to law, if he cast her out?
That is certainly known already: soft, you shall find work enough,
If you begin with the man, he has such a fine deliverie.

The matter in question is not concerning his life, but his money.
After I perceived the fellow was softened with these words,
We are now here alone, say I; he, tell me what would you have
To be given you in hand, that my master may let this suite fall,
That she may go away hence, and that you may not be troublesome.

Does God prosper him sufficiently?

For I know very well,
If you will but speak any piece of right and reason,
He is so good a man, you will not make three words
Today betwixt you.

Who commanded you to say those words?


Thither whither we desire.

I am undone.

Go on to tell out your tale.

But at first the fellow played the madman.

Tell me, what does he demand?

What? too much, as much as he listed.

Tell me.

If any body would give it,
A great talent (i. e. fourscore and three pounds.)

Yea indeed a ha^ter, how he is ashamed of nothing:


Not to have begot another; there one found, that can desire a portion.
That I may be short, and let go his fooleries,
This in fine was his last speech;
(...), quoth he, now from the beginning desired to marry

For I considered of her discommoditie,
That a poor woman should be given to a rich man to be made a drudge:
But I stood in need (that I may tell you the plain story)
Of one that might bring me somewhat, whereby I might pay
Demipho will just now give me as much
As I am to receive of her, which is espoused to me,
I should desire no woman to be given me to wife, sooner then her.

I am uncertain whether I should say this fellow does these things
Through folly, or mischievousness, witting or unadvised.



His ground, he says, is mortgaged
For ten pounds.

Go to, go to, let him marry her now, I will give it him.

His little house is mortgaged for other ten.

Hui!
It is too much.

Do not cry out, fetch these ten from me.

He must buy a little maid for his wife, besides he stand^ in need

Suppose indeed for these things (says he) ten pounds.

Let him now likewise rather enter six hundred actions against me,
I will give him never a penni^; that the naughty knave should also mock me?

I pray you be content, I will give it: do but you make your son


Woe is me, Geta,
You have quite undone me with your fallacies.

She is packt out for my sake,
It is but reason that I should lose this.

Let me know from you, says he,
As soon as you can, if they will give me her;
That I may let this go, lest I be held in uncertainties.


Let him take his money by and by; let him signify to them the divorcement,
Let him marry her.

Which thing indeed may it never prosper with him.

I have now very fitly brought money with me,
The rent, which my wives farms at Lemnos yield me;


EXspecto quam mox recipiat sese huc Geta.
Sed patruum video cum patre astantem: hei mihi,
Quam timeo adventus hujus quo impellat patrem.

A dibo hosce. O noster Chremes.

Salve, Geta.



Credo.

Quid agitur?

Multa advenienti, ut fit, nova hic compluria.

Ita. de Antiphone audisti quae facta?

Omnia.

Tun' dixeras huic? sacinus indignum, Chreme,
Sic circumiri.

Id cum hoc agebam commodum.


Inveni ut opinor remedium huic rei.

Quid Geta?
Quod remedium?

Ut abii abs te, fit mihi forte obviam
Phormio.

Qui Phormio?

Is qui istam.

Scio.

Visum est mihi, ut ejus tentarem sententiam.
Phormio,
Vides, inter vos haec potius cum bona
Ut componantur gratia, quam cum ma^a?
Herus liberalis est, and fugitans litium;
Nam caeteri quidem hercle amici omnes modo


Quid hic caeptat, aut quo evadet hodie?

An legibus
Daturum poenas dices, si illam ejecerit?
Jam id exploratum est; eja, sudabis satis,
Si cum illo inceptas homine, ea eloquentia est.

Non capitis ejus res agitur, sed pecuniae.
Postquam hominem his verbis sentio mollirier,
Soli sumus nunc, inquam, hic; eho, dic quid velis
Dari tibi in manum, ut herus his desistat litibus;
(...). Haec hinc facessat, tu molestus n^ sies.

Satin' illi Dii sunt propitii?

Nam sat scio,
Situ aliquam partem aequi bonique dixeris,
Ut est ille bonus vir, tria non commutabitis
Verba hodie inter vos.

Quis te isthaec jussit loqui;


Eo quo nos volumus.

Occidi.

Perge cloqui.

At primo homo insanibat.

Cedo, quid postulat?

Quid; nimium, quantum libuit.

Dic.

Si quis daret,
Talentum magnum.

Immo malum hercle, ut nihil pudet.


Non suscepisse; inventa est, quae dotem petat.
Ut ad pauca redeam, ac omittam illius ineptias;
Haec denique ejus fuit postrema oration;
Ego, inquit, jam a principio amici filiam

Nam mihi veniebat in mentem ejus incommodum,
In servitutem pauperem ad ditem dari:
Sed mihi opus erat, ut aperte tibi nune fabuler,
Aliquantulum quae afferret, qui dissolverem
Demipho
Dare quantum ab hac accipio, quae sponsa est mihi,
Nullam mihi malim, quam istanc uxorem dari.

Utrum stultitia facere ego hunc an malitia
Dicam, scientem an imprudentem, incertus sum.



Ager oppositus est pignori ob
December minas, inquit.

Age, age, jam ducat, dabo.

Aediculae item sunt ob december alias.

Hui,
Nimium est.

Ne clama, petisto hasce a me december.

Uxori emunda ancillula est, tum autem pluscula

^is rebus pone sane december, inquit, minas.

Sexcentas perinde potius scribi^o mihi jam dicas:
Nihil do; impuratus me ille ut etiam irrideat?

Quaeso, ego dabo, quiesce: tu modo filius


H^ mihi, Geta,
Occidisti me tuis fallaciis:

Mea causa ejicitur.
Me hoc est aequum amittere.

Quantum potes,
Me certiorem, inquit, face, si illam dant;
Hanc ut mittam, ne incertus siem:


Jam accipiat: illis repudium r^nunciet.
Hanc ducat.

Quae quidem illi res vortat male.

Opportune adeo nunc argentum mecum attuli;
Fructum, quem Lemni uxoris reddunt praedia:


GEta.

How now?

What have you done?

I have wiped the old men of the money.

Is that sufficient?

Truly I know not, thus much I was bidden to do.

Oh you whipt-rascal; you answer me another thing then I ask you.

What then do you say?

What should I say? by your means

I wish some heavy judgment may light on you
For example to others: Ho, if you would any thing,
Which you would have well done, you may commit it to this fellow,
Who may bring you out of a calm place to dash against a rock.

Or to mention a wife? my father is put in hope
That she may be thrust out. Tell me now besides if Phormio
Shall receive the portion, he must marry his wife home to him.
What shall be done?

But he shall not marry her.

I know it. But,

He will rather go to the goal.

There is nothing, Antipho,
But it may be corrupted by wrong telling.
You pick out that which is good, and speak that which is naught.
Hear now on the other side; if he receive the money,

A little space at last will indeed be granted
In preparing for the wedding to invite folks, and to sacrifice:
In the mean time friends will give the money which they promised,
And he shall restore it to them.

Wherefore? or what shall he say?

Do you ask?

A strange black dog came into the house,
A snake fell from the tyles through the square place where the rain falls in.
A hen crew, the wizzard forespake it;
The deviner forbad to begin any ne^ business

These things shall be done, I warrant you.
Your father comes forth, go your way, tell Phaedria that I have money for him.

GEta.

Hem.

Quid egisti?

Emunxi argento senes.

Satin' est id?

Nescio hercle; tantum jussus sum.

Eho verbero, aliud mihi respondes ac rogo.

Quid ergo narras?

Quid ego narrem? operatua

Utte quidem omnes Dii, Deaeque, superi, inferi,
Malis exemplis perduint: Hem si quid velis
Huic mandes, quod quidem recte curatum velis,
Qui te ad scopusum e tranquillo inferat.

Aut nominare uxorem? injecta est spes patri
Posse illam extrudi: cedo, nunc porro Phormio
Dotem si accipiet, uxor ducenda est domum.
Quid fiet?

Non enim ducer.

No^i. Caeterum

In nervum potius ibit.

Nihil est, Antipho,
Quin male narrando possit depravarier:
Tu id quod boni est excerpis: dicis quod mali est.
Audi nunc contra jam; si argentum acceperit,

Spatium quidem tandem apparandis nuptiis
Vocandi, sacrificandi, dabitur paululum.
Interea amici quod polliciti sunt argentum dabunt,
Idille istis reddet,

Quamobrem? aut quid dicet?

Rogitas?

Introiit in aedes ater alienus canis,
Anguis per impluvium decidit de tegulis,
Gallina cecinit, interdixit hariolus,
Haruspex vetuit ante brumam aliquid novi

Haec fient.

Ut modo fiant.

Fient, me vide.
Pater exit, abi, dic, esse argentum, Phaedriae.

BE quiet, I say, I will have a care they do not cozen us;
I will never let this go from me rashly, but I will take witnesses to me,
I will set down a memorandum to whom I give, and wherefore I give.

How wary he is, where there is no need!

But he has need to do so; but make haste, whilst he is in the same mind.


You have thought as the matter is.

Bring me to him then.

I make no delay.

When you have done this,
Step over to my wife, that she may speak with her, before she go hence;
Let her tell her that we will give her in marriage to Phormio, that she be not
angry
And that he (...) a more fit match, who may be more familiar with her.

As he desired.

What does this concern you, with a mischief!

Much, Demipho.

Is it not enough for you to have done your duty, if fame approve it not?

I would have this done also with her good will, lest she should report that
she was cast out

I my self can do that.

A woman will agree better with a woman.



I am thinking where I may find these women.

QUietus esto, inquam: ego curabo ne quid verborum duit.
Hoc temere nunquam amittam ego a me, quin mihi testes adhibeam,
Cui them, and quamobrom them comemorabo.

Ut cautus est, ubi nihil est opus!

Atqui ita opus est facto; at matura, dum libido eadem haec manet.


Rem ipsam putasti.

Duc me ad eum ergo.

Non moror.

Ubi hoc egeris,
Transito ad uxorem meam, ut conveniat hanc prius quam hinc abeat.
Dicat eam nos dare Phormioni nuptum: ne succenseat,
Et magis esse illum idoneum, qui ipsi sit familiarior.

Datum esse dotis.

Quid tua, malum, id resert?

Magni Demipho.

Non sat tuum officium fecisse, si non id ^ama approbat?

Volo ipsius quoque voluntate hoc fieri, ne se ejectum praedicet.

Idem ego istuc facere possum.

Mulier mulieti magis congruet.



Ubi ego illas repperire possim, cogito.

WHat should I do? whom shall I find to be my friend poor woman, or to whom
Shall I impart these purposes? or of whom should I desire help?
For I am afraid lest my mistress through my persuasion should be unworthilie
wronged
I h^a^ the young man's father takes these things that are done so pas^ ^atelie.



Which poverty forced me to do, when I know this was an uncertain
Marriage; that I might take that course, that our life might be preserved in
the mean time

Verily, except I be mistaken, or my eyes fail me,
I see my daughters nurse.

Neither is he to be traced out.

What should I do?



Had I best go to her or tarry, till I better know what she says?

But if I could but now find him, there would be nothing that I should fear.

It is just she,
I will speak with her.

Who speaks here?

Sophrona.

And does he name my name too?

Look back to me.

O strange, is this Stilpho?

No.

Do you say no?

Go aside hence from the door a little this way I pray you, Sophrona.


What I pray you, are not you he,
Whom you have always used to say you were?

Whisht.

What, are you afraid of this door?

I have a cursed wife pent up; but concerning that name,
I have told you wrong heretofore to that end, left you peradventure being
indiscree
Should blab it out, and my wife also should come to know it one way or other.



Come on, tell me, what have you to do with this family whence you come? or
where ar
Those women?

Woe is me.

Ha, what is the matter? are they living?

Your daughter is alive:
But death has seized upon the mother for very grief.

This is ill done.

And I who was a forlorn old woman, being in want, and unknown,

Of this house.

To Antipho?

Ah, to himself.

What?
Has be two wives?

Soft, I pray you, he has indeed this one alone.

What is that other woman, which is said to be his kinswoman?

This is then she.

What say you?

It was done on purpose, how he being in love might have her


O strange! how often do these things fall out by chance unadvisedlie,
Which one dare not wish! at my coming I have found my daughter
Placed with him that I desired, and as I desired.
That which we both endeavored with a great deal of pains, that it might be
done
This woman alone has effected without any great care of ours.


And they say he takes it very impatiently.

There is no danger:
But for God's sake and man's, take heed that no body kno^w this is my
daughter

No body shall know it from me.

Follow me, you shall hear the rest within.

QUid agam? quem mihi amicum inveniam misera? aut cui

Quicum volebam, atque ut volebam collocatam filiam.
Quod nos ambo, opere maxumo, dabamus operam, ut fieret,
Sine nostra cur? maxima sua cura haec sola fecit.


Eumque animo iniquo oppido serre aiunt.

Nihil per^^li est.
Sed per Deos atque homines, meam esse hanc, cave res^iscat quisquam.

Nemo ex me scibit.

Sequere me; caetera intus audies.

THrough our default we cause, that it is better to be evil,
Whilst we strive too much that we may be reputed good and kind.

One must so ^lie, as they say, that he run not beyond his cottage.

Was not that enough,
To take wrong at his hands, but we must offer him money of cur own accord?


Very clearlie.

They are now rewarded, that make right things wrong.

Very truly.

How foolishlie now have we handled the matter with him:

Only I wish we could come off with this device, that he may marry her.

What is there any doubt of that?

Truly I know not, such afellow as he is, how he may alter his mind.



I hope not, but if by chance he do, I say.

I will do, as my brother advised, that I may bring his wife hither,
That she may speak with her. O you Geta, go your way, tell her beforehand
that she is coming

We have got money for Phaedria; not a word of the chiding.
We have provided that she may not go hence for the present; and what further?

Geta; the mischief which was present, is but prolonged to another day; your
stripes increase
Unless you look to it beforehand. Now will I go home hence, and instruct
Phanium
That she may not any whit be afraid of Phormio, or his discourse.

NOstrapte culpa facimus, ut malos expediat esse,
D^m nimium dici no^ bonos studemus and benignes.

Ita fugias ne praeter ca^ quod aiunt.

Nonne id saterat,
Accipere ab illo injuriam? etiam argentum est ultro objectum,


Planissime.

His nunc praemium est, qui recta praya faciunt.

Verissime.

Ut stultissime equidem illi rem gesserimus.

Modo ut hoc consilio possit discedi, ut istam ducat.

Etiamne id dubium est?

Haud scio hercle, ut homo est, an mutet animum.



Nescio, verum si forte, dico.

Ita faciam ut frater censuit, ut uxorem huc ejus adducam,
Cum ista ut loquatur. O tu Geta, abi: praenuntia hanc venturam.

Argentum inventum est Phaedriae: de jurgio siletur:
Provisum est ne in praesentia haec hinc abeat; quid vero porro?

Geta; praesens quod fuerat malum, in diem abiit: plagae crescunt,
Nisi prospicis. Nunc hinc domum ibo, ac Phanium edocebo,
Ne quid vereatur Phormionem, aut ejus orationem.

COme do (...) you are used to do, Nausistrata, see that she be friends with us;
That she may do that which must be done, of her own good will.

I will do it.

Now help me with your pains, like as heretofore you helped me with the estate.

I am willing to do it, and indeed I am able to do less through my husband's
fault, then is becoming me



Because indeed he negligently looks after the means
Which my father got honestly. For he constantly got two talents
Of silver by the farms. Ha, how one man exceeds another!

Two talents, I pray you?

And when things were much cheaper, yet two talents.

Whoo!

What do these seem a wonder to you?

Yes.

I wish I had been born a man,


I know very well.

Which way?

Forbear I pray you,
That you may be able to talk with her; lest the young-woman weary you quite
out

I will do as you bid me, but I see my husband come from your house.

Ho Demipho,
Is the money given him already?

I took order presently.

I would it had not been given. Alas, I see my wife; I had almost said more
then was enough

Chtemes?

Now all is well.

What say you? have you spoken with her,
Why we bring this woman?

I have dispatched.

What says she at last?

She cannot be got away.

Why can she not?

Because they both love one another dearly.

What does that concern us?

Very much.
Besides these things, I have found her to be our kinswoman.

What? do you do^t?

No.


Are you
Well in your wits?

Soft, I pray you, take heed you do nothing against our kinswoman.

She is not our kinswoman.

Do not deny it. Her father is called by another name, herein you have been
mistaken

Did not she
Know her father?

She knew him.

Why did she call him by another name?

You will never
Yield to me to day, neither do you understand.

If you tell me nothing.



I wonder what this is.

Truly I know not.

Would you fain know? verily, there is no body nearer akin to her
Then I am and you.

O strange! let all us go together to her,
I will know this off, or on.

Ah, ah.

What is the matter?

That I should have so little belief with you?

Would you have me believe this?
Will you have that to be sufficiently enquired by me? well, be it so: what,
she our friend'
Daughter, what will become of it?

Well.

Should (...) send this woman away?

What else?

Must that other tarry?

Yes.

You may go, Nausistrata.

I think indeed it is more convenient for all parties that she tarry,
Then to do as you began. For she seemed to me of a very good disposition,
when I saw her

What business is here?

Has he shut the doors already?

Already.

O strange! we rose (...) our right side.


Ha, how could that be?

This place is not safe enough for me to tell you in.

But go your way in.

Ho. Let not our sonues know this; I am unwilling they should.

AGedum, ut soles, Nausistrata; fac illa ut placetur nobis;
Ut sua voluntate id, quod est faciendum, faciat.

Faciam.

Pariter nunc opera me adjuves, ac dudum re opitulata es.

Factum volo, ac pol minus queo viri culpa, quam me dignum est.



Quia pol mei patris been parta indiligenter
Tutatur. Nam ex praediis talenta argenti bina
Statim capiebat. Hem, vir viro quid praestat?

Bina, quaeso?

Ac rebus vilioribus multo, tamen duo talenta.

Hui!

Quid haec videntur?

Scilicet.

Virum me na^ vellem,


Certo scio.

Quo pacto?

Parce sodes,
Ut possis cum illa: ne te adolescens mulier aff^^iget.

Faciam ut jubes, sedmeum virum abs te exire video.

Ehem Demipho,
Jam illi datum est argentum?

Curavi illico.

Nollem datum. H^^, video uxorem; pene plus quam sat erat.

Chreme?

Jam recte.

Quid tu? ecquid loquutus
Cum ista ^s, quamobrem hanc ducimus?

Transegi.

Quid ait tandem?

Abduci non potest.

Quid non potest?

Quia uterque utrique est cordi.

Quid istuc nostra?

Magni.
Praeter haec, cognatam comperi esse nobis.

Quid? deliras?

Non.


Satin'
Sanus es?

Au, obsecro, cave in cognatam pecces.

Non est.

Ne nega. Patris nomen aliud dictum est, hoc tu ^rrasti.

Non norat
Patrem?

Norat.

Cur aliud dixit?

Nunquamne hodie
Concedes mihi, neque intelligis.

Si tu nihil narres.



Miror quid est hoc.

Equidem hercle nescio.

Vin' scire? at, ita me servet Jupiter, ut proprior illi, quam ego sum
Ac ^u, nemo est.

Dii vostra^ fide^! ^amus ad ipsa^ una omnes no^,
Aut scire, aut nescire hoc volo.

Aha.

Quid est?

Itane parum mihi fidem esse apud te?

Vis me hoc credere?
Vin' satis quaesitum mihi istuc esse? age, fiat: quid, illa filia
Amici nostri, quid futurum est?

Recte.

Hanc igitur mittimus?

Quid^i?

Illa maneat?

Sic.

Ireigitur tibi licet, Nausistrata.

Sic pol commodius esse in omnes arbitror, quam ut coeperas, manner
Hanc. Nam perliberalis visa est, cum vidi, mihi.

Quid istuc negotii est?

Jamne operuit ostium?

Jam.

O Jupiter! Dii nos recipient.


Hem, quo pacto
Id potuit?

Non satis tutus est ad narrandum hic locus.

At tu intro abi.

Heus. Ne filii quidem nostri hoc resciscunt: nolo.

IAm glad, howsoever my own matters go, that my brother has sped well.
What a fine thing it is to furnish the mind with such desires,
As, when adversity comes, you may remedy them a little!
As soon as he got money, he rid himself of his care.
(...) I cau by no means wind my self out of these turmo^s.
But, if this be concealed, I am in fear; if it be discovered, I am disgraced.
Neither would I betake my self home now, unless hope was showed me
Of having her. But where can I find Geta,
That I may ask him what time he will appoint me to meet with my father?

LAetus sum, ut ut ^eae res sese habent, sratri obtigisse quod vult.
Quam scitu^ est, ejusmodi parare in animo cupiditates,
Quas cum res adversae sient, paulo mederi possis!
Hit simul argentum repperit, cura se expedivit.

Quin, si hoc celetur, in metu; sin patefit, in ptobro siem.
Neque me domum nunc reciperem, ni mihi esset spes ostensa
Hujusce habendae. Sed ubinam Getam invenire possum,
Ut rogem quod tempus conveniendi patris capere me jubeat?

II have received the money; I have delivered it to the bawd, I have brought
away the woman
I have taken order that Phaedria may enjoy her as his own: for she is set free.
Now there is yet one thing behind for me, which I must also dispatch; that I
may ge
Leisure of the old men to drink: for I will spend these few days.

Phormio; what say you?

What?

What does Phaedria now mean to do?
How does he say he will have his fill of love?

He will now on the other side act your part.

What?

To outrun his father.
He entreated you that you would plead his cause again, and speak for him,
For he is going to tipple at my house: I will tell the old men,
Sunium to the Mart, to buy a little maid, which Geta spoke of a while ago,
Lest when they see me not here, they may think I am spending their money.
But your door creek't.

See who comes forth.

It is Geta.

ARgentum accepi; tradidi lenoni; abduxi mulierem;
Curavi propria ea Phaedria ut potiretur; nam emissa est manu.
Nune una res restat mihi, quae est etiam conficiunda; otium
A senibus ad potandum ut habea^: nam aliquot hos consuma^ dies.

Phormio est; quid ais?

Quid?

Quidnam nunc facturus est Phaedria?
Quo pacto satietatem amoris ait se velle sumere?

Vicissim parts tuas acturus est.

Quas?

Ut fugitet patrem.
Te suam rogavit rursum ut ageres causam, ut pro se diceres,
Nam potaturus est apud me: ego me ire senibus Sunium
Geta,
Ne, cum hic non videant me, conficere credant argentum suum.
Sed ostium concrepuit abs te.

Vide quis egrediatur.

Geta est.

O Fortune! O luckie fortune! with how great commodities
On what sudden have you loded this day to my master Ansipho through your
assistance

What does he mean?

And you disburdened us his friends of our fear.
But do I loiter with my self, who do not load his shoulder with my cloak,


Do you understand what he says?

Do you?

Not at all.

No more do I.

I will go onward hence to the bawd's; there they are now.

Ho Geta.

Lo there is for you. Is it any wonder or strange thing for you
To be called back again, when you have begun the race?

Geta.



Do you not tarry?

You shall be beaten: he is some little Beadle of the ward that calls me.

That shall be done to you by and by, except you stay, you whipped raskal.

This must be some body that is more acquainted with me; he threatens harm.
But is it he whom I am seeking or no? it is he.

Go talk with him presently.

What is the matter?


For without controversy, you are the only happy man, Antipho.

I wish I were: but I would have it told me, why I should believe it is so.

Is it not enough, if I make you besmeared with joy?

You quite kill me.

But do you away with these promises, and tell me what you bring.

Oh,
Phormio?

I was here. But do you forbear?

Hearken, ha,
As soon as I had given you the money even now at the market: we went home.
Straightway. In the mean time my master sent me to your wife.

Wherefore?

I forbear to utter it, for it is nothing to this matter, Antipho.
When I began to go into the nurserie, the boy, Mida came running to me,

Why he held me: he says, that it was forbidden any body to go in to his
mistress
Only Sophrona says he brought in Chremes hither the old-man's brother.
And he is now within with them; when I heard this, I went on to go to the door.
Upon my tip-toes softly; I came to it; I stood,

Catching at her speech on this fashion.

O brave Geta.

Here I heard
A most fine prank, so as truly I almost cried out for joy.

What was it?

What do you think?

I know not.

But it is a most wonderful thing.
Your uncle is found to be the father of your wife Phanium.

Ha,


He kept company with her mother long ago in Lemnus.

This is but a dream: is it likely that she should be ignorant of her own
father

Pho^mio,
Believe there is some reason; but do you think that I could understand all
thing
Without the door, which they did within amongst themselves?

And indeed I have also heard that tale.

Nay indeed I will tell you somewhat,

Not long after hewent in again with your father;
They both said they gave you leave to have her.
At the last, I am sent to seek you and bring you to them.

Ho, but then carry me; why do you leiter?

I will do it.

Pho^mio, fare you well.

Farewell Antipho.
I swear, it is well done, and I am glad
That they had so great fortune;
I have now an especial occasion to cozen the old-men,
And to take away from Phaedrsa his care concerning the money,

For as this money was given with an ill will,
It shall be bestowed on these: I have found out a way indeed, how I can
enforce this
Now I must take a new gesture and countenance;
But I will step aside into this next by-corner:

Whither I pretended to go to the Mart. I do not go.

O Fortuna! O fors fortuna! quantis commoditatibus
Quam subito hero meo Antiphoni open vestra hunc o^erastis diem?

Quidnam hic sibi vult?

Nosque amicos ejus exone^astis metu.
Sed mihi nunc ego cesso, qui non humetu hunc onero pallio,


Number tu intelligis quid hic narret?

Number tu?

Nihil.

Tantundem ego.

Ad lenonem hinc ire pergam; ibi nunc sunt.

Heus Geta.

Hem tibi. Number mirum tibi aut novum est
Revocari, cursum cum institueris?

Geta



Non manes?

Vapulabis; curialis vernula est, qui me vocat.

Id quidem tibi jam fiet, nisi resistis, verbero.

Familiarior^m oportet esse hunc, minitatur malum.
Sed isne est quem quaero an non? ipse est.

Congredere actutum.

Quid est?


Nam sine controversia ab Diis solus diligere, Antipho.

Ita velim; sed qui istuc credam ita esse dici mihi velim.

Satin' est, si te delibutum gaudio reddo?

Enecas.

Quin tu hinc pollicitationes aufer, and quod fers cedo.

Oh,
Phormio?

Aderam. Sed cessas?

Accipe, hem,
Ut modo argentum tibi dedimus apud forum: recta ad domum
Sumus profecti. Interea mittit me herus ad uxorem tuam.

Quamobrem?

Omitto proloqui, nam nihil ad hanc rem est, Antipho.
Ubi in gyneceum ire occipio, puer ad me occurrit Mida,

Quamobrem detineret me: ait esse vetitum intro ad he am accedere.
Sophrona modo fatrem huc, inquit, senis introduxit Chremem,
Eumque nunc esse intus cum illis; hoc ubi ego audivi, ad fores
Suspenso gradu placide ire perrexi, accessi, steti:

Hoc modo sermonem captans.

Euge Geta!

Hic pulcherrimum
Facinus audivi, ita pene hercle exclamavi gaudio.

Quid?

Quidnam arbitrare?

Nescio.

Atqui mirificissimum.
Patruus tuus pater est inventus Phanio uxori tuae.

Hem,


Cum ejus consuevit olim matre in Lemno clanculum.

Somnium: ut haec ignoraret suum patrem?

Aliquid credito
Phormio, esse causae: sed me censen' potuisse omnia
Intelligere extra ostium, intus quae inter sese ipsi egerunt?

Atque hercle ego quoque illam audivi sabulam.

Immo etiam dabo,

Haud multo post cum patre idem se recipit intro denuo:
Ait uterque tibi potestatem ejus habendae se dare;
Denique ego missus sum, te ut requirerem atque adducerem.

Hem, quin ergo, rape me; quid cessas?

Fecero.

Phormio, vale.

Vale Antipho.
Been ita me Dii ament f^ctum, gaudeo
Tantam fortunam de improviso esse his datam.
Summa eludendi occasio est mihi nunc senes,
Et Phaedriae curam adimere argentariam,

Nam idem hoc argentum ita ut datum est ingratis, his
Datum erit; hoc qui cogam, re ipsa repperi.
Nunc gestus mihi, vultusque est capiundus novus:
Sed hinc concedam in angiportum hunc proxumum,

Quo me assimula^ram ire ad mercatum, non eo.

I Have cause to give God great thanks, and I do t^^nk him,
Seeing these things, brother, have fallen out well ^or us.
Now, Phormio is to be met with all as soon as may be,
Before he wastfully spend our thirt^e pounds,


I will go see,
If Demipho be at home, that what --

But we were going to you, Phormio.

About this same errand perhaps.

Yes indeed.

I thought so.
Why were you going to me? that is a jest; are you afraid
Lest I should not do that, which I had once undertaken?

I have hither to ^ad a care of this one thing indeed, that I should be trusted.

Is she, as I said, of a good disposition?

Very good.

Therefore I come to you to te^^ you, Demipho,
That I am ready, when you will; give me my wife.

After I had observed that you were so very willing to it.

But this man has diss^aded me, from giving her to you.
For what a rumor will it be, says he, among the people, if you do it?
Heretos^re when it might be honestly done, then she was not giv^^ him;

Which you your self ere^^ile blamed before my face.

You b^^ool me stately enough.

How?

Do you ask*
Because indeed I cannot marry that other.
For with what face shall I return to he^ again, whom I have slighted?

Antipho dot^ let her go from him
With ^n ill will, say*

And besides I perceive my so^
Is indeed ^nwilling to let the woman go from him;
But step over to the market, I pray you, and give order
That that money be paid me again by a bill, Phormio*



What shall we do then?

If you will give me my wife,
Which you have betrothed, I will marry her; but if it be so that you would
Have her to tarry with you, let all the portion tarry here with me, Demipho.
For it is not reasonable that I should be deceived because of you,

To another, which gave me as big a portion.

Get you hence and be hanged with that greatness,
You runnagate; do you think I do not even now know you,
Or you doings withal?

I am provoked.

Would you marry this woman,


Do but try.

That my son
May dwell with her at your ^ouse, this was your plot.

I pray you, what do you say?

But do you give me my money.

Nay indeed, do you give me my wife.

Walk with me before a Justice.

Before a Justice? truly if you go on to be fur^her troublesome*



What I? you think that I perhaps
Patro^ize only them that have no portions:
I use also to do it to them that have portions.

What is that to us?

Nothing.
Here I knew a woman, whose husband another --

Ha.

What is the matter?
Wife ^ad at Lemnus.

I am quite undone.

By whom he ^ad


I am buried.

I will now go tell her these things too.

I pray you,
Do not do it.

Oh! was you be?

How he plays upon us?

We dismiss you.

These are but tales.

What will you have?
We forgive you the money which you have.

I hear you.

With your ^ond childish saying?
I will not, I will: I will, I will not: give me it again, take it.
What was said is unsaid; what was before confirmed, is now made void.

How, or whence did he know these things?

I know not;


This is strange, I swear.

I have gravelled them.

Ha,
Is it fit that he should carry away this so much money from us
Jeering us thus openly! truly we had better dye.
Therefore prepare to be of a manly and ready courage.

And that-you cannot now conceal it from your wife.
Now, Chremes, what she is likely to bear from others,
It is more pacifying for us to tell it our selves;
Then we may be able to be revenged of this filthy fellow


Alas, unless I look to my self, I am at a stay.
These men endeavor to come toward me with a mind to kill or be killed.

But I am afraid she cannot be pacified.

Have a ^ood heart,
I will make you friends again; presuming upon this, Chremes,
Seeing she is dead, by whom you had this daughter.


Truly, Demipho, you have provoked me not for his good.
Do you say at last, after you have done what you list in another country,
And have had no regard to this worthy gentlewoman,
But have offered her disgrace after a new fashion;

I will make her so incensed against you with these sayings,
That you shall not quench her, though you melt into tears.

A mischief which I wish might light upon him;
That any man should be so very a^dacious?

Into some solitary country?

I am now brought to that pass,
That I know not at all what I should do with him.

I kn^w,
Let us go before a Justice.

Before a Justice! hither, if you have any ^ist.

But follow him, and hold him, whilst I call out the servants hence.



Here is one action Against you.

Prosecute it by law then.

I have another against you, Chremes.

Carry this fellow away.

Do you do so? truly I have need (...) my voice.
Nausistrata, come ^orth.

Stop his mouth.

Look you, this base knave
How much he is able to do.

Nausistrata, I say.

Do you not hold your peace?



Except he follow, thump him on the belly with your fists,
Or put out his eye.

There is a place, where I will be revenged on you.

DIis merito magnas gratias habeo, atque ago,
Quand^ evene^e hae^ nobis frater prospe^e.
Quantum potest nunc conveniendus Phormio est,
Priusquam dilapidet n^stras triginta minas,


Demiphonem si d^mi est,
Visam; ut quod --

At nos ad te ibamus, Phormi^.

De eadem hac fortasse causa.

Ita hercle.

Credidi.
Quid ad me ibatis? ridiculum; an veremini,
Ne non id facerem, quod recepissem se^l?

Adhuc curavi unum hoc quidem, ut mihi esse^ fides.

Estne ita, ut dixi, liberalis?

Oppido.

Itaque ad vos venio nunciatum, Demipho.
Paratum me esse, ubi vultis* uxorem date.

Po^tquam tantopere id vos velle animum advorteram.

At hic de^ortatus est me, ne illam tibi darem,
Nam qui erit rumor populi, inquit, si id feceris?
Olim cum honest potuit, tunc non est data:

Quae ^ute dudum coram me incusaveras.

Satis superbe illuditis me.

Qui?

Rogas*
Qui^ ne alteram quidem illam potero ducere.
Nam quo redibo o^e ad eam, quam co^^empserim?

Antipbonem video ab s^ amittere
Invitum eam, inque.

Tum autem video fi^^um
Invitum sane mulie^em ab se ^mittere.
Sed transi sodes ad forum, atque illud mihi
Argentum rursum jube resc^ibi, Phormi^.



Quid igitur fiet?

Si vis mihi uxorem dare,
Quam despondisti, ducam; sin est, ut velis,
Manner illam apud te, dos hic omnis maneat, Demipho.
Nam non est aequum me propter vos decipi,

Remiserim, quae dotis tantundem dabat.

I in malam rem hi^c cum istac magnificentia*
Fugitive; etiam nunc credis te ignorarier,
Aut tua facta ade^?

Irritor.

Tu hanc duceres,


Fac periculum.

Ut filius Cum illa habitet apud te? hoc vestrum consilium fuit.

Quaeso quid narras?

Quin tu argentum cedo.

Immo ^e o tu uxorem cedo.

In jus ambula.

In jus? enimvero si porro esse odiosi pergitis.



Egone? vos me indotatis modo
Patrocinari fortasse arbitramini*
Etiam dotatis soleo.

Quid id nostra?

Nihil.
H^c quandam noram, cujus vir uxorem --

Hem.

Quid est?
Lemni habuit aliam*

Nullus sum.

Ex qua filiam


Sepultus sum.

Haec adeo ego illi jam denarrabo.

Obsecro,
Ne facias.

Oh, tun* is eras?

Ut ludos ^acit?

Missum te facimus.

Fabulae.

Quid vis ^ibi?
Argentum quod habes, condonamus te.

Audio:

I^^pta vestra puerili sententia?
Nolo, volo: volo, nolo: ^ursum cedo, cape:
Quod dictum, indictum est; quod modo erat ratum, irritum est.

Quo pacto, aut unde haec hic rescivit?

Nescio,


Monstri, ita me Dii ament, simile.

Injeci scrupulum.

Hem.
Hiccine ut a nobis tantum hoc argenti auferat
Tam aperte irridens? emori hercle satius est.
Animo virili praesentique ut sis para.

Neque id jam celare posse te uxorem tuam;
Nunc quod ipsa ex aliis auditura sit, Chreme,
Id nosmetipsos indicare placabilius est,
Tum hunc impuratum poterimus nostro modo


Atat, nisi mihi prospicio, haereo.
Hi gladiatorio animo ad me affectant viam.

At vereor ut placa^i possit.

Bono animo es.
Ego redigam vos in gratiam; hoc sretus, Chreme,
Cum e medio excessit, unde haec suscepta est tibi.


Non hercle ex re iftius me instigasti, Demipho.
Ain' tu tandem, ubi peregre tibi quod libitum fuit feceris,
Neque hujus sis veritus faeminae primariae,
Quin novo modo eifaceres contumelias;

His ego illam dictis ita tibi incensam dabo,
Ut ne restinguas, lachrymis si exstillaveris.

Malum, quod isti Dii Deaeque omnes duint,
Tantane affectum hominem quenquam esse audacia?

In solas terras?

In id redactus sum loci,
Ut quid agam ex illo nesciam prorsus.

Ego scio,
In jus eamus.

In jus? huc, si quid lubet.

At sequere, ac retine, dum ego hinc servos evoco.



Una injuria est
Tecum.

Lege agito ergo.

Altera est tecum, Chreme.

Rap^ hunc.

Itane agitis (...) enimvero voce est opus.
Nausistrata, exi.

Os opprime.

Impurum vide,
Quantum valet.

Nausistrata, inquam.

Non taces?



Nisi sequitur, pugnos in ventrem ingere,
Vel oculum exclude.

Est, ubi vos ulciscar, locus.

WHo names me?

Ah.

What a stir is there, I pray you,
My husband?

How now, why have you now held your peace?

What fellow is this?
Do you not answer me?

Would you have him to answer you,
Who indeed knows not where he is?

Take heed how you believe this fellow in any thing.



It is nothing.

What is it then that he says?

You shall know by and by:
Hark you.

Do you go on to believe him?

What, I pray you,
Should I believe him who has said nothing?

The poor man dotes For fear.

Truly it is not for nothing that you are so afraid.



Very well indeed: if you be not afraid,
And this be nothing that I say, do you tell.

You rogue! Should he tell you?

O you Sir, you have taken very great pains
For you brother.

My husband, do not you tell me?

But.

What but?

It is not needful to tell it.

For you, but it is needful for her to know it.


Ah, what say you?

Do not you hold your peace?

Unknown to you.

Woe is me.

He married a wife.

My husband, God sent better news.

It is done so.

I am undone poor woman.

And by her he has
One daughter already, whilst you was asleep.

What do we?

O strange, an unworthie and naughty prank.



Was any thing done to day more unworthilie?
Who when they come to have more wives, then become old men.
Demipho, I appeal to you, for it quite irks me to speak with this man himself.
Were these things your often journeyings, and long tarryings
At Lemnus? was this the cheapness, that lessened our rent?

Nausistrata, I do not deny but here is blame deserved in this matter:
But such as may be pardoned.

You talk to one that is dead.

For he neither did it through neglect, or dislike of you,
Being full of wine almost above fifteen years ago, he got
Her with child, of whom this daughter is born, and he never touched her
afterward

Wherefore I entreat you, as your other doings are, that you would take it
moderately

What I take it moderately? I desire poor woman to be shut of this business.
But what should I hope? should I think he will less offend further hereafter
through age
He was then already an old man; if old age makes men bashful.
Demipho?
What do you now allege to me, why I should expect or hope that it be no more
so

For them that have leisure to go to the burial of Chremes, hoe, it is time.
I will tell them thus? go to now, go to; let who will provoke Phormio;
I will make him be slain with such a misfortune, as this man is.

She has that, which she may ring in his ear to him, as long as he lives.

Do I think this was done through my desert? why should I now mention those
things, Demipho
Severally, what a wife I have been toward him?

I know all things
As well as you.

This seems not to be done through my desert.

No in no wise.

Pardon him: he increateth; he confesses; he clears himself; what would you
have more

But indeed before she give him his pardon, I will provide for my self, and
Phaedtia
Ho Nausistrata, before you be too hasty to answer him, bear me.

What is the matter?

I have got thirty pounds from him by a trick*


Ha, what say you?

Do you think it such an unworthy thing, if your son
A young man have one sweet heart, when you have two wives?
Are you ashamed of nothing? with what face can you chide him? answer me.

You shall do as you will.

Nay that you may now know my mind,

Before I see my son; I leave all to his judgment.
What he shall command, I will do.

You are a wise woman, Nausistrata.

Is this sufficient for you?

Yea truly Ico me off gallantly and and finely, and beyond my hope.

Do you tell me your name, what it is.

Mine? Phormio,
Truly a friend to your family, and most to your Phaedria.

Phormio, truly but I will do and say for you hereafter any thing I shall be
able
And what you shall desire.

You speak bountifully.

Indeed it is your desert.

Will you do one thing first to day, which I may be glad on, Nausistrata,
And which your husband may not abide to see?

I desire to do it.

Invite me to supper.



Let us go in hence.

But where is Phaedria
Our Umpire?

I will cause that he shall be here by and by. Fare ye well, and clap your
hands

QUis nominat me?

Hem.

Quid istuc turbae est, obsecro,
Mi vir?

Ehem, quid nunc obticuisti?

Quis hic homo est?
Non mihi respondes?

Hiccine ut tibi respondeat,
Qui hercle ubi sit, nescit?

Cave isti quicquam credas.



Nihil est.

Quid ergo est, quod istic narrat?

Jam scies;
Ausculta.

Pergin' credere?

Quid ego, obsecro,
Huic credam qui nihil dixit?

Delirat miser Timore.

Non pol temere est, quod tu tam times.



Recte sane; quando nihil times,
Et hoc nihil est, quod dico ego, tu narra.

Scelus! Tibi narret?

Eho tu, factum est abs te sedulo Pro fratre.

Mi vir, non mihi narras?

At.

Quid at?

Non opus est dicto.

Tibi quidem; at scito huic opus est.
In Lemno.

Hem; quid ais?

Non taces?

Clam te.

Hei mihi.

Uxorem duxit.

Mihomo, Dii melius duint.

Sic factum est.

Perii misera.

Et inde filiam
Suscepit jam unam, dum tu dormis.

Quid agimus?

Pro Dii immortales, facinus indignum and malum?



An quicquam hodie est factum indignius?
Qui mihi, ubi ad uxoros ventum est, tum fiunt senes.
Demipho, te appello, nam me cum hoc ipso distaedet loqui;
Haeccine erant itiones crebrae, and mansiones diutinae
Lemni? haeccine erat, quae nostros fructus minucbat, vilitas?

Nausistrata, esse in hac re culpam meritam non nego,
Sed ea quae sit ignoscenda.

Verba fiunt mortuo.

Nam neque negligentia tua, neque odio id fecit tuo.
Vinolentus fere abhinc annos quindecim mulierculam
Eam compressit, unde haec nata est, neque post illam unquam attigit.

Quam ob rem te oro, ut alia facta tua sunt, aequo animo hoc feras.

Quid? ego aequo animo? cupio misera in hac re jam desungier.
Sed quid sperem? aetate porro minus peccaturum putem?
Jam tum erat senex, senectus siquidem verecundos facit.
Demipho?
Quid mihi nunc affers, quamobrem exspectem aut sperem porro non fore?

Exequias Chremeti, quibus est commodum ire, hem tempus est.
Sic dabo; age nunc, age, Phormionem, qui volet, lacessito.
Faxo tali cum mactatum, atque hic est, infortunio.

Habet haec, ei quod dum vivat usque ad aurem obganniat*

An meo merito credo? quid nunc ea comme norem, Demipho.
Singillatim, qualis ego in hunc fue^

Novi aeque omni^
Tecum.

Merito non hoc meo videtur factum.

Minime gentium.

Ignosce: orat, confitetur, purgat: quid vis amplius?

Enimvero prius quam haec dat veniam, mihi prospiciam, and Phaedriae.
Heus Nausistrata, prius quam huic respondes temere, audi.

Quid est?

Ego minas triginta per fallaciam ab illo abstuli;


Hem quid ais?

Adeon' indignum tibi videtur, filius
Homo adolescens unam si habet amicam? tu uxores duas.
Nihil pudere? quo ore illum objurgabis? responde mihi.

Facies ut voles.

Immo, utjam meam scias sententiam,

Prius quam gnatum videro; ejus judicio permitto omnia.
Quod is jubebit faciam.

Mulier sapiens es, Nausistrata.

Satin' est tibi?

Immo vero pulchre discedo, and probe, and praeter spem.

Tu tuum nomen dic, quod est.

Mihin'? Phormio,
Phaedriae.

Phormio, at ego ecastor postliac tibi quod potero, and qu^ voles,
Faciam and dicam.

Benign dicis.

Pol meritum est tuum.

Vin' primum hodie facere, quod ego gaudeam Nausistrata,
Et quod tuo viro oculi doleant?

Cupio.

Me ad coenam voca.



Eamus int^o hinc.

Fiat; sed ubi est Phaedria
Judex noster?

Jam hic faxo aderit. Vos valete, and plaudite.

DOMINE.
