POOR silly Diminutive Chit --
What fancy bewitches,
Thy little fantastical Wit,
Now to compare with the great God of Riches?

Blind Idol of the World, produced from dirt,
Thou, that neither Temple have, nor Court:
Whilst I both Gods, and Men control,
Enshrined in every Humane Soul.

Sure Heaven and Earth did a Governor lack,
When they made a young Fowler,
Their Lord Controller,
That never was worth a rag to his Back.

Pride and Envy; makes thee bear me a grudge;
But Plutus, know, I scorn to be my own Judge.

How will thou avoid it?

Let Momus decide it.

Momus!

Momus!

Come, come away,
Make no delay;
Why, why do you stay?
Come, come away.

Ha! ha! ha! What do I see,
The aged God of Wealth,
With this young little Elf?
Well, and how do you both agree?

It Is thee we call --

It Is thee we call.

By whom the Gods --

By whom the Gods,

Are quitted -- --

Or condemned.

When they are at odds.

Be just, and end the strife,
Who bears the greatest sway in humane life;
This little Dandy-prat,
Or I, that am so glorious, plump, and fat?

I am prepared to hear both sides,
And then to judge as Reason guides.

Daughters of Jove, and Themis, we
Keep the bright Gates of Heaven, and see
What passes in the Seats above,
Where all the Gods give way to Love.

His uncontrolled Commands,
Forced Neptune's Trident from his Hands;
Phoebus his Quiver durst not own,
And Hercules his Club laid down:
Mavors he made his Helmet quit,
Tore Hermes's Wings from off his Feet;
And which was yet a greater wonder,
Great Jove disarmed of all his Thunder.

No wonder then,
That Mortal Men,
So feebly should resist his Charms,
To whom the Gods surrender up their Arms.
No wonder then,

So feebly should resist his Charms,
To whom the Gods surrender up their Arms.

Short is what we have to say:
In the Circle of Mankind,
At Cupid's heels you will surely find
Us, always merry, blithe and gay;
None, none can tell,
His steps so well,
For we trace him every day:

From sporting,

To Courting;

From Courting

To Billing;

From Billing

To Willing;

From Willing,

To Wedding;

From Wedding

To Bedding.
Thus round, round, around, in a circle whirled,
It Is our little God Cupid, sustains the World.

Come, I have something to propose,
Will bring ye quickly to a close.
Cupid and Plutus together.
Then to the point, and set us right.

Two Matches are confirmed this Night;
Love makes the One, the other Gold,
Now which is longest like to hold.

The Dowry'd Wife imperious grows,
And fills the House with noise:

As loud the Monyless too crows,
For want of my brave yellow Boys.

Then Plutus, take the Day thy self,
The Night I give this little Elf:
Thus reconciled, shake hands -- It Is more
Then ever Momus did before --
So with a Jolly Dance, dismiss,
The Brides and Bridegrooms to their Bliss.
So with with a jolly Dance dismiss,
The Brides and Bridegrooms to their Bliss.

Well, Clitander, since I find you take your bad Bargain so contentedly, I Will
give thee a brace of Thousands to make thee amends -- My Daughter shall never
be upbraided for a Portionless Wife, I Will tell thee that, Boy

Clitander, Kind Sir, I humbly thank you;
Young Men in heat of Blood, their Flames approve,
But when all is done, it is Money binds our Love.

And for my part, I often have been told,
There Is nothing like dancing to the Music of Gold.
