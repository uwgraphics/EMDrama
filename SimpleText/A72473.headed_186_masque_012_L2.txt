Room, room, for my Horse will wince,
If he come within so many yards of a Prince,
And though he have not on his wings,
He will do strange things.
He is the Pegasus that uses
To wait on Warwick Muses;
And on gaudy-dayes he paces
Before the Coventrie Graces;
For to tell you true, and in rhyme,
He was foald in Q. Elizabeth's time,
When the great Earl of Lester
In this Castle did feast her.
Now, I am not so stupid
To think, you think me a Cupid;
Or a Mercury, that sit him:
Though these Cocks here would fit him.
But a spirit very civil,
Neither Poets God, nor Devil,
An old Kenelworth Fox,
The Ghost of Captain Cox,
For which I am the bolder,
To wear a Cock on each shoulder.
This Captain Cox, by St. Mary,
Was at Bullen with King Hary;
And (if some do not vary)
Had a goodly library,
By which he was discerned
To be one of the learned
To entertain the Queen here,
When last she was seen here.
And for the Town of Coventrie
To act to her soveraigntie.
But so his lot fell out,
That serving then afoot,
And being a little man;
When the skirmish began
'Twixt the Saxon, and the Dane,
(For thence the story was taken)
He was not so well seen
As he would have been of the Queen.
Though this sword were twice so long
As any man's else in the throng
And for his sake, the Play
Was called for the second day.
But he made a vow
(And he performs it now)
That were he alive, or dead,
Hereafter, it should never be sed
But Cap. Cox would serve on horse
For better or for worse,
If any Prince came hither.
And his horse should have a feather
Nay, such a Prince it might be
Perhaps he should have three.
Now, Sir (in your approach
The rumbling of your Coach
Awaking me, (his Ghost)
I come to play your Host;
And feast your eyes and ears,
Neither with Dogs, nor Bears,
Though that have been a fit
Of our maine-shire wit,
In times heretofore,
But now, we have got a little more.
These then that we present
With a most loyal intent
And (as the Author says)
No ill meaning to the Catholic faith,
Are not so much beasts, as Fowls,
But a very Nest of Owls,
And natural, so thrive I,
I found them in the Ivy,
A thing, that though I blundred at,
It may in time be wondered at,
If the place but affords
Any store of lucky birds,
As I make'em to flush
Each Owl out of his bush.
Now, these Owls (some say) were men,
And they may be so again,
If once they endure the light
Of your highness sight:
For Bank-rupts, we have known
Rise to more then their own.
With a little-little savor
Of the Princes favor,
But, as you like their tricks,
I Will spring'em, they are but six.
Hey, Owl first.
This Bird is London bred
As you may see by his horned head.
And had like to have been taken
At his shop in Jvy-lane,
Where he sold by the peney
Tobacco, as good as any;
But, whether it did provoke
His conscience, he sold smoke;
Or some other toy he took,
Toward his calling to look:
He fled by Moone-shine thence;
And broke for sixteen pence.
Hey, Owl second.
This too, the more is the pity
Is of the breed, of the same City,
A true Owl of London
That gives out he is undone,
Being a Cheese-monger,
By trusting two of the younger
Captains, for the hunger
Of their halfe-staru'd number;
Whom since they have shipped away:
And left him God to pay,
With those ears for a badge
Of their dealing with his Madge.
Hey, Owl third.
A pure native Bird
This, and though his hue
Be not Coventrie-blue,
Yet is he undone
By the thread he has spunne,
For since the wise town
Has let the sports down
Of May-games, and Morris,
For which he right sorry is:
Where their Maids, and their Makes,
At dancings, and Wakes,
Had their Napkins, and poses,
And the wipers for their noses.
And their smocks all-be-wrought
With his thread which they bought,
It now lies on his hands,
And having neither wit, nor lands,
Is ready to hang, or choke him,
In a skeyne of that, that broke him.
Hey, Owl fourth.
Was once a Bankrupt of worth;
And having run a shifting race
At last by money, and grace,
Got him a Sergeants place,
And to be one of Chase.
A full so rtnight was not spent,
But out comes the Parliament,
Takes away the use of his Mace,
And left him in a worse, then his first case.
Hey, Owl the fifth.
But here was a defeat,
Never any so great,
Of a Don, a Spanish Reader,
Who had thought to have bin the Leader
(Had the Match gone on)
Of our Ladies one by one,
And triumphed our whole Nation,
In his Rodomant fashion:
But now since the breach,
He has not a Scholar to teach.
Hey, Owl sixth.
The Bird-bringer up is a Knight,
But a passionate wight,
Who, since the Act against swearing,
(The tale's worth your hearing)
In this short times growth
Has at twelve pence an oath;
For that (I take it) is the rate
Sworn himself out of his estate.
The third varied.
A Crop-eard Scrivener, this,
Who when he heard but the whisper of moneys to come down,
Fright got him out of Town
With all the Bills and Bands
Of other men's in his hands,
And cried, who will drive the trade,
Since such a Law they had made:
It was not he that broke.
Two in the hundred spoke.
Nor cared he for the curse,
He could not hear much worse,
He had his ears in his purse.
