I Think or hope, at least, the Coast is clear,
That none but Men of Wit and Sense are here:
That our Bear-Garden Friends are all away,
Who bounce with Hands and Feet, and cry Play, Play.
Who to save Coach-hire, trudge along the Street,
Then print our Matted Seats with dirty Feet;
Who, while we speak, make Love to Orange-Wenches,
And between Acts stand strutting on the Benches:
Where got a Cock-horse, making vile Grimaces,
They to the Boxes show their Booby Faces.
A Merry-Andrew, such a Mob will serve,
And treat 'em with such Wit as they deserve:
Let 'em go People Ireland, where there is need
Of such new Planters to repair the Breed;
Or to Virginia or Jamaica Steer,
But have a care of some French Privateer;
For if they should become the Prize of Battle,
They Will take 'em Black and White for Irish Cattle.
Arise true Judges in your own Defense,
Control those Foplings, and declare for Sense:
For should the Fools prevail, they stop not there,
But make their next Descent upon the Fair.
Then rise ye Fair; for it concerns you most,
That Fools no longer should your Favors boast;
It Is time you should renounce 'em, for we find
They plead a senseless Claim to Woman kind:
Such Squires are only fit for Country Towns,
To stink of A^e; and dust a Stand with Clownes:
Who, to be chosen for the Lands Protectors,
Tope and get Drunk before their Wise Electors.
Let not Farce Lovers your weak Choice upbraid,
But turn 'em over to the Chambermaid.
Or if they come to see our Tragic Scenes,
Instruct them what a Spartan Hero means:
Teach 'em how manly Passions ought to move,
For such as cannot Think can never Love:
And since they needs will judge the Poets Art,
Point 'em with Fescu's to each shining Part.
Our Author hopes in you, but still in pain,
He fears your Charms will be employed in vain;
You can make Fools of Wits, we find each Hour,
But to make Wits of Fools, is past your Power.


DEjected! no, it never shall be said,
That Fate had power upon a Spartan Soul:
My mind on its own Center stands unmoved,
And Stable; as the Fabric of the World:
Propt on it self; still I am Cleomenes:
I fought the Battle bravely, which I Lost;
And lost it, but to Macedonians,
The Successors of those who Conquered Asia.
'Twas for a Cause too, such a Cause I fought.
Unbounded Empire hung upon my Sword:
Greece, like a lovely Heifer, stood in view,
To see the Rival Bulls each other gore:
But wished the Conquest mine.
I fled; and yet I languish not in Exile;
But here in Egypt, whet my Blunted Horns;
And meditate new Fights, and chew my Loss.
Ah! why ye Gods, must Cleomenes wait
On this Effeminate Luxurious Court,
For tardy helps of base Egytian Bands?
Why have not I, whose individual mind
Would ask a Nation of such Souls t'inform it,
Why have not I ten Thousand hands to fight
It all my self? and make the Work my own?

Is this well done? or like the King of Sparta?
Or like my Son? to waste your time in Tears?
What have you done, that you avoid Mankind?
And sculk in Corners like a Guilty Slave?

We have been seeking you, my dearest Lord,
Through all the shady Walks and dark Retreats
Of Secret Care; That false deluding Friend,
That only sooths and keeps you Company,
To prey upon your last remains of Life.

I Have heard you --

Hear her still; She tells you true.
This Melancholy Flatters; but Unmans you.
What is it else, but Penury of Soul;
A Lazy Frost, a numness of the Mind;
That Locks up all the Vigor to Attempt,
By barely Crying, it is Impossible?

You both mistake me: That I Grieve, it is true:
But it is a Grief of Fury; not Despair!
And if a manly drop or Two fall down,
It scalds along my Cheeks, like the Green Wood
That sputtring in the Flame works outward into Tears.

Why would you leave me then, and be alone?
Indeed it was a Churlish kind of sorrow;
Indeed it was, t'engross it all your self;
And not permit me to endure my share.
Think you, because I am of tender Mould,
I cannot suffer and partake your burdens;
Alas! I suffer more by not partaking

My Wife! My Mother! O! I am so divided,
That I grieve most for both, and love both most;
Two twining Vines about this Elm, whose fall
Must shortly -- Very shortly crush you both,
And yet I will not go to Ground,
Without a Noble Ruin round my Trunk;
The Forest shall be shaken when I sink,
And all the neighboring Trees
Shall groan and fall beneath my vast Destruction.

That Is something yet, an earnest of an Action;
Another Groan or two, and all goes well.

Well: I will live.

Thou shall.

I Will try at least.

Do not go back: and bate of what thou said

Peace, peace: good Grandmother; he lives already,
And Conquers too, in saying he will try;
Nay, if the King of Sparta says he will do it,
I ask no more then that;
For it is below a King to tell a Lie.

But where is the means?

The means is in the daring;
Had my own Mother lived, and asked that Question
I should have thought my Father had begot me,
Without her help, as Pallas sprung from Jove.

Think thou, he can defend us all, alone?

No -- for I mean to help him.

That my Boy, my hopeful Lions Whelp

So Hector hugged his young Astyanax;
Went out to fight and never saw him more.

But why did not Astyanax go with Hector?

Because he was a Child, and could not go.

Was he a Spartan Child?

Oh no! a Trojan.

There Is it, a Trojan Child: But grant me this,
There are no Spartan-Children we are born Men,
And though you say, I have but Fifteen years,
We Spartans take ten Strides before our Age,
And start beyond dull Nature.

Let me but live to shadow this young Plant,
From Blites and Storms; He Will soon shoot up a Hero:
He must; I got him in the pride of Conquest;
For coming back from my first Maiden Battle,
Wherein I made the Great Aratus fly,
And added all his Laurels to my Brow,
I well remember that I spurred it hard,
And like a Meteor, shot before my Troops,
To reach my Love that night; I was a Bridegroom,
Or scarce had lost that name, and stealing home,
According to my Countries modest use,
I found my Aegiatis just undrest,
Wearying the gods with Vows for my return,
My Transport was so great, I could not stay,
But kissed, and took her trembling in my Arms,
And in that Fury of my Love, I stamped,
This Image of my Soul.
What, my Pantheus?
Where have thou been this long long Year of Hours?

Where I have past a merry Mornings Walk,
With the best Company.

With whom?

Why with my self, in laughing at the World,
Making a Farce of Life, where Knaves and Fools,
And Madmen, that is all Human-kind were Actors.

And what part Acted you?

As little as I could: And daily would have less,
So please the Gods, for that is a Wise Man's part.

Would I could share thy Balmy, even Temper,
And Milkiness of Blood.

You may.

As how?

By! but forgetting you have been a King.

Then must I rust in Egypt, never more
Appear in Arms, and be the Chief of Greece?
Now, by yon Blew Palace,
The Mansion of my great Fore-father Hercules
I would loose o're-agen Sellasia's Field
Rather than Fight behind, when proud Aratus led the Grecian Van.

What, when the lively Trumpets sound a Charge,
The word of Battle may be Hercules,
And after our great Grandsires Name, Aratus
Cries Cleomenes, bring you up the Rear.

If Fortune takes not off this Boy betimes,
He Will make mad work, and Elbow all his Neighbors.

My Neighbors! Little: Elbow all the World*
And push off Kings, like Counters from the Board,
To place my self the foremost.

What will thou be, young Cockeril, when thy Spurs
Are grown to sharpness?

Why? I Will be a Spartan.
For if I said a King, I should say less:
I mean a Spartan while I live on Earth;
But when in Heaven, I Will stand next Hercules,
And thrust between my Father and the God.

Do you not view, my Lord?
As in a Glass, your Darling Fault, Ambition,
Reflected in your Son?

My Virtue rather:
I love to see him sparkle out betimes,
For 'twas my Flame that lighted up his Soul:
I am pleased with my own Work; Jove was not more
With Infant Nature, when his spacious Hand
Had rounded this huge ball of Earth, and Seas,
To give it the first push, and see it roll
Along the vast Abyss.

My Mother would have had my Youth brought up
To Spin with Girls in Sparta.

Well said, my Boy; Yet Hercules they say
Took up the Distass once.

Yes, when he had been Conquered by a Woman.

One thing I had forgot, which may import you,
Greece.

Thou were
Indeed forgetful, not to tell me that,
For, from my first arrival on this Coast,
This fatal Egypt, where I fled for Refuge,
In three long Months I have not heard from Greece.
What makes thee think I shall have news so soon?

As walking on the Beach I saw a Ship
Just entering in the Port, and on the Deck
Stood Coenus.

Coenus, said thou?

Yes, our Coenus, the rich Messenian Lord;
I saw and knew him, but amidst the shouts
Of Mariners, and busy Care to sling
His Horses soon ashore -- He saw not me.

Then I shall hear of thee once more, Dear Country;
I fear too soon; shall hear how proud Antigonus
Led over Eurota's Banks, his Conquering Troops
And first, to wondering Sparta -- showed a King,
A King that was not Hers:
Then I shall hear of Sacrilege and Murders,
And Fires, and Rapes on Matrons, and on Maids.

Such news we must expect.

O happy Ghosts!
Of those that fell in the last fatal Fight,
And lived not to survive their Countries Loss;
Base as I was -- I should have fallen there too;
But first have raised a Mountain of the Dead,
To choke their way to Sparta.

Thus I knew
Your Blood would boil, and therefore I delaid
So long to tell you Coenus was arrived.

Go:
My Mother, my Cleora, and my Boy --
Your Ears would be polluted with such Ills;
Which I must try to mollify before
They reach your tender hearing.

I Obey you.
But let not Grief disorder you too much
For what you lost. --
For me, while I have You, and you are kind,
I ask no more of Heaven.

I go too,
Because my King and Father bids me go:
Else, I have sternness in my Soul enough
To hear of Murders, Rapes, and Sacrilege:
For those are Soldiers work; and I would hear 'em
To spur me to Revenge.

He Is here already.
Now bear it like your self.

I am armed against it.

I heard, Sir, you were refug'd in this Court,
And come to beg a favor.

Good! a Favor!
Sure, thou mistak'st me for the King of Egypt;
And think I govern here?

You Are Cleomenes.

No thanks to Heaven for that: I should have died,
And then I had not been this Cleomenes.

You promised Patience, Sir.

Thou art a Scurvy Monitor, I am Patient.
Do I foam at Lips;
Or stare at Eyes: Methinks I am wondrous Patient.
Now, thou shall see how I can swallow Gall.
I prithee, Gentle Coenus, tell the Story. --
Of Ruined Sparta; leave no Circumstance
Untold of all their Woes: And I will hear thee,
As unconcerned, as if thou told'st a Tale
Of ruined Troy. I prithee tell us how
The Victors robbed the Shrines, polluted Temples,
Ransacked each Wealthy House: No, spare me that,
Poor honest Sparta had no Wealth to lose.
But when thou come to tell of Matrons ravished,
And Virgins forced; Then raise thy Voice,
And let me hear their Howlings,
And dreadful shrieks, as in the act of Rape.

Again you are distempered!


I was but reaching him to grace his Tale
With decent Horror.

Your sick Imagination feigns all this;
Now hear a truth, and wonder!

Has not the Conqueror been at Sparta?

Yes.

Nay; then I know what follows Victory.

You interrupt as if you would not know.

Then if you will Imagine, think some King,
Who loved his People, took a peaceful Progress
To some far distant place of his Dominions;
Smiled on his Subjects as he rode in Triumph,
And strewn his Plenty, wheresoe'er he passed.
Nay, raise your Thoughts yet higher. Think some Deity,
Some better Ceres drawn along the Sky,
By Gentle Dragons, scattered as she flew,
Her fruitful Grains upon the teeming Ground,
And bad new Harvests rise.

Do we Dream, Pantheus?

No sure! We are awake -- but it is he Dreams.

The Soldiers marched, as in Procession, slow;
And entered Sparta like a Choir of Priests,
As if they feared to tread on holy Ground.
No Noise was heard; no Voice, but of the Crier,
Proclaiming Peace, and Liberty to Sparta;
At that a peal of loud applause rang out,
And thin'd the Air, till even the Birds fell down
Upon the Shouters Heads: The Shops flew open,
And all the busy Trades renewed their Tasks:
No Law was changed, no Custom was controlled;
That had Lycurgus lived, or you returned,
So Sparta would have shown.

If this be true!

If this indeed be true,
Then farewell Sparta.

Hear me out.
He reaped no fruit of Conquest, but their Blessings;
Nor stayed three Days in Sparta; Summoned thence,
With sudden News that a Barbarian Host,
Was entered Macedonia!
And like a Mighty Deluge, rolling on,
Swept all before 'em. Thus alarmed, he left us;
Marched Homeward; Met and Fought 'em; Nay, and Lived
To say the Field is mine.

Died of his Wounds?

Not so; but straining loud his feeble Voice,
To animate his Soldiers, broke a Vein;
And in a purple Vomit poured his Soul.

O Blessed! Blessed Coenus! for this happy News.

O Wretch! O Born to all misfortunes! Cursed,
Cursed Cleomenes!

How Is this! Are these the thanks you pay the Gods?
Who freed your Sparta, and removed by Death
Your only fatal Foe!

O Blind Pantheus!
Can thou not find, that had I but deferred
Sellasia's Fight three Days; but three short Days:
Fate then had fought my Battle with Antigonus;
And I not fighting had been still a King.

That Is true; but that you knew not when you fought.

Why therefore, once again, Cursed Cleomenes!
It Is not to be endured.
That Fate of Empires, and the fall of Kings
Should turn on flying Hours, and Catch of Moments.

Now, by my Soul, it is Lazy Wickedness,
To rail at Heaven, and not to help your self.
Heaven's but too kind, in offering you the means:
Your Fate, once more, is laid upon the Anvil:
Now pluck up all the Spartan in your Soul;
Now stretch at every stroke and Hammer out,
A new and nobler Fortune;
Else may the Peaceful Ground restore the Dead,
And give up Old Antigonus again.

I thank thee: Thou have added Flame to Fury.
The Spartan Genius shall once more be rowz'd;
Our Household Gods, that droop upon our Hearths,
Each from his Venerable Face shall brush
The Macedonian Soot, and shine again.

Now you confess the Spartan.

Haste, Pantheus!
I struggle like the Priestess with a God;
With that oppressing God, that works her Soul.
Haste to Cleanthes, my Egyptian Friend;
That only Man that Egypt ever made:
He Is my Lucina. Say my Friendship wants him
To help me bring to light a Manly Birth;
Which to the wondering World I shall disclose,
Or if he fail me, perish in my Throws.

THe King sent for me, say thou! and to Council!

And I was coming to you, on that Message,
Just when I met Pantheus.

Good Omen, Sir, of some intended good,
Your Fortune mends: she reconciles apace,
When Egypt makes th'Advances.

Rise a Prophet.
For since his Fathers death, this Ptolomey,
Has minded me no more
Then Boys their last Years Gugaws.
Petition on Petition; Prayer on Prayer,
For Aid, or free Dismission, all Unanswered;
As Cleomenes were not worth his Thought,
Or He, that God, which Epicurus dreamt;
Disclaiming Care, and lolling on a Cloud.

At length, it seems it pleases him to wake.

Yes, for himself, not you; he is drenched too deep,
To wake on any Call, but his own danger:
My Father, his wise Pilot, has observed
The Face of Heaven, and sees a gathering Storm,
I know not from what quarter, but it threatens.
And while it Threats, he wants such hands as yours;
But when it is over, the Thoughtless King returns,
To Native sloth, shifts sides, and slumbers on.

Sure, he will remember to reward those Hands,
That helped him from the plunge.

You Dream, Pantheus!
Of former times, when Gratitude was Virtue;
Reward him! Yes, like Aesop's Snake, the wretch
That warmed him in his Bosom: We are Tools,
Vile abject things created for his use,
As Beasts for Men; as Oxen draw the Yoke,
And then are sacrificed.

I would not use him so.

You are not Ptolomy,
Nor is He Cleomenes.

I Will press him home,
To give me my dispatch; few Ships will serve
To bear my little Band and me to Greece;
I will not ask him one of his Egyptians;
No, Let 'em keep 'em all for Slaves and Stallions,
Fit only to beget their Successors.

Excepting one Egyptian, that is my self.

Thou need'st not be excepted; Thou art only,
Misplanted in a base degenerate Soil;
But Nature when she made thee, meant a Spartan.

Then if your Father will but second us. --

I dare not promise for him, but I Will try,
He loves me, Love and Interest sometimes
May make a Statesman honest.

For the King,
I know he will not refuse us, for he dares not;
A Coward is the kindest Animal,
It Is the most giving Creature in a fright.

Say the most promising, and there you hit him.

Well, I Will attack him on the shaking side,
That next his fearful Heart.

I come to mind you of the late Request,
You would not hear: Be pleased t'engage this Lord
And then it may succeed.

What would thou, Coenus?

I brought along
Some Horses of the best Thessalian breed,
High spirited and strong, and made for War;
These I would sell the King.

Mistaken Man:
Thou should have brought him Whores and Catamites;
Such Merchandise is fit for such a Monarch.

Would thou bring Horses here to shame our Men?
Those very words of Spirited and War,
Are Treason in our Clime.

From the King downward, (if there be a downward,
From Ptolomy to any of his Slaves!)
No true Egyptian ever knew in Horses
The Far Side from the Near.

Cleomenes told thee true: Thou should have brought
A soft pad Strumpet for our Monarch's use,
Though thanked be Hell, we want not one at home!
Our Master's Mistress, she that Governs all.
It Is well ye Powers, ye made us but Egyptians,
You could not have imposed
On any other People such a Load
As an Effeminate Tyrant and a Woman.

Sell me thy Horses, and at my return,
When I have got from Conquered Grecce the Pelf
That Noble Sparta scorns, I Will pay their value.

Just as you paid me for the fair Estate
I sold you there.

What Is that you mutter?



I fear he is gone away dissatisfied.

I Will make it up: Those Horses I present you,
You Will put 'em to the use that Nature meant 'em.

I burden you too much!

If you refuse, you burden me much more:
A Trifle this,
A singing Eunuch's price; A Pandar's Fee
Exceeds this Sum at Court.
The King expects us

Come after us, Pantheus;
And bring my Boy Cleonidas along,
I Will show his Youth this base Luxurious Court,
Just as in sober Sparta we expose
Our drunken Helotes: Only with design
To wean our Children from the vice of Wine.

No more of Business.

Sir, the Council waits you!

Council! What Is that? a pack of Bearded Slaves,
Grave Faces, Saucy Tongues, and Knavish Hearts,
That never speak one word but Self's at bottom;
The Scavengers that sweep State-nusances,
And are themselves the greatest. I Will no Council.

Remember you appointed them, this day.

I had forgot, 'twas my Cassandra's Birthday.

Your Brother Magas daily grows more dangerous,
And has the Soldiers Hearts.

I Will cut him off.

Not so soon done as said: The Spartan King
Was summoned for Advice, and waits without.

His Business is to wait.

Be pleased to Sign these Papers: They are all
Of great concern!

My pleasure is of more.
How I! could curse my Name of Ptolomy:
For it is so long; it asks an Hour to write it;
By Heaven, I Will change it into Jove or Mars!
Or any other civil Monosyllable,
That will not tire my Hand.

These are for Common Good.

I am glad of that:
Those shall be sure to wait.

Orders to pay the Soldiers, ripe for Mutiny;
They may Revolt.

To whom?

The Man you fear:
Your Brother, Magas.

That Is indeed the danger:
Give me the Physic; Let me swallow quick --
There Is Ptolomy for that; Now, not one more,
For every Minute I expect Cassandra
To call me to the Music,
If she should find me at this rare Employment,
Of Signing out her Treasures?

The rest are only Grants to her you love,
And places for her Friends.

I Will Sign 'em all; were every one a Province:
Thou know her Humor, not to brook denial!
And then a Quarrel on her Birthday too
Would be of ill presage.

I heard you waired, but you will pardon me,
I was not sooner Dressed.

Thus I begin my Homage to the Day
That brought me forth a Mistress, and am proud
To be your foremost Slave.

Our little Entertainment waits; not worth
A longer Ceremony, please to Grace it?

NO no, poor suffering Heart no Change endeavor,
Choose to sustain the smart, rather than leave her;
My ravished Eyes behold such Charms about her,
I can dye with her, but not live without her.
One tender Sigh of hers to see me Languish,
Will more than pay the price of my past Anquish:
Beware O cruel Fair, how you smile on me,
'Twas a kind Look of yours that has undone me.
Love has in store for me one happy Minute,
And She will end my pain who did begin it;
Then no day void of Bliss, or Pleasure leaving,
Ages shall slide away without perceiving:
Cupid shall guard the Door the more to please us,
And keep out Time and Death when they would seize us:
Time and Death shall depart, and say in flying,
Love has found out a way to Live by Dying.
Egyptian King?
And am I called upon the Grave Debate,
To judge of trilling Notes and tripping Feet?

It Is of a piece with all the rest of Ptolomey!
A Singing and a Dancing Government.
O Egypt, Egypt! Thou art grown the Lees
Of all the World; The slime of thy own Nyle.
Sure, we had neither Human Syres, nor Mothers;
The Sun and Nyle begot us; We Are so Cowardly,
And yet so proud; so many Gods we have,
And yet not One --

No more -- They seem to gaze on me with wonder.

And well they may to see a Man in Egypt.

Welcome! Royal Stranger!
Not only to my Court, but to my Bosom.

I heard you sent for me; but on what Business
Am yet to learn.

The greatest in the World: To see the Man,
Whom even his Foes extol; His Friends adore,
And all Mankind admire.

Say rather, Sir,
A Man forsaken of his better Stars,
A banished Prince; The shadow of a King.

My Fathers Friend.

I must not think so vainly of my self.
To be what you have said, lest it upbraid you,
To let your Fathers Friend, for three long Months,
Thus Dance attendance for a word of Audience.

Now by my Soul, it is nobly urged: He speaks
As if he were in Sparta, on his Throne;
Not asking Aid; but granting:
How little looks our Pageant Prince to him!
This is the only King I ever saw.

By all the Gods; when I have stood repulsed
Before your Gates, and could not gain admittance,
I have not Sighed so much for my own sorrows,
As I have blushed for your ungenerous Usage.

Not a word, Ptolomey!
Ashamed by all that is good to be miscalled
A King, when this is present.

Think you it is nothing
For me to beg; That I constrain my Temper
To sue for Aid, which you should first have offered.
Believe me, Ptolomey, a Noble Soul
Does much that asks: He gives you power t'oblige him.
Know, Sir, There Is a proud Modesty in merit,
Averse from begging; and resolved to pay
Ten times the Gift it asks.

I have been to blame;
And you have justly taxed my long neglect.
I am Young, and am a Lover; and how far
Fair Eyes may make even Kings forgetful. Look,
And read my best Excuse.

O Miracle! He blushes!
The first red Virtue I have ever seen
Upon that Face.

I am sorry, Sir, you have made me your Excuse*
As if I stood betwixt the Good you meant;
And intercepted every Royal Grace.
Now in my own Defense I must solicit
All his concerns as mine:
And if my Eyes have power, He should not sue
In vain, nor linger with a long delay.

Well! J'll consider.

Say that word again;
And I Will consider too.

Prithee be satisfied, He shall be aided,
Or I Will no more be King.

When were thou one? For shame, for shame ye Gods,

To do so good a Deed!

I am a Spartan, Madam, scarce of Words;
We have but just enough to speak our Meaning.
Be thanked; That Is all I could have said to Jove,
Had Jove, like you, restored me to my Crown.

The Gods have given you, Sir, the speedy means


Oh make me happy: Tell me how this Sword
(This and my Heart are all that is left me now)
Can be Employed to serve the Crown of Egypt.

Well said Father: Thou art a true Statesman.


My King has in the Camp a Younger Brother,
Valiant they say, but very Popular;
He gets too far into the Soldiers Grace;
And Inches out my Master.

Is the King
Assured of this, by any Overt Act;
Or any close Conspiracy revealed?

He has it in his power to be a Traitor;
And that is enough.

He has it in his will too:
Else why this Ostentation of his Virtues,
His Bounty, Valor, and his Temperance?
Why are they thus exposed to public View?
But as a Venus set besides a Monster,
To make an Odious Comparison;
As if his Brother wanted what he boasts?

What Is to be done with him?

There needs no more, I think, but to contrive,
With Secresy, and Safety, to Dispatch him.

I thank thee, that thou have not Cozened me

Had been too much in Conscience for thy calling.

He Dies, that is out of doubt.

Your Brother, Sir!

Why do you ask that Question?

Because I had a Brother;
(Oh grief to say I had, and have not now)
Wise, Valiant, Temperate; and in short a Spartan!
Had all the Virtues, which your Counselor
Imputed to your Brother, as his Crimes:
He Loved me well; so well, he could but die,
To show he Loved me better than his Life:
He lost it for me in Sellasia's Field;
And went the greatest Ghost of all our name,
That ever had a Brother or a King.

Wipe off the Tears, that stand upon your Eyes;
Good Nature works too far. Kings have no Brothers:
What Men call such are Rivalls of their Crowns;
Yours timed his Death, so as to Merit Grief.
Who knows, but he laid in, by that last Action,
The means to have betrayed you, had he Lived.

I would say something: but I curb my passion,
Because thou art the Father to my Friend.
To you, Sir, this; If you Condemn your Brother,
Only because he is Bounteous, Great, and Brave;
Know you Condemn those Virtues, own you want 'em.
Had you a Thousand Brothers, such as he,
You ought to show you are above 'em all;
By daring to reward, and Cherish 'em,
As Bucklers of your Crown in time of War;
And in soft Peace, the Jewels that adorn it.

I stand Corrected, Sir, he ought to Live.

I think so too.

I do not wish his Death,
However I seemed to give that rugged Counsel.


Follow the Sun, True Shadow.

I only wish my Master may be safe;
But there are Mercenaries in the Army,
Three thousand Greeks, the Flower of all our Troops,
Like Wolves indeed among Egyptian Lambs;
If these Revolt -- (I do not say they will)
But if your Brother please to take the Crown:
And be not good enough to let you Reign,
Those Greeks where ever they go, will turn the Scale.

What think you, Cleomenes?

He says true.

Then Magas must not live.

That does not follow:
Fear not those Mercenaries: They are mine;
Devoted to my Interest; Commanded by my Nod:
They are my Limbs of War, and I their Soul:
Were they in Arms against you at your Gates;
High in their Rage, and fixed upon the Spoil,
Should I say, Hold; Nay, should I only Frown,
They could not bear my Eyes, but Awed and Mastered,
Like Lions to their Keepers, would couch and fawn
And disobey their Hunger.

Wondrous Man!
How I admire thy Virtue!

And his Genius;
Some are born Kings,
Made up of three parts Fire, so full of Heaven,
It sparkles at their Eyes: Inferior Souls,
Know 'em as soon as seen, by sure instinct,
To be their Lords, and naturally Worship
The secret God within 'em.

Sir, I humbly beg
A word in private --

Madam!

You may go.

Cleanthes, follow me.

Panthaeus brought me hither to attend you,

And thou art welcome, but thou come too late.

Your Page of Honor!

The mistake is easy in such a Courts as this,
Where Princes look like Pages.

It Is my Son!

I must have leave to love you, Royal Youth;
Above all Nations I Adore a Greek,
And of all Greeks a Spartan.

What he is,
And what I am, are owing to your Favor.



No, for I would not get Egyptians.

For what, Sir, do you take us?

For what you are;
When the Gods molded up the Paste of Man,
Some of their Dough was left upon their hands,
For want of Souls: And so they made Egyptians:
They were intended for four Feet; And when
They come to run before our Noble Spartans,
They Will curse the Gods for the Two Legs they owed 'em.

Then since you will not let me be your Mistress,
Would I had been your Mother.

So would not I:
For then I had not been all Spartan.


My tender Looks; my languishing Regards,
Are like mis-aiming Arrows, lost in Air,
And miss the flying Prey.
These Eyes I Thank the Gods
Are still the same: The Diamonds are not dimmed:
Nor in their Luster: lost in Ptolomy;
Small Boast: Alas! Ptolomy has no Soul,
It Is what he wants, I love in Cleomenes;
Perhaps he dares not think I would be Loved,
Then must I make the advance; and making lose
The vast Prerogative our Sex enjoys,
Of being Courted first: Courted! To what?
To our own Wishes: There Is the point; but still,
To speak our wishes first; Forbid it, pride,
Forbid it Modesty: True; They forbid it,
But Nature does not: When we are a Thirst,
Or Hungry, Will imperious Nature stay?
Not Eat nor Drink, before it is bid, Fall on:
Well Sex, if this must be,
That I must not invite: I may at least be suffered,
To lay some kind Occasion in his way,
That if he dare but speak; He may succeed.

I durst not have presumed to interrupt
Your private Thoughts.

They wholly were employed in serving you;
But durst not, and presume, are words of Fear;
I thought they were not in your Spartan Tongue;
For my sake, banish 'em:
On what were you so earnestly employed?
You would not look this way.

A Picture, Madam.

View it again, it is worth a second Sight,
Your Son observes it still; 'Twere well to help
My Lover's Understanding;
Know you this Piece, young Prince?

Some Battle, I believe; and in that Thought,
I gaze with such Delight.

Some Rape, I guess.

That Is near the true Design, and yet mistaken;
It Is Paris bearing from your Spartan Shore,
The Beauteous Hellen; How do you approve it?

Not in the least, for it is a scurvy piece.

And yet it is known to be Apelles Hand;
The Style is his, you grant he was a Master.

It Is scurvy still, because it represents
A base dishonest Act; to violate
All Hospitable Rites, to force away,
His Benefactors Wife; Ungrateful Villain;
And so the Gods, The avenging Gods have judged.

Was he a Spartan King that suffered this?
Sure he revenged the Rape?

He did, my Boy,
And slew the Ravisher.

Look better, Sir; You Will find it was no Rape;
Mark well that Hellen in her Lovers Arms:
Can you not see, she but affects to strive;
She heaves not up her Hands to Heaven for help,
But hugs the kind Companion of her Flight.
See how her tender Fingers strain his sides;
It Is an Embrace; a Grasping of Desire;
A very Belt of Love, that Girds his Waste.
She looks as if she did not fear to fall,
But only lose her Lover if she fell:
Observe her Eyes; How slow they seem to roll
Their Wishing Looks, and Languish on his Face:
Observe the whole Design, and you would Swear,
She Ravished Paris, and not Paris, Her.

Sparta has not to Boast of such a Woman;
Nor Troy to thank her, for her ill-plac'd Love.

But Paris had; as for the War that followed,
'Twas but a Fable of a Grecian Wit,
To raise the Valor of his Countrymen:
For Menelaus was an Honest Wretch;
A Tame good Man, that never durst resent;
A mere Convenient Husband; Dull and Slavish;
By Nature meant the thing the Lovers made him.

His Goodness aggravates their Crime the more:
Had Menelaus used his Hellen ill,
Had he been Jealous, or distrusted both,
I would allow a grain or two, for Love;
And plead in their Excuse.

There was their safety that he was not Jealous:
What would you more of him? He was a Fool,
And put the happy means into their hands.

I cannot much commend my Countryman.

Indeed, my Lord, your Countryman was dull,
That did not understand so plain a Courtship.
Have Spartans Eyes for nothing? not to see
So manifest a Passion?

Yes too well.
Madam, your Goodness interests you too much
In Hellens Cause. I have no more to urge,
But that she was a Wife: That Word, a Wife,
In spite of all your Eloquence condemns her.

You argue justly; Therefore 'twas a Crime:
But had she been a Mistress, not a Wife;
Her Love had been a Virtue, to forsake
The Nauseous Bed of a Loathed fulsome King;
And fly into a sprightly Lovers Arms.
Her Love had been a Merit to her Paris,
To leave her Country, and what more her Kingdom:
With a Poor Fugitive Prince to Sail away,
And bear her Wealth along to make him happy.

You put your Picture in the fairest Light:
But both the Lovers broke their plighted Vows;
He to Oenone, She to Menelaus.

The Gods that made two Fools had done more justly
To have matched Menelaus with Oenone:
Think better of my Picture, it deserves
A Second thought; it speaks; the Hellen speaks.

It speaks Egyptian then; a base Dishonest Tongue.

You are too Young to understand her Language.
Do not thank me,
Till I have brought your business to perfection:
Doubt not my kindness; nothing shall be wanting
To make your Voyage happy.

I only fear th'Excess of your full Bounty!
To give me more then what my wants require.

Meaning, perhaps, my Person and my Love!
I would not think it so; and yet I fear,
And while I fear, his Voyage shall be hindered:
No breath of Wind
Can stir, to waft him hence, unless I please:
I am the Goddess that commands the Seas.
In Vain he Vows at any other Shrine,
My Heart is in his Hands; his Fate's in mine.

I Must confess 'twas Obvious.


He said he could Command 'em with his Nod:
Can he do this with Mercenaries, raised
Not at his Charge, but yours? by you maintained:
What could he more, had they been Spartans born?

What would you hence infer?

What you observed?
Some are born Kings; and so is Cleomenes.

A great Soul dares not call himself a Villain:
He has that Interest, and will use it nobly;
To serve, and not to ruin his Protector,

Is Aegypt's safety, and the Kings, and Yours,
Fit to be trusted on a bare suppose,
That he is Honest? Honest, let him be;
But on his own Experiment, not ours!
Man is but Man; Unconstant still, and Various;
There Is no to Morrow in him, like to Day.
Perhaps the Atoms rolling in his Brain,
Make him think Honestly this present Hour;
The next a Swarm of Base, Ungrateful Thoughts
May mount aloft: And where is our Egypt then?
Who would trust Chance? since all Men have the Seeds
Of Good and Ill, which should work upward first.

All men! then you are one; and by that Rule,
Your wicked Atoms may be working now
To give bad Council; That you still may Govern.

I would the King would Govern.

Because you think I have too much Command.

Would you would rule me both by turns, in quiet,
And let me take my Ease!

Then my turns first.

Our Masters Safety in sound reason ought
To be preferred to both.

So thinks Cassandra too.

No; Court Sosybius, and cast Cassandra off.

What have I said, or done,
To merit this unkindness?
Tell me but what you think of Cleomenes,
And be my Oracle.

I know him Grateful.

To know him grateful, is enough for Jove.

And therefore not too much for me in Egypt:
I say, I know him Honest.

Then I know it.
Now may Sosybius speak?

He may: but not to contradict my knowledge.

Then I concur, to let him go for Greece;
And wish our Egypt fairly rid of him.
For, as our Apis, though in Temples fed,
And under Golden Roofs, yet loathes his food,
Because restrained; and longs to roam in Meads,
Among the Milky-Mothers of the Herd.
So, Cleomenes, kept by force in Egypt,
Is sullen at our Feasts; abhors our Dainties;
And longs to change 'em for his Spartan Broth.
He may be dangerous here; Then send him hence,
With aid enough to Conquer all he lost,
And make him formidable to Mankind.

He may be formidable then to us,
That thou would say.

No: for you know him grateful.

Would thou would learn to speak without a double,
Thou Delphian Statesman.

Would I could know your Wishes that I might:
I would but smooth their way and make em 'easy!

Good Old Man!
A little over Zealous, but well-meaning.
My Wishes are the honor of my King.
That Ptolomy may keep his Royal word*
And I my promise to procure this Aid;
If to be Mistress, signifies Command,
Let this be done: If not, the King may find,
Another Beauty, worthier of his Bed;
And I another Lover, less ungrateful:

Let Egypt sink before that fatal day;
No, we are one: Cassandra, we are one:
Or I am nothing? Thou art Ptolomy.

Now you deserve to be the first of Kings,
Because you rank your self the first of Lovers:
What can I do to show Cassandra grateful?
Nothing but this;
To be so nice in my Concerns for you:
To doubt where Doubts are not: To be too fearful:
To raise a Bugbear Shadow of a Danger,
And then be frighted, though it cannot reach you.

Be pleased to name your apprehensions, Madam.

Plain Souls like mine, judge others by themselves:
Therefore I hold our Cleomenes honest:
But since it is possible: Though barely so,
That he may prove ungrateful,
I would have pledges given us of his Faith,
His Wife, his Mother, and his Son, be left
As Hostages in Egypt.

Admirable:
Some God inspired you with this prudent Council.

I thought so too, but that I durst not speak.

Leave me to manage this.

My best Sosybius!
But do it surely, by the easiest means,
Infuse it gently: Do not pour it down;
Let him not think he stands suspected here;
And least of all, by Me!

He shall not, Madam.
Now Sir, the Illumination-Feast attends you:
For Apis has appeared,

Why then I must be formal,
Go to the Temple.
Come my fair Cassandra,
That I may have an Object worth my Worship.

The God that I Adore is in my Breast;
This is the Tomple: This is the Sacrifice:
But to the Powers Divine we make Appeal,
with great Devotion; and with little Zeal.

Yes yes, it shall be done; but not her way:
Call in my Son Cleanthes: This Cassandra
Is our enchanting Siren: She that Sings
Our Ptolomy into secure Destruction:
In vain I Counsel him to avoid his Ruin:
These Women-Charmers, Oh they have a Devil
Too strong to dispossess. Call in my Son.
Cleanthes! Are you Cleomenes's Friend,
Or only seem you such?

To seem to be, and not to be what I seem,
Are things my honest Nature understands not.

But you must love your King and Country more.

Yes, when I have a King and Country
That can deserve my Love!
Egypt, as Egypt is, deserves it not:
A People, baser than the Beasts they worship:
Below their Pot-herb-gods that grow in Gardens:
The King --

Go to; Young Man, what ever he be,
I must not hear my Master vilify'd.

Why did you name him then? Were I at Prayers,
And even for you, whom as my Soul I love,
If Ptolomy should come a Cross my Thoughts,
A Curse would follow where I meant a Blessing.

It Is well, it is well, I am so fond a Father;
Those words were death in any other Mouth;
I know too much of you, you love the Spartan,
Beyond your King and Country*

It Is a Truth;
So Noble; I would own it to the Gods,
And they be proud to hear it,

Confess you love him better than your Father.

No; but I love him equal with my Father.

Say better, and say true:
If we were opposite, and one must fall,
Whom would thou Save?

Neither; For both would dye:
Before I could resolve.

If I command thee,
To break thy Friendship with him? Would thou?

No:

Why then thou have confessed, thou love him more.

Not so: For should he bid me disobey,
Or not love you: Thus, would I answer him,
As I have answered you.

Ungrateful Boy!

You bid me tell you true, and this is my reward.

Go from my Sight.

I will; but would not go
Without your Blessing.

O, so well I love thee,
That I could Curse thee for not loving me:
Stay, I would send thee on a Message to him,
But that I fear thy Faith.

You wrong my Piety.

It much concerns my Interest, which is thine;
Would thou deliver what I have to say?
Would thou induce his Reason to comply?

Both; Granting your Proposals Honorable*
If not, employ some Mercenary Tongue,
The Court affords you store: And spare my Virtue!

I would have Cleomenes sent away,
With Royal Aid.

You promised him he should.

And would have thee persuade him to this Voyage.

A welcome Errand: Oh my dear, dear Father.

But on my terms, mark that; my terms; Cleanthes.

I feared the Statesman in you.

I would have Egypt safe: That Is all my Interest;
And therefore he must leave behind for Pawns,
His Mother, Wife and Son.

It Is clogging of a Gift: It Is base, mean Council;
I hope you gave it not.

No: 'Twas Cassandra!
But she would have that Odium cast on me,
I am her Beast of Burden and must bear it.

I never can belie so good a Father!
But this I Will do:
The Message shall be faithfully delivered,
And all the Strumpet stand exposed to shame.

Thou hitst my meaning; but he must be secret;
Must seem to take the Favor as from Her:
And lay the hardship of the Terms on me.

He shall.

And thou will Gild this bitter Pill:
For there is no other way to go from hence,
But leaving these behind.

A Beam of Thought comes glancing on my Soul.
I Will undertake it
The Pledges shall be left.

My best Cleanthes:
But haste, and lose no time!

I am all on fire to serve my Friend and Father.

Cleomenes ought to be dispatched:
Dispatched the safest way: He ought to dye;
Not, that I hate his Virtue; but I fear it:
The Mistress drives my Councils to the Leeward;
Now I must edge upon a point of Wind;
And make slow way, recovering more and more,
Till I can bring my Vessel safe ashore*

Soul of the Universe, and source of Life,
Immortal Apis, thou thrice Holy Fire,
Hear Aegypt's Vows and mine: if as we dream,
Egyptian Earth Impregnated with Flame,
Sprung the first man;
Preserve thy Primitive Plantation here.
Then for my self, thy Type, and thy Vicegerent,
Roll from my Loins a long Descent of Kings:
Mixed of Cassandra's kindly blood and mine.
Mine be she only, and I only hers.
And when I shall resolve again to thee,
May she survive me, and be Queen of Egypt:
Hear this, and firm it with some happy Omen.

Apis be praised for this Auspicious Omen.


Through humane Hearts, art every where Adored;
Accept these Vows, in show to Apis paid,
And make his Altar thine: Hear not that wretch!
Because his Prayers were not addressed to thee;
Or only hear his last: that I may reign.
Make Cleomenes mine, and mine alone:
Give us a flight secure, a safe arrival;
And Crown our Wishes in each others Arms.
Hear this and firm it with some happy Omen.

Avert this Omen, Apis.


Accursed thy Temple! more accursed thy Priests!
The Gods are theirs, not ours; and when we pray
For happy Omens, We their price must pay:
In vain at Shrines, th'ungiving suppliant stands;
This it is to make a Vow with Empty hands:
Fat Offerings are the Priesthoods only care;
They take the Money, and Heaven hears the Prayer.
Without a Bribe their Oracles are mute,
And their Instructed Gods refuse the suit.

The Propositions are unjust and hard;
And if I swallow 'em, It Is as we take
The Wrath of Heaven.
We must have patience, for they will be Gods,
And give us no account of what we suffer.

My Father much abhors this middle way,
Betwixt a Gift and Sale of Courtesy:
But it is the Mistress; She that seemed so kind,
It Is she, that bears so hard a hand upon you:
She that would half Oblige, and half Affront.

Let her be what she is: That Is Curse enough.
But such a Wife, a Mother, and a Son!
Oh sure, ye Gods! when ye made this vile Egypt:
Ye little thought, they should be Mortgaged here!
My only Comfort
Is, that I trust these precious Pawns with thee:
For thou art so religiously a Friend,
That I would sooner leave 'em in thy hands,
Than if I had security from Heaven,
And all the Gods to answer for their safety.

Yes, yes; They shall be safe;
And thou shall have a pledge,
As strong as Friendship can make over to thee:
Deny me not, for I must go with thee,
And share what Fate allots for thee in Greece.
Nay cast not on me that forbidding frown;
But let me be their pawn, as they are thine:
So I shall have thee wholly to my self.
And be thy Wife, thy Mother, and thy Son,
As thou art all to me.

Oh Friend!

What would thou say, my better part?

No more, but this; That thou art too unkind,
When even in kindness thou would overcome.

Let me be proud; and pardon thou my Pride;
Base, Worthless Egypt has no other Pawn,
To Counter-ballance these but only me.
'Twas on such terms alone, I durst propose it:
Shall thou leave these?
And I not leave a Father, whom I love?
Come, come; It must be so.
We'll give each other all we have besides;
And then we shall be even. Here they are!
I leave thee. Break those tender Ties of Nature,
As gently as thou can; they must be broken.
But when thou see Cassandra, curb thy Spleen;
Seem to receive the kindness as from her:
And if thou think I love thee, for my sake,
Remembering me; strive to forget my Father.

But how can I sustain to tell 'em this,
Even in the gentlest Terms.
There are not words in any Tongue so soft
As I would use: The Gods must make a new one,
If they would have me speak.

How King of Sparta! When your Fortune smiles,
A Glorious Sunshine, and a Gloomy Soul.
The Gods love chearfullness, when they are kind;
They think their Gifts despised, and thrown away
On sullen thankless Hearts.

I hear my dearest Lord that we shall go.

Go!

What a mournful Echo makes my Father!
By Mars, he stifles Go upon his Tongue;
And kills the joyful sound, he speaks so low,
That Heaven must Listen if it hear his thanks.

Yes, I shall go; but how?

With Aegypt's aid.

With his own Soul and Sword, a Thousand strong;
And worth ten Aegypts, and their ten Thousand Gods.

There Is something more in this, than what we guess!
Some Secret anguish rowls within his Breast,
That shakes him like an Earthquake, which he presses,
And will not give it vent. I know him well,
He Blushes, and would speak, and wants a Voice!
And stares and Gapes like a forbidden Ghost,
Till he be spoke to first. -- Tell me my Son!

Mother, I will, -- And yet I cannot neither.
Mother! that word has struck me dumb again:
For, how can I say Mother, and propound
To leave her here behind, who gave me Life?
Mother! and Wife! and Son! the names that Nature
Most Loves to speak, are banished from my Mouth.

Tell us, My Love, the King has changed his mind,
And has refused us leave; for we can bear it:
Egypt is Greece to me, while you are here.

Oh I would speak! But, Oh! you speak so kindly,
That you forbid my Speech: You call me, Love.

Was that too kind a Word?

It was to me; I am a mere Barbarian;
A Brute, a stock, for I have no Relations,
Or shortly shall have none.

Then we must die!

We must: and welcome Death.

To save his Life.

The Gods forbid that you should dye for me!
No: You may live; but I must dye thrice over:
For I must leave you here, or must not go:
These are the hard Conditions offered me.

Then Egypt would have Pledges: Is this all?

Yes, and a mighty All: It Is all I have:
But I propose it not; Remember that.

I do: and therefore I propose it first,
To save this virtuous Shame, this good Confusion,
That would not let you speak.

Oh! I could almost think you love me not:
You Granted me so quick, so willingly:
What I -- bear witness Heaven, was slow to ask.
And would be loath to have.

I cannot leave you.

I was but wishing, thou would draw me back,
And now I cannot go.

Are you turned Woman?
No more of this fond Stuff;

Shall I be left to gather Rust in Egypt?
A Glue of Sloth to stick to my young Pinions;
And mar their flight; Habitual Cowardice:
No; I must learn my stubborn Trade of War,
From you alone, and envy you betimes.

But the Conditions! Oh these hard Conditions,
That such a Spirit must be left behind,
Untaught! unfashion'd by a Fathers hands!
A Spirit fit to start into an Empire,
And look the World to Law.

No more debating, for I see the pinch,
He must be left, and so must She and I:
For we are but your softnesses, My Son:
The Encumbrances and Luggage of the War:
Fight for us, and redeem us, if you please;
For there we are your clogs of Virtue: Here,
The Spurs of your return.

I Thank you, Mother,
Once more you have Erected me to Man,
And set me upright with my Face to Heaven!
The Woman and the Boy, be yours awhile:
The War be mine alone!

There spoke the Spartan King: Think not on us.

I wonnot.

Not in Prayers!

In Prayers! That Is poor,
As if the Gods were Thoughtless of their work;
Think on us, when you fight: and when you make
A lusty stroke, Cry out, That Is for my Boy.

Dispose this mouldring Carcass as you please,
E're lingering Age or Sickness wear it out;
Unprofitable then for Sparta's good:
Be cheerful, fight it well, and all the rest,
Leave to the Gods and Fortune.

If they fail me,
Theirs be the Fault, For Fate is theirs alone:
My Virtue, Fame, and Honor are my own.

SO so; it works: now Mistress sit you fast --

Humh, Whores and Catamites!
Were those his words?

Upon my life they were.

Whom should he mean by those unmanner'd terms;

Can you guess?

'Twas kindly asked.

A foul mouthed Villain.

So, I should have thought,
But that this Lady knows him good and grateful.

Madam! I stand suspected without cause,
And, but I fear Revenge from this great Man,
I could say more.

I thought he was concerned.

Who: I?

Speak boldly, Grecian, I protect thee.

Cleanthes then was present, and he added.
But he appears in time to hear his Charge.

My dear! dear! Son!
I fear thy lavish Tongue has ruined Thee;
What can I do to save Thee?

Well, proceed.

Can you deny, my Lord? that you were present,
When Cleomenes Taxed the Court, and King
With Brutal Vices?

I remember somewhat,
Of certain Horses which he could not buy,
And saw thee go away dissatify'd,
Which to prevent, I meant to purchase 'em;
The rest I heard not, nor believe he spoke.

Cleanthes added farther; That thou said,

And we would know: E're Tortures force it from thee.



He added farther.

No; thou add'st it all:
And I demand the Combat.

Let him speak.

Think first, Cleanthes! Think before you hazard,
Your Life and Honor in this bold Appeal,
Somewhat, you might have said, nay more you ought,
Since I commanded you to be a Spy
On Cleomenes Acts, and close Designs.

The good old Liar would preserve my Life
And I must steer his course,
I think -- I farther added

It Is forgiven:
So wholly pardoned, that I will not hear it;
Good Spies are useful, and must be encouraged;
But what must next be done with Cleomenes?

Dispatch him, as the source of all your fears;
Observe the Mounting Billows of the Main,
Blown by the Winds into a raging Storm:
Brush off those Winds, and the high waves return,
Into their quiet first created Calm:
Such is the rage of busy blustering Crowds:
Fomented by the Ambition of the great:
Cut off the Causes and the Effect will cease;
And all the moving madness fall to Peace.

Let him seized in order to his Death;
I am in haste, you know it, for my progress,
A thousand pleasures wait me at Canopus;
And this poor trifling business of one life,
Encumbers all: Cassandra! Are you ready?
We will be seen like Isis and Osyris,
Drawn in one Chariot for admiring Eyes,
To worship as we pass.

A word in private: Coenus, attend without.


The Life I gave you, which your Folly hazarded:
Break off all Friendship with that Spartan King,
Or never see me more: His Fate's resolved:
Nor can you stem the Tide: Avoid his ruins;
Reply not, but obey.

I know my Duty.

Thou overjoy'st me: Follow, we'll talk, farther.

What think you of Sosybius and his Son?

As of two Creatures zealous of my Service.

Oh Heavens! That I should love this King so well!
But that I dote: What can I see in him?
But dull good Nature and Simplicity!
Well, well! My little Dear, I find the Gods
Have given me here, no business of my own;
But made me just your Drudge to Love and save you.

'Protest I thought 'em honest; are they not?

Ye Gods! why did you make this Man your Image?
And made him but an Image: You Will forgive me?
I Love you so, that I am forced to rail.
You saw no close Conveyance of the Game
Betwixt the Crafty Sire, and Cunning Son.
How slily one invented an Excuse,
And the other took it up as dext'rously?

Why sure Cleanthes was his Fathers Spy.

Yes, over you; but not on Cleomenes.
I fear you are betrayed, and the Gods blind you,
To make your ruin sure!

As how, Cassandra?

When you are absent --

Well!

It Is in their Power --

To Murder Cleomenes --

If they please;
Or else to set him free, and join with Magas.

I will not to Canopus.

Yes; You must.

But how shall I be safe, and take this Journey?

Leave that to me.

But you must go along.

No: I must stay here, in order to your safety,
To watch the growth of danger and prevent it.
This Cruel absence I must undergo;
Or else I Love you not.

Since I must go;
I Will cheat 'em of a Day, and come before
My time, for Love of thee.

To sum up all,
For we are both in haste;
Entrust your Royal Signet in my Hands.

Joined with Sosybius.

Would you trust a Statesman
Before your own dear Heart. You love him better*
You naughty Man, in faith you do; and now I think on it,
I will not have your Signet: By this Kiss,
And this, and this, I will not.

By all three, thou shall.
But kill this Cleomenes quickly, he is dangerous.

He Is in safe hands with me.

One more Embrace.

There, take it, and now go:
Thus for your good, I thrust you from my Arms.

Farewell, My Love.

Farewell. -- I hope for ever.
Now Cleomenes I will sound thy Soul:
For Life and Death depend upon thy Choice.
But for that easy Wretch, him I contemn.
Hard state of Lovers! Subject to our Laws!
Fools we must have, or else we cannot sway;
For none but Fools will Womankind Obey.
If they prove stubborn and resist our Will,
We Exercise our Power, and use 'em ill.
The passive Slave that Whines, Adores and Dies,
Sometimes we pity: But we still despise.
But when we dote, the self same Fate we prove,
Fools at the best: But double Fools in Love.
We rage at first with ill dissembled scorn;
Then falling from our height, more basely mourn;
And Man, the insulting Tyrant takes his turn.
Leaves us to Weep for our neglected Charms,
And hugs another Mistress in his Arms:
And that which humbles our proud Sex the most;
Of all our slighted favors makes his boast.

Her Words, Her every Look, confess she loves me,
And therefore she detains these Hostages:
As pawns of my return to her and Egypt.
Thus far it is plain and obvious: But the Picture.
That Hellen. There Is the Riddle of her Love.
For what I see, or only think I see,
Is like a Glimps of Moonshine, streaked with red;
A shuffled, sullen, and uncertain Light,
That Dances through the Clouds, and shuts again;
Than 'ware a rising Tempest on the Main.


The shame that should to Womankind belong,
Flown from my Bosom, hovers on my Tongue.

It Is rarely seen, that Gods from Heaven descend;
But for some kind, some Charitable end.
And yet your troubled looks ill News import,
Stops, or Delays; but that is no News at Court:
There Is somewhat which your pity would disguise.

Would you could read that somewhat in my Eyes.
But as you are a Spartan and a King,
Undaunted hear whatever News I bring:
The Favorite hates you; Coenus has betrayed
The bitter truths, that our loose Court upbraid.
Your Friend was set upon you for a Spy;
And on his Witness, you are doomed to die.

I have been plunged already twice in Woes,
And the third time above the Waves I rose.
Still I have strength to Steer me into Port,
And shun the Secret Quicksands of the Court.
But when my Friend, who should expecting stand,
On the bare Beach, to lend his helping hand;
When He defends the Unhospitable shore,
And drives me thence, I sink for ever more.
But it is impossible; his Faith is tried;
The Man, who had defamed him thus; had ly'd.

Well! I forgive your blunt Laconique way,
It shall be seen, it shall, this very Day,
Who would preserve your Life, and who betray.
The King incensed; the Favorite your Foe,
Yet on the same Conditions you may go:
Your Wife, your Son, your Mother left behind.
What think you now?

It Is to be wondrous kind.

Suppose I add a farther bounty yet.

It could but make your Favors over weight.

What if I went my self to waft you over?
And left you, when I saw you safe a shore?
For I should leave you, if you thought it fit,
Not to do more than Honor would permit.
Can I do less to show you I am kind,
To Comfort you for those you left behind?

The World would think you kinder than you ought.

Why should I care what base Egyptians thought?

Immoderate Gifts oppress me, not relieve;
Nor dare I take, what ruins you to give.

Leave me to judge of that. I could prescribe
An easy way of giving back my Bribe.
Why would you force me farther than my part;
Look on my Eyes; and you may read my Heart.
Oh there you met me with a guilty Glance!
Now it is too late to plead your Ignorance.

I am so much below, and you above.
What can I say?

But one kind word. I Love.

As far as Gratitude that Love can pay.

Oh stop not there; for that is but half the way:
Would you to one poor narrow word confine
Your passion? When I put no bounds to mine.

Cleora!

Now you speak too soon; Forbear.
Nothing can please me, that begins with her.

I must begin where Nature void of Art,
Directs my Tongue, with her who rules my Heart.

Let us together sail before the Wind,
And leave that dull Domestique Drudge behind.

What? to expose her helpless Innocence,
To the wild fury of an Injured Prince?

A vain surmise; their Talents would agree,
The Gods have made your Noble Mind for me:
And her insipid Soul for Ptolomey:
A heavy lump of Earth without desire,
A heap of Ashes that o're-lays your Fire.

Virtue, you must allow her, though a Foe.

No more, than what I would to Ice and Snow;
Yet those have Seeds of heat; her shivering Blood,
Makes her at best but impotently good.
But neither I can save you, if you stay,
Nor save my self unless I go away:
For if I stay behind, and set you free,
The Fury of the King would fall on me.

Then to prevent your Fate I must not go,
Death is my choice, since Heaven will have it so.

Heaven would preserve your Life, and so would I,
But you are obstinately bent to dye,

Some Men are made of such a leaky Mould*
That their filled Vessels can no Fortune hold:
Poured in, it sinks away, and leaves 'em dry,
Of that unsusceptible Make am I:
Yet think not, Fair one, I your Charms despise,
My Heart's insensible, but not my Eyes.
Respect and Gratitude are all my store,
And those I give: My Love was given before*

Thus break false Merchants with an honest show:
Rich to themselves, but Bankrupts where they owe.

If at this awful distance I remain,
Better be too Devout, than too profane.

Flattery! Such Alms, the Priesthood gives the poor,
They Bless, and send 'em empty from the Door:
Know you, that Death stands ready at the Gate;
That I forbid him, and suspend your Fate;
The King's short absence leaves me absolute;
When he returns th'inevitable ill,
Is past my power, and may be past my Will:
Unhappy Man! prevent thy Destiny;
Speak one kind word to save thy Life and me.

Be answered, and expect no more Reply.

Disdain has swelled him up, and choked his Breath:
Sullen and Dumb, and obstinate to Death:
No signs of pity in his Face appear;
Look! If the ungrateful Creature shed one Tear!
Crammed with his Pride, he leaves no room within
For Sighs to issue out, or Love to enter in.
What! do thou turn thy Face in my despite?
Am I a Toad? a Monster to thy Sight?
Farewell fond pity then: As thou from me,
So, thy good Fortune turns her Face from Thee?
Left, scorned, and loathed, and all without Relief,
Revenge succeeds to Love, and Rage to Grief:
Tempests and Whirlwinds through my Bosom move,
Heave up, and madly mount my Soul above
The reach of Pity, or the bounds of Love.
Approach and seize the Traitor

Now I can speak; thy kindness kept me dumb:
For that I could not answer: The false Siren,
No longer hiding her uncomely parts,
Struts on the Waves, and shows the Brute below.

Stop that foul Mouth: Behold this Royal Signet;
The Warrant of his Death.

Stand back ye Slaves,
And put me not to stain a Spartan Sword:
With base Egyptian Blood.

Fall on, behold a Noble Beast at Bay:
And the vile Huntsmen shrink -- More Aid: Who waits?
Now Sir, What brings you here?

My Zeal to serve you.

That shall be tried; Disarm him*

Cleomenes!
Deliver me your Sword.

How Is this, Cleanthes?

It must be so!

Is this a Friends Advice,
To give me up defenseless to a Crowd,
Whom Armed I could resist?

Must he dye, Madam!
Or be reserved for further punishment,
At Ptolomey's return?

Why ask you that?

Because his Destiny, for ought I find
Depends on you: Think first, and then Command.

Know then, that his last Third is on the Distaff,
And I can cut it now.

And are resolved?

I only said I can, and I can Save,
Disarm, and hurt him not.

Once more your Sword.

Send off those Villains: Though I fear 'em not;
Yet Cowards are offensive to my sight:
Nor shall they see me do an Act that looks
Below the Courage of a Spartan King.

Cleanthes! May I trust your Faith?

You may.

Begone, and wait my Call.

Cleanthes! Still my Friend; for such I hold thee
Though this bad Woman says thou art my Spy;
I cannot give a greater proof than this,
That I believe her not:
If thou art false,
It Is in thy power to show it safely, now:
And compass that by Treason, which in Arms
Nor Thou, nor any Man alive can force.
Remember still, I gave it to a Friend:
For Life and Death are equal in themselves;
That which would cast the Balance, is thy falsehood,
To make my Death more wretched.

Then you may think me that, which you call False*
But Duty to my Father --

Say no more!
I would not curse thee, for thou were my Friend.
I think thee still as honest as thou could;
Impenetrably good; but like Achilles,
Thou had a soft Egyptian Heel undipt,
And that has made thee Mortal.

Cleanthes, Thou have well approved thy Faith:
And as this Palace is thy Government,
On utmost peril of thy Life secure him.
One farther word --

So guilty as thou art, and can thou look
On him, thou have betrayed? Go, take thy hire,
Which thou have dearly purchased, and be great

For you, brave Sir, as you have given my hopes
But Air to feed on; Air shall be your Food:
No Bread shall enter these forbidden Doors.
Thin, hungry Diet, I confess; but still
The liker Spartan Fare: Keen Appetites,
And quick Digestion wait on you and yours.

O mix not Innocence and Guilt together:
What Love have they refused, or how offended?
Be Just, though you are Cruel, or be Kind,
And punish me alone.

There Nature works,
Then there I Will stab thee in thy tender part.

What dismal Cries are those?

Nothing, a trifling sum of Misery,
New added to the foot of thy Account:
Thy Wife is seized by Force and born away;
Farewell, I dare not trust thy Vengeance further.

Cleora -- There stands Death, but no Cleora;
I would find both together.

Oh King of Sparta!

Peace, Mother, Peace.
I have had news from Hell before you.
Cleora's gone to Death. Is there a Door,
A Casement, or a Rift within these Walls?
That can let loose my Body to her rescue?

All closed, nothing but Heaven above is open.

Nay, that is closed too: The Gods are deaf to Prayers!
Hush then; the irrevocable Doom's gone forth,
And Prayers lagg after, but can never o'er-take,
Let us talk forward of our woes to come.

Cleanthes! (Oh could you suspect his Faith?)
'Twas he, that headed those, who forced her hence.

Pantheus bleeds!

A scratch, a feeble Dart,
At distance thrown by an Egyptian hand.

You heard me not, Cleanthes is --

He was -- no more good Mother,
He tore a piece of me away, and still
The void place aches within me: O my Boy,
I have bad news to tell thee.

None so bad,
As that I am a Boy: Cleanthes scorned me,
And when I drove a Thrust, home as I could,
To reach his Traitor Heart, He put it by,
And cried as in derision, Spare the Stripling;
Oh that insulting word: I would have swopp'd
Youth for old Age, and all my Life behind,
To have been then a momentary Man.

Alas! Thy Manhood, like a forward Spring,
Before it comes to bear the promised Fruit
Is blighted in the Bud: Never, my Boy,
Can thou fetch Manhood up, with thy short steps,
While with long strides the Giant stalks before thee.

Am I to dye before I am a Man?

Yes, thou must dye with me, and I with her
Who gave me life: and our poor Infant too within,
Must dye before it knows what dying means.
Three different Dates of Nature one would think;
But Fate has crammed us all into one Lease;
And that even now expiring.

Yet we live.

No, even now we dye; Death is within us,
And keeps out Life, for nourishent is Life,
And we have fed our last; Hunger feeds Death.

A lingering Doom, but four days hence the same;
And we can shorten those, turn Days to Hours,
And Hours to Moments: Death is in our Call.

The sooner then the better.

So say I.

While we have spirits left to meet him boldly.

I Will hold my Breath,
And keep my Soul a prisoner in my Body;
There let it creep and wander in the dark,
Till tired to find no outlet, it Retreats
Into my Spartan Heart, and there lies pleased:
So, we two are provided. Sir, your choice?

Not this dispatch, for we may dye at leisure.
This Famine has a sharp and meager Face:
It Is Death in an undress of Skin and Bone:
Where Age and Youth, their Landmark taken away,
Look all one common furrow.

Yet you choose it,
To please our Foes, that when they view our Skeletons,
And find 'em all alike, they may cry out,
Look how these dull obedient Spartans died,
Just as we wished, as we prescribed their Death;
And durst not take a nobler, nearer way.

Not so, but that we durst not tempt the Gods,
To break their Images without their leave.
The moment ever Cassandra came, I had
A Note without a Name, the Hand unknown,
That bad me not despair, but still hope well.
Then dye not yet;
For Heaven has means to free us; if not me,
Yet these and you: I am the hunted Stag,
Whose Life may may ransom yours.

No more of that:
I find your distant drift to die alone:
An unkind Accusation of us all,
As if we durst not die: I Will not survive you!

Nor I.

Nor I.

But hear my Reasons!
Ha! What Shadow's this! This that can glide through Walls!
Or pass its subtle Limbs through Bolts and Bars!
Black too! like what it represents, our Fate.

Too true a Shadow I, and you the Substance.

Cleora!

Thus let me grow again to thee,
Too close for Fate to sever.!
Or let Death find me in these dear, dear Arms,
And looking on thee, spare my better part,
And take me willing hence.

What! are you dreaming, Son! with Eyes cast upwards
Like a mad Prophet in an Ecstasie?

Musing on what we saw.
Just such is Death,
With a black Veil, covering a beauteous Face!
Feared afar off
By erring Nature: a mistaken Phantom:
A harmless, lambent Fire. She kisses Cold;
But kind, and soft, and sweet, as my Cleora.
Oh could we know,
What Joys she brings; at least, what rest from Grief!
How should we press into her Friendly Arms,
And be pleased not to be, or to be happy?

Look! What we have forgot! The Joy to see
Cleora here, has kept us from enquiring,
By what strange means she entered.

Small Joy, Heaven knows, to be adopted here,
Into the meager Family of Famine!
The House of Hunger: therefore asked I not;
So am I pleased to have her Company,
And so displeased to have it but in Death --

I know not how or why, my surly Jailer,
Hard as his Irons, and insolent as Power,
When put in vulgar Hands, Cleanthes gone,
Put off the Brute; and with a gloomy Smile,
(That showed a sullen loathness to be kind,)
Skreen'd me within this Veil, then led me forth;
And using to the Guards Cassandra's Name:
Made that my Passport: Every Door slew open,
TO admit my Entrance; and then clapped behind me,
To bar my going back.

Some new Resolve!
Cassandra plots, and then refines on Malice:
Plays with Revenge: with Rage she snatched you hence,
And renders you with Scorn: I thought to show you
How easy 'twas to die, by my Example,
And hansel Fate before you: But thy presence
Has changed my Mind, to drag this lingering life,
To share thy Sorrows, and assist thy Weakness.
Come in, my Friends, and let us practice Death,
Stroke the grim Lion, till he grow familiar.
Cleora! Thou and I, as Lovers should,
Will hand in hand to the dark Mansions go,
Where Life no more can cheat us into Woe;
That sucking in each others latest Breath,
We may transfuse our Souls, and put the change on Death.

ANd what
Have you determined?

He shall die.

A wholesome Resolution: Have you fixed
The Time?

He daily dies, by Hours and Moments:
All vital Nourishment but Air is wanting!
Three rising Days and two descending Nights
Have changed the Face of Heaven and Earth by turns;
But brought no kind Vicissitude to him:
His State is still the same: With hunger pinched:
Waiting the slow approaches of his Death;
Which halting on-wards, as his life goes back,
Still gains upon his Ground!

But ever Fate reach him,
The Mercy of the King may interpose:
You have the Signet?

Yes! In your Despite!

Be not displeased suppose he should escape?

Suppose he should have Wings? Impossible.

Yet, Keepers have been bribed: To whom can Ptolomy
Impute that Crime, but you?

He may: But let him if he dares:
Come, Statesman! Do not shuffle in your pace;
You would expose me to the People's Hatred,
By hurrying on this Act of Violence:
You know a little thing provokes the Crowd
Against a Mistress: She Is the Public Mark:
Therefore content your self I will be safe:
Nor shall the Prisoner die a speedier Death,
Than what my Doom decreed: Unless the King
Reverse his Orders, by my Messenger.

May I presume to ask you, whom you sent?

Thy Son, unknown to thee; for so I charged him:
And this the promised hour of his Return. -- Nay wonder not,
I chose him with design: That whatsoever
The King ordains, you both should share the Event:
And stand or fall with me. Ponder on that, and leave me!



Now tell me, Heart: Now answer for thy self:
What will thou do! and what do thou desire!
His Life? No, he is ungrateful: Or, his Death?
I tremble at that Word. What then? His Love!
His Love! my Heart! What! by Restraint, and Famine?
Are these the means to compass thy Design?
Revenge! My Hands so soft, his Heart so hard,
The blow recoils, and hurts me while I strike!
Like the mad Viper, scourged into a Rage,
I shoot into my self my fatal Sting.

The Ship is ready, when you please to sail,
And waits but your Command: The Wind stands fair.

Be secret, and attend my farther pleasure --
So; this was time well managed: In three Days
To hire a Vessel -- Put my Wealth on board:
Send off the observing Son, and Fool the Father:
See him I will, to sound his last Resolves,
If Love can soften him, or Fear can bow.
If both should fail, the ungrateful Wretch shall find,
Rage has no Bounds in slighted Womankind.

NO Food: And this the third arising Sun:
But what have I to do with telling Suns,
And measuring Time? That runs no more for me!
Yet sure the Gods are good: I would think so,
If they would give me leave;
But Virtue in Distress, and Vice in Triumph
Make Atheists of Mankind.
What Comfort, Mother?

A Soul, not conscious to it self of Ill,
Undaunted Courage, and a Master-mind:
No Comfort else but Death,
Who like a lazy Master stands aloof,
And leaves his Work to the slow hands of Famine.

All I would ask of Heaven,
Is, but to die alone; a single Ruin;
But to die over and over, in each of you,
With my own hunger pinched, but pierced with yours!

Grieve not for me!

What! not for you, my Mother!
I am strangely tempted to blaspheme the Gods;
For giving me so good, so kind a Parent:
And this is my return, to cause her Death --

Peace! Your Misfortunes cause it, not your Fault.

What! my Cleora?
I stretched my bounds as far as I could go,
To shun the sight of what I cannot help;
A Flower withering on the Stalk for want
Of nourishment from Earth and showers from Heaven:
All I can give thee is but Rain of Eyes --

Alas! I have not wherewithal to weep:
My eyes grow dim, and stiffen'd up with drought,
Can hardly roll and walk their feeble round:
Indeed -- I am faint.

And so am I. -- Heaven knows! However
In pity of 'em both, I keep it secret:
Nor shall he see me fall --

How does our helpless Infant?

It wants the Breast, its kindly nourishment:
And I have none to give, From these dry Cesterns
Which unsupply'd themselves, can yield no more:
It pulled and pulled but now, but nothing came.
At last it drew so hard, that the blood followed:
And that Red Milk I found upon its Lips,
Which made me swoon with fear.

Go in and rest thee,
And hush the Child asleep.
Look down ye Gods --
Look, Hercules, thou Author of my Race,
And Jog thy Father Jove, that he may look
On his neglected Work of Humane-kind:
Tell him -- I do not Curse him: But Devotion
Will cool in after times, if none but good Men suffer. --
What! another increase of Grief?

O Father!

Why do thou call me by so kind a name?
(...)! That implies presiding Care,
(...) to give. -- Willing himself to want!
(...) thy needs require!

A little Food!
Have you none, Father? One poor Hungry Morsel:
Or give me leave to die -- as I desired;
For without your consent, Heaven knows, I dare not.

I prithee stay a little: I am loath
To say hard things of Heaven!

But what if Heaven
Will do hard things, must not hard things be said?
You Have often told me, That the Souls of Kings
Are made above the rest of Humane Race;
Have they not Fortunes fitted for those Souls?
Did ever King die Starved?

I know not that:
Yet still be firm in this: The Gods are good,
Though thou and I may perish.

Indeed I know not,
That ever I offended Heaven in thought:
I always said my Prayers.

Thou did thy Duty.

And yet you lost the Battle when I Prayed.

'Twas in the Fates I should: But hold thee there!
The rest is all unfathomable depth:
This we well know, That if there be a Bliss
Beyond this present Life, it is purchased here,
And Virtue is its price.

But are you sure
Our Souls shall be Immortal?

Why that Question?

Because I find, that now my Body starves,
My Soul decays: I think not as I did:
My Head goes round: And now you swim before me*
Methinks my Soul is like a Flame, unfed
With Oil, that dances up and down the Lamp,
But must expire ere long.

I prithee try to hold it while thou can.

I would obey you,
As I have always done, but I am faint;
And when you please to let me die, I Will thank you.

Thou shall have Food: I promise thee, thou shall.

Then you shall promise to have Food for your self too;
For if you have it not, I would refuse to eat:
Nay I would choose to die, that you might seed on me.

Mark, Heaven, his Filial Love,
And if a Family of such as these
Must perish thus, your Model is destroyed
By which you made good Men.

Be cheerful, Sir, The Gods have sent us Food.

They tried me of the longest: But by whom?

Go in and see.

Good Father, do not stay to ask, but go.

Go thou -- thy Youth calls fiercer than my Age.

But then make haste: and come to take your part:
Hunger may make me impious to eat all,
And leave you last to starve --

Sir, will you go?

I know not: I am half seas over to Death!
And since I must die once, I would be loath
To make a double work of what is half finished;
Unless I could be sure the Gods would still
Renew these Miracles: Who brought this Food?

He Is here that can resolve you!

How dare thou come again within my sight?
Thou art -- but it is no matter what thou art, --
I Will not consider thee so far to think
Thee worth Reproach. -- Away, away Egyptian!
That Is all the Name that is left Thee.

Such I appear indeed:

Why then for once, that which thou seem thou art:
Be gone.

Oh I have been too long away!

Too soon thou art returned,
To Triumph over my Fate.

Forgive me, that I seemed your Foe.

Forgive me, Heaven, for thinking thee my Friend:
No more; it is loss of Time to talk.

Indeed it is,
When hunger calls so loud for Sustenance.
But whether Friend or Foe, it is Food I bring.

It Is Poison; and my Mother, and my Wife,
And my poor famished Boy are eating Death:
Thou would not have me think that thou repent'st?

Heaven knows, I do not!

Well said, Man! Go on -- and be not bashful
To own the Merits of thy Wickedness.

What need has Innocence of a Repentance?

Shuffling again! Prithee be of a piece.
A little steddiness becomes a Villain.

Oh! Friend -- for yet I dare to call you so;
Which if I were a Villain; sure I durst not.
Hear me -- or kill me!

So, by Heaven, I would,
For thy profaning Friendship's holy Name:
But for thou see no Justice hanging here
On this bare side, thou talk secure of Vengeance.

Then if you had a Sword, my Death's resolved!

Thy Conscience answers thee.

Without more Evidence than bare Surmise;
At most appearance of a Crime unprov'd;
And while unprov'd, uncertain?

Traitor, no more; it is fulsome!

Take the Sword --

I thank thee -- Draw thy own.

No -- Take that too.

Fool -- Would thou die without Defense?

I would not:
But you forbad me to defend my self,
Then, when you would not hear me!

Can Falsehood have a better Argument
Than Force for its Defense? Trust to that Topic,
And bear thee like a Man.

I think, I do.

What kind of Man is that, who dares not fight?

The Man, who dares not when his Honor calls,
Is what you mean; but what I never was:
For Honor never summons without Reason.
Force is the Law of Brutes. The dumb Creation,
Where Words and Reason want, appeal to Might.
I thought a King, and what you boast, a Spartan,
Might have known this without the Aegyptian's telling.

Come, Come; Thou dare not fight.

By Heaven, I dare.
But first my Honor must be justified,
If you dare be my Judge:
For in this crude and indigested Quarrel,
If I should fall unheard, you kill your Friend,
The Man who loved you best, and holds you dearest.
And should you perish in the unjust Attempt,
The Sword that slew you, should revenge your Death:
For I should soon overtake you in the way,
To quit my self before you reached the Shades,
And told your Tale to Minos.

Then I must hear: But swear, swear first I charge thee,
That when I have pronounced, thou will no more
Prolong thy prattle with some new Excuse:
And prithee cut it short -- because I faint,
And long to kill thee first: Oh, I am going,
A rising Vapor rumbles in my Brains.
I hear my Words far off -- stand, stand, thou Traitor,
And swim not thus before me -- it is too late,
And I fall unrevenged --

What, ho, Pantheus!
The best of Men is dying in my Arms,
And I want power to save him.

Oh Heavens! what means this direful Object?

Ask not with unassisting pity; bow him forward;
Rub his numbed Temples, while I wipe the Sweat
From his cold clammy Face.

His mounting Heart
Bounces against my hands, as if it would
Thrust off his manly Soul.

Wrench open his mouth,
While I infuse these Sovereign Drops, whose Power
Will soon recall his wandered sense --
He stirs!
And stretches now, and seems to essay his Limbs.

Where am I?

In his Arms, who died with you;
And now you live, revives.

Art thou, Panthaeus?

Believe your Eyes, I am.

Speak then, and truly, (for I trust not him,)
Who brought me back to Life?

Who, but he, who was left single with you,
Who caught you falling in his faithful Arms;
And not alone sufficient to restore you,
Called loud for my Assistance:
I found him propping you with trembling Hands;
His Eyes so haggard, I could scarce distinguish
Who was the living Friend, and who the dead.

All this Cleanthes! This, What this Cleanthes?

Yes, your Cleanthes.

Your suspected Friend,
Much wronged, but ever faithful!

Art thou sure
I live? Or am I in the Regions of the dead?
And hear the Fables there; my self a Fable?

Go in, and see your cheerful Family
Eating his Bread, brought in their last Distress;
And with a good mistaking Piety,
First blessing him, then Heaven!

When I hear this, I have no need of Food:
I am restored without it.

Then, now hear me,
How I was forced into this seeming Falsehood,
To save my self, the only means remaining
To save the Man I loved beyond my self;
And gain a needful Credit with Cassandra:
And yet even then deceived, and sent far off
For three long Days, unknowing of your wants,
Not thinking she, who loved, could use you thus.
By Famishment to --

O no more! no more!
For now I understand ever thou can speak it half:
To thee I owed the seizing of my Sword,
Lest I should fall by odds -- My Wife's return,
All, all to thee -- And thou art more than all:
Can thou forgive me? Can thou, my Cleanthes?
Can I deserve thus to grow here once more?
Let me embrace my self quite into thee.

Come, come as fiercely as thou will -- I meet thee --
I close within thee, and am thou again.

Why, this is as it should be.

I could not thus have taken to the Death
Another Falsehood, but thine, only thine:
For infinitely, infinitely loving,
'Twas a wide gap thou made within my Bosom,
And as my Soul rent from me.

But thy Hunger!
This violent Transport of my Reconcilement,
Makes me forget thy Wants -- When I embraced thee
Thy spungy Body dwindled in my Arms,
And like a Ghost fled from me.

I could eat --
Now my first Appetite of Love is served;
And that was much the keenest: Let us in;
For Life looks lovely now, and worth preserving.

Not that way, Friend --
It leads you to the Women, and the Boy.

And why must I avoid those tender Blessings?

Even such, because they are, you must avoid them.
For I must tell you, Friend, you have but time
To snatch a hasty Morsel, and away:
Nothing of Manhood must be clogged or softened
With Womanish Sighs and Tears, and kind Adieu's!
And those ill-timed Remorses of good Nature,
When your whole Soul is needful.

You tell us Wonders!

At the King's Return,
Which daily we expect, your Death's resolved:
This hour's your own! Take it, and tempt your Fortune;
Some few brave Friends I hope to add;
If not, all Aegypt's numbered in my self.

I am all on Fire; now for a lucky pull
At Fate's last Lottery:
I long to see the Color, white or black;
That Is the God's Work: And if I fall their shame,
Let 'em never think of making Heroes more,
If Cowards must prevail.

The fewer Hands,
The fewer Partners in the share of Honor.

Come, my Pantheus: Lead, my best Cleanthes!
We three to all the World.

Magas, and Liberty, let be the Word:
Magas is loved, and Liberty desired.
A short Refection waits at the Lieutenant's,
That honest Friend, who sent you back your Wife;
We'll drink a Bowl of Wine, and pour the rest,
Not to the Dog Anubis; but to Jove,
The Freer and Avenger.

Gone -- and without taking leave!

The better.
He bated me the Forms, and you the Fondness.

Pantheus too, and he who brought the Food,
The brave Egyptian, vanished all together.

Oh, my fore-boding Soul! he is gone to Death!
And that Cleanthes, whom thou call'st the Brave,
Has basely trained him out to his Destruction!

Suspect him not: When Fate was in his power,
And by a Method so secure as Famine;
To save us then, shows he had little need
To trick my Son to Death:
I have a better prospect of the Event.

Dear Mother! Comfort me and tell your Thoughts;
For I see nothing but a gathering Tempest,
Horror on Horror to the end of Heaven!

No, no; you are not of a Soul to bear
The mighty Good and Ill that meet midway,
As from two Goals; and which comes first upon us,
Fate only knows.

Then speak to me; for I can stand the Shock,
Like a young Plant that fastens in a Storm,
And deeper drives the Root.

Thy Soul's too strong; thy Body yet too weak
To bear the Crush: Be still, and wait thy Doom.

What noble sound was that? So smart and vigorous?
A Soul in every Word.

Why that was it,
I thought, was doing; but I durst not tell,
Till now it shows it self.
The Works begun, my Boy; the Works begun:
There was thy Father in that Warlike Shout,
Stemming the Tide of Egypt.

O comfort me, my Husband's Mother; say,
My Lord may live and conquer.

Possibly:
But still make sure of Death: Trust we to that,
As to our last Reserve.

Alas, I dare not die.

Come, come, you dare:
Do not belie your Courage.

Heaven help me, I have none.

Then dare you be a Slave to base Egyptians?
For that must be, if you outlive your Husband.

I think, I durst, to save my self from Death.

Then, as a Slave, you durst be ravished too?

The Gods forbid.

The Gods cannot forbid it
By any way but Death.

Then I dare die.

I told you so: You did not know your Virtue.
Poor trembling thing; I Will warm thee in my Bosom,
And make thee take Death kindly.

What must become of me?

More Trouble yet about this paltry Being?
For shame no more such Qualms!

No more such vile Mistakes! I would die warm,
And not in Women's Company -- but Men's.
Whether some God inspires me to this Act,
Or Fate inevitably calls me on,
I will not, cannot stay:
But as a generous, unflesh'd Hound, that hears
From far the Hunter's Horn and cheerful Cry;
So will I haste; and by the Music led,
Come up with Death or Honor --

Stop him, dear Mother; he may comfort us,
But cannot help his Father.

The Hero's Blood is not to be controlled;
Even in a Child it is madly Masterful:
But wait we patient with our petty Stakes,
Which on those greater Gamesters must depend;
For as they throw, our little Lots must follow,
Like sweepings of their heap.

What? Is this populous City turned a Desert?
The Cry of Liberty runs on before us;
And yet not one appears!
By Hercules! we drive 'em through their Town:
They dare not stay to welcome their Deliverers.

The Cowards are afraid of what they wish:
And could they be their own, they would be ours.

They Are gone! We talk to Houses and to Walls.

Not so: I see some peeping from their Doors.
What are you, Friends or Foes?

Friends, Friends: All honest Men, and Hearty to the Cause.

Explain what Cause -- and give the general Cry.

Liberty and Magas.

Magas!
The Cowards whisper Liberty so softly,
As if they were afraid the Gods should hear it,
And take 'em at their Word.

No, Friend: We Vulgar never fear the Gods:
But we whisper, for fear our over-thwart Neighbors
Should hear us cry, Liberty, and betray us to the Government.

Of what side are you there?

That Is according as you succeed: Of your side hitherto.

If you are Men, come join with us.

You are too few for us to join with you; but get the greater Party of your
side, and we'll be sure to help the Common Cry


Dare you do nothing to assert your Freedom?


Yes; We'll pray devoutly for you.


The Brave pray with their Swords; that is a Man's part.


Pray with our Swords, the Law calls Fighting;
And Fighting is Bloodshed; And Bloodshed is Hanging;
And Hanging is the part of a Dog, and not of a Man, in my opinion.

Every one shift for himself,
The Government is a coming.

Run; couch, ye Cowards, to your Tyrant Lords.
A Dog you worship, and partake his Nature:
A Race of speaking Spaniels.

Let 'em go; We'll do our work without 'em.

The comfort is, our Foes are like our Friends --
Holy Day Hero's, drawn out once a month,
At public Charge to Eat, and to be Drunk:
Mere Mouths of War.

'Twas what I always feared; even when I saved Thee,
To find thee thus engaged among my Foes:
But, yet submit; And I can yet forgive Thee:
Consider; for it is all I have time to say,
Thou fight'st against thy Father.

Against my Father's Cause, but not my Father:
If you would needs become your self a Slave,
And get me such, I must redeem us both,
And will, or perish in the brave Attempt.

Withdraw thy self from ruin: I command Thee.

Command I cannot: But, I beg you, Sir,
Engage not for an Arbitrary Power,
That odious Weight upon a Free-born-soul.

This is too much; fall on: But spare my Son.

Sosybius, hold! Withdraw your Men to distance:
You know this Signet: Obey your King in Me.

Never more gladly: Though my Son's a Rebel;
Yet Nature works to save him.

Then rather than he should untimely fall,
I would forgive the Rest: and offer Life,
Even to that Fugitive, if he please to treat.

Be short: and, if you can, for once, sincere.

What can you hope from this unequal Fight,
Where numbers rise from every Foe you kill,
And grow from their defeat?

We come resolved:
And to die killing is a kind of Conquest.

But are not Life and Freedom worth accepting,
When offered; and, with such Conditions too,
As make 'em both more pleasing? Your Friends safety,
Your Son, your Mother, and that only She,
Who loves you best, for your Companion home:
You know what She I mean.

No private parley --
Spartans do all in public.

We know your reasons for those secret whispers;
And to your Infamy --


No injuries from Women can provoke
A Man of Honor to expose their Fame.
Madam; We understand each other well:
My Son, my Mother, and my Wife restored,
It Is Peace; if not, it is War.

A fair Proposal: Be it Peace.

No, Fool! it is War. Know, Heavy Hero, know,
I gained this time for my secure Revenge;
To seize thy Wife and Mother: And to stab Thee
On both sides of thy Heart, they are gone to die,
To make thy Death more painful. Farewell, Traitor!
And thank thy self -- not me --

Revenge, revenge,
And speedy Death, or Conquest: Hold, Cleanthes!
Poor Boy!
By Heaven, I am pleased to see thee safe this moment,
Though I expect the next to lose thee. Guard him,
Cleanthes: Set him safe behind the Front.

Come, Sir: You are now my Charge!

The Gods forbid
That I should seek this danger, and not share it.

To prove my self your Son; living, or dying,
I Will not be less than Man.

Oh! I could chide Thee.
But there is no time: for Love and Anger both
Fight by my side; and Heaven protect thy Courage.

Pantheus, hold; or, turn thy Sword on me.




Till I have set my Father safe.

The Gods reward thy pious Care.

This was well watched: The Boy is left ungarded.

Oh! I am slain by Treason!
Revenge me, Royal Father.

'Twas sure his voice:
Too sure: Pity and Rage
Distract my Soul: but rage will first be served.
There Is Justice for my self, and for my Son!
Look up, sweet Boy,
And tell me that thou liv'st.

Fain I would live
To Comfort you: I bleed and am ashamed
To say I faint, and call my self your Son;
O Traitor Coenus? What Is become of him?

Look, there he lies.

I am glad on it,
Forgive me, Heaven: I hope it is no offense
To say I am glad, because he killed me basely.
Still, I grow fainter: Hold me, hold me, Father.

Cheer up, and thou shall live.

No: I Am just dying.

What shall I lose?

A Boy: That Is all. I might have lived to Manhood:
But once I must have died.

But not before thy Father?

Nay: then you envy me, that I am first Happy:
I go; and when you come pray find me out
And own me for your Son. --

There went his Soul: Fate thou have done thy worst,
And all thou can henceforth; is but mean Slaughter,
The gleanings of this Harvest. --

Sir, y're well found: our Enemies are fled:
I left our men pursuing, and made haste
To bring this joyful News.

Look there, and if thou dare, now give me joy.

Enough! y' have stopped my mouth -- what Coenus killed?
I ask no Questions then, of who killed who:
The Bodies tell their Story as they lie.
Haste, and revenge!

Where are our Enemies?

Sculking, dispersed in Garrets, and in Cellars.

Not worth the seeking: Are these fit t'atone
For Cleomenes Mother, Son, and Wife?
But what the Gods have left us, we must take.

It Is all in vain: we have no further work:
The People will not be dragged out to Freedom:
They bar their Doors against it: Nay, the Prisoners
Even guard their Chains, as their inheritance;
And Man their very Dungeons, for their Masters:
Lest Godlike Liberty, the Common Foe,
Should enter in; and they be judged hereafter
Accomplices of Freedom.

Then, we may sheath our Swords.

We may, Pantheus;
But so as brave men should, each in his Bosom.
That only way is left us to die free.

All Is lost for which I once desired to live.

Come, to our business then: Be speedy Sir;
And give the word; I Will be the first; to charge
The Grim Foe, death.

Fortune, Thou have reduced me very low,
To do the Drudgery of fate my self!
What! not one brave Egyptian! not one worthy
To do me manly Right, in single Combat!
To fall beneath my fury? For that is Justice:
But, then to drag me after: For to die,
And yet, in Death to Conquer, is my Wish!

Then have your Wish: The Gods at last are kind:
And have provided you a Sword that is worthy
To match your own: It Is an Egyptians too.

Is there that hidden Treasure in thy Country?
The Gods be praised -- for such a Foe I want.

-- Not such a Foe, but such a Friend am I.
I would fall first, for fear I should survive you,
And pull you after to make sure in Death,
To be your undivided Friend for ever.

Then enter We into each others Breasts.
It Is a sharp passage; yet a kind one too.
But to prevent the blind mistake of Swords,
Lest one drop first, and leave his Friend behind,
Both thrust at once, and home, and at our Hearts:
Let neither stand on Guard, but let our Bosoms
Lie open to each other in our Death,
As in our Life they were --

I Seal it thus.

And where is my part? You shut me out like Churls,
While you devour the Feast of Death betwixt you.

Cheer up thy Soul, and thou shall die Pantheus:
But in thy turn: There Is Death enough for all:
But as I am thy Master, wait my leisure,
And honestly Compose my Limbs to Rest,
Then serve thy self. -- Now are you ready, Friend?

I am.

Then this to our next happy meeting --

Speak, have I served you to your Wish, my Friend?

Yes, Friend -- thou have -- I have thee in my heart --
Say -- art Thou sped?

I am, it is my last Breath.

And mine -- Then both are Happy --

So, this was well performed and soon dispatched:
Both sound asleep already,
And farewell both for one short moment.
Those are the Foes, our little band is lost
For want of these Defenders: I must hasten,
Lest I be forced to live, and led in Triumph;
Defrauded of my Fate: I Have earned it well,
And finished all my Task: This is my place:
Just at my Masters feet -- Guard him, ye Gods,
And save his sacred Corpse from public shame --

It Is what my Heart foreboded: There he lies,
Extended by the Man whom best he loved!
A better Friend than Son.

What Is he, or Thou? or Ptolomy? or Egypt?
Or all the world to Cleomenes lost?

Then I suspected right: If my revenge,
Can ease my sorrow; This, the King shall know;
That thou may reap the due reward of Treason,
And violated Love.

Thy worst old Dotard.
I wish to die: but if my mind should Change,
So well I know my Power, that Thou art lost.

The King's arrival shall decide our Fate.
Mean time to show how much I honor Virtue,
Take up that Hero's Body, bear it high,
Like the Procession of a Deity:
Let his armed Figure on his Tomb be set,
And We like Slaves lie grovling at his feet;
Whose Glories growing till his latest Breath,
Excelled all others: And his own in Death. --
