Look, look! rejoice, and wonder!
That you offending mortals are,
(For all your crimes) so much the care
Of him, that bears the thunder!
JOVE can endure no longer,
Your great ones should your less invade,
Or, that your weak, though bad, be made
A prey unto the stronger.
And therefore, means to settle
ASTRAEA in her seat again;
And let down in his golden chain
The age of better mettle.
Which deed he does the rather,
That even envy may behold
Time not enjoyed his head of gold
Alone beneath his father.
But that his care conserueth
As time, so all times honors too,
Regarding still what heaven should do,
And not what earth deserves.
But hark, what tumult from yond' cave is heard!
What noise, what strife, what earthquake and alarmes!
As troubled Nature, for her maker, feared;
And all the iron-age were up in arms!
Hide me, soft cloud, from their prophaner eyes,
Till insolent rebellion take the field,
And as their spirits, with their counsels, rise,
I frustrate all, with showing but my shield.

COme forth, come forth, do we not hear
What purpose, and, how worth our fear,
The King of gods has on us?
He is not of the iron breed
That would, though Fate did help the deed
Let shame in so upon us.
Rise, rise then up, thou Grandame vice
Of all my issue, Avarice,
Bring with thee fraud and slander,
Corruption with the golden hands
Or any subtle^ill, that stands
To be a more commander.
Thy boys, Ambition, Pride, and Scorn,
Force, Rapine, and thy babe last borne,
Smooth Treachery call hither,
Arm Folly forth, and Ignorance,
And teach them all our Pyrrhick dance,
We may triumph together,
Upon this enemy so great,
Whom, if our forces can defeat,
And but this once bring under,
We are the masters of the skies,
Where all the wealth, height, power, lies,
The scepter, and the thunder.
Which of you would not in a war
Attempt the price of any scarre,
To keep your own states even?
But, here, which of you is that he,
Would not himself the weapon be,
To ruin JOVE and heaven?
About it then, and let him feel,
The iron-age is turned to steel,
Since he begins to threat her:
And though the bodies here are less
Then were the Giants; he will confess
Our malice is far greater.

SO change, and perish, scarcely knowing, how,
That'gainst the gods do take so vain a vow:
And think to equal with your mortal dates,
Their lives that are obnoxious to no fates,
'Twas time t'appeare, and let their follies see
Against whom they fought, and with what destinee
Die all, the can-remaine of you, but stone,
And that be seen a while, and then be none.
Now, now, descend you both beloved of JOVE,
And of the good on earth no less the love,
Descend you long long wished, and wanted pair,
And as your softer times divide the air,
So shake all clouds off, with your golden hair,
For spite is spent: the iron age is fled,
And, with her power on earth, her name is dead.

And are we then,
To live again,
With men?

Will JOVE such pledges to the earth restore
As justice?

or the purer ore?


But do they know,
How much they owe,
Below?

And will of grace receive it, not as due?

If not, they harm themselves, not you.

True.

True.

Let narrow Natures (how they will) mistake,
The great should still be good for their own sake.

Welcome to earth and reign.

But how without a train
Shall we our state sustain?

Leave that to JOVE: therein you are
No little part of his MINERVA'S care.
Expect a while.
You farre-fam'd spirits of this happy I Will,
That, for your sacred songs have gained the style
Of PHOEBVS sons: whose notes they air aspire
Of the old Egyptian, or the Thracian lyre,
That Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate, Spencer hight
Put on your better flames, and larger light,
To wait upon the age that shall your names new nourish,
Since virtue pressed shall grow, and buried arts shall flourish.

We come.

We come.

Our best of fire
Is that which PALLAS does inspire.

Then see you yonder souls, set far within the shade,
And in Elysian bowres the blessed seats do keep,
That for their living good, now semigods are made,
And went away from earth, as if but tamed with sleep:
These we must join to wake; for these are of the strain
That justice dare defend, and will the age sustain.

Awake, awake, for whom these times were kept,
O wake, wake, wake, as you had never slept,
Make haste and put on arie, to be their guard,
Whom once but to defend, is still reward.

Thus PALLAS throws a lightning from her shield.

To which let all that doubtful darkness yield.

Now peace.

and love,

faith.

Joys,

all all increase.

And strife

and hate,

and fear,

and pain,

all cease.

No tumor of an iron vain.
The causes shall not come again.

But, as of old, all now be gold.
Move, move then to these sounds.
And, do, not only, walk your solemn rounds,
But give those light and ayrie bounds,
That fit the Genij of these gladder grounds.
Already? Do not all things smile?

But when they have enjoyed a while,
The ages quickening power:

That every thought a seed does bring,
And every look a plant does spring,
And every breath a flower:

Then earth vnplough'd shall yield her crop,
Pure honey from the oak shall drop,
The fountain shall run milk:
The thistle shall the lilly bear,
And every bramble roses wear,
And every worm make silk.

The very shrub shall Balsame sweat,
And Nectar melt the rock with heat,
Till earth have drunk her fill:
That she no harmefull weed may know,
Nor barren Fern, nor Mandrake low,
Nor Mineral to kill.

But here is not all: you must do more,
Or else you do but half restore
The ages liberty.

The male and female used to join,
And into all delight did coin
That pure simplicity.
Then feature did to form advance,
And youth called beauty forth to dance,
And every grace was by.
It was a time of no distrust,
So much of love had naught of lust,
None feared a jealous eye.
The language melted in the ear,
Yet all without a blush might hear,
They lived with open vow.

Each touch and kiss was so well placed,
They were as sweet as they were chaste,
And such must yours be now.

What change is here! I had not more
Desire to leave the earth before,
Then I have now, to stay;
My silver feet, like roots, are wreathed
Into the ground, my wings are sheathed,
And I cannot away.
Of all there seems a second birth,
It is become a heaven on earth,
And Jove is present here,
I feel the Godhead: nor will doubt
But he can fill the place throughout,
Whose power is every where.
This, this, and only such as this,
The bright Astraea's region is,
Where she would pray to live,
And in the amidst of so much gold,
Unbought with grace or fear unsold*
The law to mortals give.
It Is now enough, behold you here,
What JOVE has built to be your sphere,
You hither must retire.
And as his bounty gives you cause,
Be ready still without your pause
To show the world your fire.
Like lights about ASTRAEA'S throne,
You here must shine, and all be one,
In feruor and in flame.
That by your union she may grow,
And, you sustaining her, may know,
The age still by her name.
Who vows, against, or heat or cold,
To spin you garments of her gold,
That want may touch you never,
And making garlands every hour,
To write your names in some new flower,
That you may live for ever.

To Jove, to Jove, be all the honor given,
That thankful hearts can raise from earth to heaven.
