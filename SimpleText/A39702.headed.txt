AY me! and is he gone!
And I left here alone!
Ah Theseus stay --
But see he sails away,
And never minds my moan --
Yet sure he does not fly me,
But only dos 't to try me;
And he will return again --
Oh no! that hope is vain,
He Is gone, he is gone,
And I left here alone,
Poor wretch! the most forlorn,
As ever yet was born,
With killing dolors more than Tongue can speak,
O heart, why dos't not break?

It Is still the Heavens peculiar care,
Of all that is nobly Good, and Fair,
That when they suffer, every one
Claims right to soft compassion;
So the liquid Waves do weep, and moan,
The gentle Winds do sigh, and groan,
While the Rocks with Echoes measure keep
To the Music of the Air, and of the Deep;
Only Theseus, more hard, more cruel far than they,
Never minds her grievous plaints, but sails away.
BUt why thus weep I, for that perfidious, who
Abandons, and leaves me so?
Let him weep rather, so perfidiously
Leaves and Abandons me.
" Only for proper Guilt,
" Tears should be spilt.
And so they shall, if there be any Powers
Beyond this Sphere of ours,
In Heaven, or the Abyss,
To punish crimes like this.
As it is your Interest, O ye Powers divine!
As well as mine:
For let him pass unpunished, and who shall
Hereafter think there is any Gods at all?
But you 'r too pitiful, and are not bent
Cruelly enough; -- I Will be his punishment;
If there be any Magic in a Curse,
Dire Imprecations, horrid Vows, or worse,
I Will thunder Tempests on his catif head,
That now is fled,
I Will storm, and whirlwinds of my breath,
Mixed with the angry lightning of mine Eyes,
More violent by far
Than those that darted are
From the enraged Skies,
Shall hurry him to death,
My Angers sacrifice:
When thou pale trembling Theseus then,
Wretchedst of Men,
Shall find, when it is too late,
" Nothing 's more cruel than a Lovers hate.

Shall we the whilst contribute nothing to
Her rage, as well as to her woe?

Yes, first we'll murmur, and hiss him unto scorn,
Then rage, and crowd our selves into a Storm.

And up we'll bear him, till he touch the Skies,
Then down, till buried in the Deep he lies.

Away, away, then let 's about it strait.

Stay, yet her farther pleasure let us await.

BUt alas! what can I do?
But only wish and wish, and scarcely too,
For I recall them, would to Heaven, withal,
I Theseus but as easily could recall;
I repent me of them too, would thou could tell,
O Theseus, to repent thee but as well;
Then should poor Ariadne not complain,
As now, alas! she does, nor burst again
With thronging sobbs and sighs, more than she ever can vent,
For thy grieved loss, more than she can lament.

BLow, blow, my Sighs,
Flow, flow, my Tears then, till you overflow,
And drown me so;
And then congeal, till Ariadne be
A colder Stone than Niobe;
And so become
Her own sad Tomb:
Or let my pining Grief consume me so,
Hereafter none may ever know,
Unto her foul disgrace,
Ariadne ever was:
Or chaage me to a thin unbodied Ghost,
Some aerie spirit, or substance, or at most
An Animated groan,
And an Eternal moan.

COme Children of the Bottle, and let us have a round
As long as but liquor in the Bottles is sound,
Drink, merrily drink,
Whilst the Flaggons do clink,
And glasses do tink,
And each one does think
That the world turns round a, round a,
And no body sober be found a.
Fill the Cups full,
Fill the Cups full Boys,
And say what they wull,
Say what they wull Boys,
There is no life but in Liquor.
For Aesculape
's but Phoebus's Ape,
And Phoebus but Bacchus's Vicar.
IO, Lyaeus, Evan, Bacchus,
Nysaeus, Bromius, and Iacchus,
Twice-born, to show, Divinity
Was redoubled in thee;
Whilst all the Inhabitants of the Skies
Besides, are simple Deities.
Io, Lyaeus, Evan, Bacchus,
Nysaeus, Bromius, and Iacchus,

O All ye Heavenly Deities!
What lovely grief and sorrow 's this,
At once mine eyes, and admiration draw?
Surpassing far
All ravishing joys that are,
Or yet I ever saw!
And can those sighs be breathed into air,
From lips so fair, and sweet,
But we must straightway see 't:
Ambrosique sweet, as Rosy fair?
And can those Tears, let fall
From her bright eyes, not strait congeal withal
To Pearls, we more than Oriental call? --
Divine beauty, compared to whom,
Divinity does less become,
Who have un-godded Bacchus, and
Made him here thy Suppliant stand,
Doubtful whe'r any thing he be,
Till 't be determined of by thee.
Neither would he be divine,
Farther than he may be thine --
Behold a God falls down before thee,
Lowly prostrat to adore thee.

Sovereign Beauty, have the power,
To conquer that great Conqueror
Of all the Indies far and wide,
And all the adjacent world beside;
Sing we of all the Gods above,
The mightiest of all is Love,
In Heaven and Earth, when e'^ he please,
Can do such mighty things as these.

SOrrow does so heavy sit
Upon her, as she moves not yet:
Sing then again, and with a merrier lay,
Chase her importunater grief away.

THen let us sing to make her merry,
And laugh til our cheeks be as red as a cherry
And make all laugh as well as we*
With ho, ho, ho, and he, he, he.

Laughter every one does love,
From him below, to him above,
Appearing still with countenance gay,
Chasing care and grief away,
Chearing with her cheerful face;
Whilst your melancholy Ass,
Who smiles just as his Lips were starcht,
Or his mouth burnt up and parcht,
Nor does ever laugh outright,
But when Dogs, perchance, do fight,
Or some other mischief 's done,
Is hated for it by every one.
LEt those then care and sorrow love,
Weeping- Heraclites approve,
Laughing- Democritus for me,
With ho, ho, ho, and he, he, he.

He who laughs not at a Jest,
's like him who eats not at a Feast,
Either of them, you must grant,
Does both wit, and stomach want;
I Would not give a pin for him,
Cannot laugh at every thing,
At the wagging of a Feather,
Or Straw's motion (choose ye whether)
And but fall, and there is laughter
For a week or fortnight after.
Who say Fools only laugh, do lie,
I say the are only Fools who cry.
LEt those then care and sorrow love,
Weeping- Heraclites approve,
Laughing- Democritus for me,
With ho, ho, ho, and he, he, he.

(...) Airer than fairest, if your eyes,
(...) Cleerer than the cleerer skies,
^ign to look upon a Lover,
^^o this bold Truth dares discover
^^at he loves, and loves most true,
(...) withal loves only you,
^old none of the ignoblest I,
and here, could boast a Deity,
(...) that I hold it greater boast,
^vaunt that I love you the most --
In pledge of which love, deign O fairest,
Sweetest, dearest, and the rarest,
TO accept of this poor Crown you see,
And with 't of Immortality;
Since after once it is dignifyed
By you, 't shall strait be stellifyed,
And in the clearest Skies appear,
Exalted to the highest Sphere,
The brightest Constellation there
What says my dearest?

What should I say?
But where the Gods command, there Mortals mus^ obey*

LEad on in Triumph then, and let the Fame
Of brightest Ariadne's name,
Whilst with glory she is crowned,
From Earth to highest Heaven resound,
From t'on to the other Pole be known,
From the Suns rise, to his going down.

Never was conjunction more sweet,
Than where Divine and Fair do meet.
Nor ever were this happy pair,
Happier than now they are,
In his blessed Consortship she,
And in her Emoraces he.
Let Bacchus and Ariadne's name,
Be ever (then) i'^h' mouth of fame,
And ever fill the worlds large ear,
And in Accents loud and cl^er,
From t'on to the other Pole be known,
From the Suns rise, to his going down.
