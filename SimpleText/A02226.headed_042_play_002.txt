SOLIMAN. ROSSA.

Rossa! The Eternal wisdom does not covet
Of man, his strength, or reason, but his love.
And not in vain: Since love, of all the powers,
Is it which gouernes every thought of ours.
I speak by Mustapha: For as a Father,
How often deemed I those light-iudging praises
Of multitudes, whom my love taught to flatter,
Truths oracles; and Mustapha's true stories?
So dearly Nature bidds our own be loved:
So ill a Judge is love of things beloved.
But is contempt the fruit of Parents care?
Does kindness lessen Kings authority,
Teaching our Children pride, our Vassalls wit,
To subject us, that subject are to it?
This frailty in my self I conquer must,
And stay the false untimely hopes it works,
Threatening the Fathers ruin in the Son:
Many with trust, with doubt few are undone.
Sent for he is: Nor shall the painted shows
Of fame, or kindness longer seele mine eyes?
For since he strives to undermine my Crown,
I will as firmly watch to keep him down.

Solomon my Lord! The knowledge who was Father
To Mustapha, made me (poor silly woman)
Think worth in blood had natural succession:
But now, I see, Ambitions mixtures may
The gold of Natures elements allay.
His Fame untimely borne: Strength strangely gathered,
Honor won with honoring, Greatness with humbleness,
(A Monarchs heir in courses popular,)
Make me divine some strange aspiring mind;
Yet doubtful; for it might be Art, or Kind.
But look into him by his outward ways:
Persia, our old imbrued enemy,
Treats of peace with the Son, without the Father:
A Course in all Estates to Princes nice;
But here much more; where he that Monarch is,
Must (like the Sun) have no light shine, but his.
The Offers; real Crowns, or hopes of Kingdoms.
What sudden knot has bound up our divisions?
Made them that only feared our greater growing,
Offer such proiects for our greater growing?
" It Is true, that private thoughts may easily change:
" But States, whose ways are Time; Occasion, Seat,
" Hane other ends, then Chance, in all they treat.
Yet be it, all the world would us obey;
In Monarchies: which surfeit, more than pine;
The King should judge: Strength knows what strength can weld:
The best foundation, else may ouer-build.
No, no: upon the pitch of high attemps
I see him stand, sporting with Wrong, and Fear:
For Law, and Duty, both are captives there.
His hopes, the hopes of all; for all aspire:
His means, that proud, rebellious Discontent,
Which scorns both Governors, and Government.
Solomon! Fear is broke loose within me.
What will, or may, mee-thinkes already happens;
His power thus great, will fixed, occasion ready,
Shadows of ruin to my heart deliver.
Confused noise within my ears does thunder
Of multitudes, that with obeying threaten.
Solomon! while fear, to lose thee, wishes death,
My fear again, to leave thee, wishes breath.

Rossa! I scorn there should be cause of fears
In one man's rage; for hard then were our state,
That reins of all the world desire to bear:
Yet thy disquiet shall increase my hate.
Thy wishes vain to thee yet never were:
For love, and Empire, both alike take pleasure,
Part of themselves upon deserts to measure.
And, but that all my joys have sorrows image,
I could say; I take pride in thine affection:
For Power may be feared; Empire adored;
Rewards may make knees bow; and self-love humble:
But love is only that which Princes covet;
And for they have it least, they most do love it.
Care therefore for thy self; I hold thee dear;
And as for me!
Though Fortune be of glass, and apt to break;
Kings life kept but in flesh, and easily pierced;
Kings Crowns no higher than private arms may reach;
Yet these all-daring spirits are rarely known,
That upon Princes graves dare raise a Throne.

Sir! few in number or Time presents children;
Where man ends, there ends discontentments empire;
Nouelty in flesh has always had a dwelling;
Then tell me Lord; what man would choose his room,
That must expect in wickedness a mean,
Or else be sure to feel a fatal doom?
Can that stay in the midst whose center's lowest?
Old age is Natures Poverty, and scorn;
Desires riches live in Princes children;
Their youths are Comets, within whose corruption
Men prophecy new hopes of better fortunes.
Ah Sir! Corrupt occasion still prefers
The wisdom, that for selfe-aduantage erreth.

Wisdom is not unto it self in debt,
That leaves nothing, but a God, above it.
Will he return from death unto the living?

No Sir! But much may hap before his death;
Who thinking nothing worse, and nothing after,
Knows thought of wrong is death, if Princes live;
Where dead, all heirs their own good do forgive.

I sent, he comes; and come is in my power.

Before he comes, who knows your fatal hour?
The wicked wrestle both with Might, and Slight:
" While Princes live, each man's life guardeth theirs;
" When they are dead, men's loves go with their fear.
Slain by the way less grudge, more safety were.

Wrong is not Princely; and much less is fear.

These glorious hazards tempt, and hasten fate;
They well become a Man, but not a State.

This fear in women shows a kindness too;
And is for men to thank, but not to do.

Is Providence of no more use to Power?

Than to preserve the Fame of Power entire,
Which often undermined is by fear.
I do suspect, yet is there nothing done;
I lose my Fame, if I so kill my Son.
Though I yet know not he has done amiss,
I doubt; and heavy Princes doubting is.
Though I resolve I will not kill him there;
It mortal is if Kings see cause to fear.
When Mustapha returns my jealous care
Will very hardly danger ouersee:
Order alone holds States in Unity.

Beglerbie Nuntius, Solomon. Rossa.

Fond Man! distract with diverse thoughts on foot,
That rack'st thy self, and Natures peace do break;
Iudgenot the Gods above: it does not boot,
Nor do thou see that which thou dare not speak.
Power has great scope; she walks not in the ways
Of private truth: Virtues of common men
Are not the same which shine in Kings above,
And do make fear bring forth the works of love.
Admit that Mustapha not guilty be;
Who by his Prince will rise, his Prince must please;
And they that please judge with humility.
Yonder they are, whose charge must be discharged,
In Ross^'s face behold desire speaks,
He keeps the laws, that all laws form breaks.

Is Mustapha in health, and coming?

My Lord! already come: For what can stay,
Where Love, and Duty both teach to obey?

In what strange balance are man's humors peised?
Since each light change within us, or without.
Turns fear to hope, and hope again to doubt.
If thus it work in Man, much more in Thrones,
Whose tender heights feel all thin aires that move,
And work that change below they use above.
For on the Axis of our humors turn
Church-rites, and Laws; Subjects desire, and wit;
Al^ which, in all men come, and go with it.
Rossa! a King ought therefore to suspect
Fears, fearful counsels which incline to blood,
Wherein, but truths, no Influence is good.
Else will inferior practice ever cast
Such glasly shadows upon all our errors,
As he that sees not ruin, shall see terrors.
Power therefore should affect the Peoples stamp,
" Whose good, or ill thoughts, ever prove to Kings,
" Like air, which either health, or sickness brings.
Now Rossa! by these straight lines, if we sound
The hollow depths of Rostens mystery;
He will the canker of this State be found.
Long has he wau'd betwixt my son, and me,
Making succession sacred, whilst he felt
Practice could not divide the bark, and tree:
His end being not to find, or cherish truth,
But rather vices, where his Art works ruth.
Long has he weighed our humors with his ends,
To find which nature was the fittest mould
For him, to bring to pass in, what he would.
And though his power be on my old age built,
Yet that, as slow to ruin, he dislikes:
Guilt seeking shields for every blow it strikes.
Now in my Son though active powers he find,
Yet what he cannot govern, gives offense;
From birth, or worth, still fearing competence.
He grounds this work on jealousy of Kings,
" Where hopeful goodnesses often in Successors
" Seem not strengths, as they be, but strong oppressors.
And when this Art could not procure his fall,
Nor shape our humors like Procustes bed,
Where all that fit him not, are ruined:
Straight then he offers up unto my Son
My life, my Crown, and all that I have won.
Such slender props are Princes Favorites,
" Who like good fortunes children, love their mother;
" And never can be true to any other.
In these nets shall he then catch him, and me,
And so this high, and sovereign Scepter-power
Sink into slaves by my infirmity?
No, No: when Princes, by defect of mind,
A pronesse feel, to sink into their slaves;
Wherein they make their Creatures their graves:
By Nature have they not a Phenix-fire,
From their own ashes to revive again,
And in their childrens honor, live, and raigne^
Then Rossa! judge: My love has made us one;
And who can judge these humorists, but we;
Since hope, and fear below lack eyes to see?
Mustapha is through misprision hither come,
Brought to the practice of this crafty slave,
Careless in which he make the others tomb:
His netts are laid; our thoughts for stales pitched down,
To catch our selves in, and in us, the Crown.
But Natures laws have conquered Princes doubts;
And between King, and man, what was begone,
Concludes betwixt a Father and a Son.

Behold! these sandy hearts have no foundation;
Yet hence must I, with hazard, work my will,
That have to do with thought, nor good, nor ill.
My Lord! your doubts from arguments did rise
Of wanton pride, ambitious seeking love:
" And can remissions be in Nature wise,
" While States upon the steep of danger move?
No: think what pregnant grounds of his ambition
Resolved you first, his Greatness was your danger:
And shall a Father wave a Kings suspicion?
Since Mischief, whilst her head shows in a clowd,
In Pluto's Kingdom does her body shroud.

Suspicion may enquire, but not conclude;
Both hope, and fear; do with excess delude.
Tell Beglerbie! how did he welcome thee?
In your access what found you; pomp, or pride?
Was he reserved; or else did he descend?
Appeared I as his Sovereign; or his friend?

His Court was great; and that which adds to you
Is that all Princes had their Agents there
Confessing, in the Son, the Fathers due:
And from them all the honor done him such,
As if none thought the World for him too much.
Yet I no sooner to his presence came,
But he paid all their homages to me,
The rest looked on, as when men wonders see.

What was his cheer? Did thou observe his eyes,
When thou declared'st my will to have him come?

First, at your name he bowed in humble wise;
The rest appeared to be a joyful doom.
Only the Persian spoke (it seems) with care:
God make these favors good; for they be rare.

This is the glass which Father looks not in;
The Workman hides, the instruments discover:
See how it fitts a King to be a lover?
Sir! mark these words: whence should their wonder grow?
His scorn, and grudge, he worshipps, and obeyes:
In him, or for him, what strange works are these?

Tell me his manner. How, did he dispose
His followers, and affairs till his return?
The news of war against our Persian foes,
I am sure, made not his undertakers mourn.

The Persian Agent some distraction showed;
All else their eyes to their Sun rising turn.

What Is the discourse of Court? and what the face?
His carriage is it Royally severe,
Reserved, like us, by attributes of place,
Or popular, as power in people were?
Shapes he his course to rule, or gain a State?
Is our course changed, or does he imitate?

He winds not spirits up with Power, or Fear:
The ancient form he keeps, where it is good:
His proiects reformation every where:
His care to have diseases understood:
Reverend unto your Throne; more to your deeds:
It is no imitation which exceeds.

What does he in our Church, or law reprove?
What error in our discipline of war?

With zeal he does adore the Powers above;
With zeal inferior duties paid him are:
And, for his ends on public centers move,
His ends are served with every bodies love.
His Court, like yours, the image of a Camp:
In yours, your Power; in his, Himself the Lamp.
He sees (men say) but only what he shows,
I mean examples both of Power, and Love:
You see again what from within you grows,
Such humble fear, as fearful power moves.
His Camp, in rest and action both, content;
Assiduous order works this frame in either:
Your discipline now loose, now ouerbent;
Forced to use fear in both, contents in neither.
This freedom Sir! makes them you two compare,
Of whom, both he and they, but shadows are.

What be his troops? An army, or a Train?
Come they to dwell, or to go back again?

His will was to depart immediately,
With no train, but the Basha, Priest, and I.
Your honor only ministered debate;
Princes (some thought) stood fast by keeping state:
His Pomp gave luster to your Power, some said,
For Princes should be gloriously obeyed.
At this gappe entered Love, and Intercession,
The Multitude all liberties approved,
The Wise to give them way held it discretion,
Where it gave honor to your self above.
Thus to the Coast number and order come,
Where Mustapha leaves all to bide your doom.

Within the Port, or where does he attend?
What Is the aspect between his own, and ours?
Gains he, or waines he by approaching power?

His foot on land, straight to the Church he goes;
Applause, and wonder follow to that place,
Greater he, by your Influence, still grows,
Your Trophies upon him the people place.
Unto the State men prophecy progression,
And see your age, it is true, in your Succession.
Your Power, and Love both, in his Pomp appear;
For even the Bassha's next you I did meet
Hastening to honor him, whom you hold dear.
What greater Triumph to a glorious Father,
Than such a Son for age to lean unto,
Whence declination may more forces gather,
And impotence retain ability to do?
Goodness exiling jealousy of State,
From him whose duty sets his power a rate.
Now by the way a paper up I took,
Spread by the Mufti, as it should appear,
Foretelling with authority of book,
What those times wrapped in clouds, and these make clear.
Wherein these Prophet-spirits did foreshow
The progress of this Empire to the height;
Under what Princes humors it should grow,
Under whose weakness fall again by weight:
Inferring this; that where declining spirits
To govern mighty Scepters God ordaines,
Order no Basis finds; Honor must fall:
Where man is nothing, Place cannot do all.
Again where worth, and wisdom sovereign be,
And he that is King of Place, is King of Men,
Change, Chance, or Ruin cannot enter then.
And such a King must sit upon this Throne;
Imperfect times (they say) are fully run,
And this perfection present in your Son.

Change has prepared her moulds for Innovation.
I see inferior wheels of practice move,
Yet they prevail not on the Powers above.
His worth rests constant, and yet works this motion,
They to him, for him, sacrifice at random
All which they have, and have not, in devotion.
He is the Glass, in which their light affections
Come to behold what image they shall take:
If liberty they find, then Anarchie they make.
On time, place, truth, these spirits never rest.
His worth, thus innocent, how can I fear?
Their thoughts, thus violent, can Power digest?
Then Government! thy hand must cut between
My fearful dangers, and his fearelesse praise.
In all States, Power, which oppresses spir^^s,
Imprisons Nature, Empire disinherits.
This Throne grew not by delicate alliance,
Combining State with State, all States to Laws,
Of idle Princes, and base subjects cause.
We grew by curious improuing all;
Our selves to people, people unto us;
Worth, through our selves, in them we planted thus.
And shall I help to make succession less,
Blasting the births of Nature and Example,
In narrow fears of selfe-vnworthinesse?
No, No: The art of Monarchy is more:
Princes must strength by such succession gather,
With future hopes all present smarts are eased;
Age has a veyle, and Majesty is pleased.
Who makes, can mar. Honor, reward, and fear,
Are reins of Power: The ends inherent there.

Behold! I stand amazed: Sir! ease my heart.
A King less than a man! more than a God!
I know not where to stay, nor how to part.
God has ordained that wickedness shall die:
Sir! who is guilty? Mustapha, or I?

He now is in the hands of Power, and Time.
His danger is to come, and ours is past;
Lets see into what moulds our own are cast.

Who will endure the sentence he may give,
Between you two? He must be King that lives.
Your grave prepared is among your own:
Neighbors, Church, People, Soldiers, made the Stage,
Where Hope, and Youth shall ruin Fear, and Age.
Most wretched I, raised to be overthrown.
If you will die, then am I lost in you;
And die you must, if you believe your own.
If he shall live; then am I proved untrue,
Hated by him, whom you have placed above,
Lost unto you, and ruined by my love.
" Ah Confidence! thou Glory of the ill!
" How safely do thou blinded Power assail,
" That having all, yet knows not what it will?

Rossa! you move me; yet remove I not.
Man comprehends a man, but not a King.
I feel my self ('it is true) and I feel you;
How to it self can Power then prove untrue?
Succession on the present never winnes,
But by the death of body, or of spirit:
All heirs by our mortality run in.
Let not misprision wound me in thy love:
Great inequality of worth you yield
To them, you think can on my ruins build.

LIke as mixed Humors, drawn up from the ground,
Are unto many forms, and functions bound;
Partly out of their native Property,
Partly the Climes, through which their iourneyes be;
Some into Meteors, that amaze below;
Others to Comets, which fore-threaten woe;
Some into Hailestones, that afflict the earth;
Others to Rain, which hastens every birth;
Lightning, and Thunder only made of those,
Which the cold Regions double heats enclose:
So is frail Mankind, though in other fashion,
Raised, and let fall with his own earthly passion;
Formed, transformed, and made instruments
In many shapes, to serve Powers many bents:
Feeding Superiors, even as Vapors do,
Which spending themselves, scourge their Parents too.
Some in mishaped Meteors, terrifying;
All constant spirits, under Tyrants lying;
Others like Winds, which AEolus makes blow,
To breathe themselves out, while they overthrow;
Some like sweet Dewes, that nourish where they touch;
Like Exhalations, some inflame too much;
Bondage, and ruin, only wrought by those,
That Kings with servile Flattery enclose,
Hatching, in double heats of Power, and Will,
Thunder, and Lightning, to amaze, and kill.
Thus Tyrants deal with Peoples liberty,
The nether Region cannot long live free.
Thus Tyrants deal with us of higher place,
As drawn up only to disperse disgrace.
Ecchos of Power, that pleasingly resound
Those heavy Taxes, where with Princes wound.
Exhausters of frail Mankind by our place,
To make them poor, and consequently base.
With Colonies we eat the Native down,
And, to increase the Person, waine the Crown.
With idle visions trafficking men's minds
To humble moderation, in all kinds
Till under false styles of Obedience,
We take from Mankind all, but suffering sense,
Yet even by these sails, which for Scepters move,
We forced are with modest breath to prove,
Which way these People-tides will pass with ease;
Crowns wounding deeply, when they strive to please.
Whence, as we dare not blow them up to rage;
So again, if we quit this People-stage,
Thrones know not where to act those fancie-playes,
Which catch the lookers on so many ways.
For we, like Dewes, drawn to be clouds above,
Straight grow with that attracting Sun in love;
Which ever raises light things up to fall,
In crafty Power Creation natural.
Wrapped in which Crowne-mists, men cannot discern
How dearly they her glittering tinctures earne,
Till, thorough glassie Time, these Cage-birds see,
That Honor is the badge of Tyranny.
Laws the next pillars be, with which we deal,
As Sophistries of every Commonweal;
Or rather Nets, which people do ask leave,
That they, to catch their Freedoms in, may weaue,
And still add more unto the Sultans power,
By making their own frames themselves devour.
These Lesbian rules, with show of real grounds,
Giving Right, narrow; Will, transcendent bounds.
The Mufti, and their spiritual jurisdictions,
By course succeed these other guilt-inflictions:
Conscience annexing to our Crescent star
All freedoms, that in Man's frail Nature are;
By making doctrines large, strict mild, severe;
As Power intends to stir, up hope, or fear:
Which heavenly shadow, with earth-centers fixed,
Rack men, by truth, and untruths, strangely mixed;
And prove to Thrones such a supporting cause,
As finely gives Law to all other Laws.
Thus like the Wood that yields helues for the Axe,
Upon it self to lay an heavy tax:
We silly Bassha's help Power to confound,
With our own strength exhausting our own ground.
An Art of Tyranny; which works with men,
To make them beasts, and high-rais'd Thrones their den,
Where they, that mischief others, may retire
Safe with their prey, as lifting Tyrants higher.
By which enthralling of our selves, with others,
Prove we not both Confusions heirs, and mothers?
Far unlike Adam, putting Civil names
Upon those errors, which the whole world blames.
For if Power rauine more than is her own;
People, we say, are Chequers to a Throne.
Again, if she to rise up, will pull down;
Creation, we say, still inheres the Crown.
If good men chance to interrupt this way;
Too much in virtue often there is, we say:
Since each inferior limb must from the Head
Receive his Standard and be balanced.
If People grudge their freedom, thus made thrall;
Power is their body, they but shadows all.
If God himself by Law, or Influence,
Seems but to limit this Omnipotence;
Even as in Christian Courts of Chancerie,
Though land, or Titles cannot settled be;
Yet where the Person dares to disobey,
Through him, his Title they imprison may:
So though with Tyrants God transcendent be,
Yet plague they his for too much piety.
And, by distinctions from the Pulpits doom,
Leave still for Crowne-impiety a room.
This is our office under Tyranny,
Where Power, and Passion only current be.
But where the Better rules the Greater part,
And reason only is the Princes Art;
There, as in Margents of great volum'd Books,
The little notes, whereon the Reader looks,
Often aid his ouerpressed memory,
Unto the Authors sense where he would be:
So do true Counselors assist good Kings,
And help their Greatness on, with little things.
Honor, in chief, our Oath is to uphold,
That by no traffic it be bought, or sold.
Else look what brings that dainty Throne-worke down;
Adds not, but still takes something from a Crown.
Proffit, and her true Mine, Frugality,
Incident likewise to our Office be:
As husbanding the Scepters spreading right,
To stretch it self, yet not grow infinite;
Or with Prerogative to Tyrannize,
Whose works prove often more absolute, than wise.
Not mastering Laws, which freedom interrupts;
Nor moulding Pulpits, which is to corrupt,
And help Change in; whose vanity still tends
To work immortal things to mortal ends.
But our part is to keep the Justice free,
As equal peising liberality;
Which both contents the People that receives,
And Princely giver more enabled leaves.
Likewise with foreign States we keep respect
By diligence, which seldom findesneglect.
In Treaties still concluding mutual good;
Since no one byas'd Contracteuer stood.
In Complements we strive to hold such measure,
That outward form consume not inward treasure.
For betwixt Man, and Man; 'twixt King and Kings;
Our place should offer well-digested things.
Else as those Crudities, which do remain
Within the body, all Complexions stain:
So does advantage between State, and State,
Though finely got, yet prove unfortunate:
And often Disorder like in government,
Leave even those that prosper, discontent.
But is our great Lords Character like these?
Are disproportioned humors made to please?
Can Parricide, even unto Nature treason,
Draw any true line from, Man's Zenith, Reason?
Then how can Vice, in this confused estate,
Long escape the doom of neuer-sparing Fate?
For, as we see, when sickness deeply roots,
Meat, drink, and drugges alike do little boot;
Because all what should either nurse, or cure,
As mastered by diseases, grow impure:
So when Excess (the malady of Might)
Has ( Dropsy-like) drowned all the styles of right,
Then does Obedience ( else the food of Power)
Help on that dropsy Canker to devour.
In which crazed times, woe worth foreseeing wit,
Which mar it self may, cannot help with it.
For as those Kings that conquer neighbor Nations,
First by the sword make Chaos of Creations;
Then, Spider-like a curious netting spinne,
Invisible, to catch Inferiors in:
So when the Art of powerful Tyranny
Has vndermin'd man's native liberty;
Then, like Lords absolute of words, and deeds,
They soon change weeds to herbs, and herbs to weeds.
Which ouer-winding while the People fear,
Can Tyrants hope of Sanctuary there?
O^^ when this fear has tied Men's minds together,
Proves this a storm, or constant Winter-weather?
Again, when Selfenesse has men's hearts estranged,
Is not one Sovereign soon to many changed?
Lastly, where absolute seems only wise,
Is not one, envious there, in many eyes?
Disease thus grown, the Crisis, and the Doom,
Show Princes must be ours, or we their Tomb.
For as the Ocean, which is ever deep,
Under her smooth face, does in secret keep
The vast content of deaths devouring womb,
Where those desires which venture find a tomb;
AEolus, with sweet breath, making all things fair,
Till he has bound hope Prentise to his air;
Then adding more breath to that breath they spend,
Makes tide with tide, and wave with wave contend?
Enforcing men, for tax, to throw their goods
Into his merciless, entising floods;
Where swallowing some in sight of those he spares,
Even they that prosper best must swarm with cares:
So does vast Power, at first, spread out her slights
Of Grace, and Honor; smooth bewitching bayts;
And when men's Lives, their Goods, and Liberty,
Are left in trust once with her Tyranny;
Then, Ocean-like, blown up with storms of passion,
Which, but excess, makes all seem out of fashion,
It takes aduange to devour the Just,
Because to Laws, that limit Thrones, they trust
Ruins the Wise, whose eye discernes too much,
And thereby brings Powers errors to the touch;
Discards the Learned, for the difference
They make between the truth, and Princes sense;
Stains the Religious, as if they withstood
Powers will, the stamp of all that is current good:
Yet saues it some, that they may witness bear,
Where Power reigns, there Worth must live in fear.
Thus are we Soothers, as all shadows be,
Sworn to the bodies of Authority.
Thus do Inferiors, caught with their own ends,
Pay double use for all the Scepter lends;
Not seeing, while Man strives to stand by Grace,
He offers Natures freedom up to Place;
Whose true relation, between Men, and Might,
Assures us, Thrones should not be infinite,
Lastly, thus do we suffer God to wayne,
Under the Humors of a Sultans reign.
And in the fatal ruin of his Son,
Cut off our own lives, on a less thread spunne.
Achmat solus.

WHo, standing in the shade of humble valleys,
Looks up, and wonders at the state of hills;
When he with toil of weary limbs ascends,
And feels his spirits melt with Phoebus glories,
Or sinews stark with AEolus bitter breathing,
Or thunder-blasts, which coming from the sky,
Do fall most heavy on the places high:
Then knows (though farther seen, and farther seeing
From hills above, than from the humble valleys)
They multiply in woes, that add in glories.
Who weary is of Natures quiet Plains,
A mean estate, with poor, and chaste desires;
Whose Virtue longs for knees, Bliss for opinion;
Who judges pleasures Paradise in purple;
Let him see me: No Governor of Castile,
No petty Princes choice, whose weak dominions
Make weak, unnoble Counsels to be current:
But Bassha unto Solomon; whose scepter,
Nay servants, have dominion over Princes:
Under whose feet, the four forgotten Monarchs,
The footstooles lie of his eternal glory:
Even I thus raised, this Solymans beloved,
Thus carried up by fortune to be tempted,
Must, for my Princes sake, destroy Succession,
Or suffer ruin to preserve Succession.
Oh happy Men! that know not, or else fear
This second slippery place of Honors steep,
Which we with envy get, and danger keep.
Unhappy state of ours! wherein we live,
Where doubts give laws, which never can forgive:
Where Rage of Kings not only ruins be,
But where their very love works misery.
For Princes humors are not like the Glass,
Which in it shows what shapes without remain,
And with the body go, and come again:
But like the Wax, which first bears but his own,
Till it the seal in easy mould receive,
And by the impression only then is known.
In this soft weakness Rossa prints her art,
And seeks to toss the Crown from hand to hand;
Kings are not safe whom any understand.
First, of her self, she durst send Rosten forth
To murder Mustapha, his dearest Son:
He found him only guarded with his worth,
Suspecting nothing, and yet nothing done.
Rosten is now returned: For wicked fear
Did even make him wickedness forbear.
A Beglerbie goes since to call him hither;
The Color, war against the Persian King;
The Truth, to suffer force of Tyranny,
From his enforced Fathers Jealousy.
Who vtters this, is to his Prince a Traitor:
Who keeps this, Guilty is; his life is ruth,
And dying lives, ever denying truth.
Thus has the Fancy-law of Power ordained,
That who betrays it most, is most esteemed:
Who says it is betrayed, is Traitor deemed.
I sworn am to my King, and to his Honor:
His Humors? No: which they, that follow most,
Wade in a Sea, wherein themselves are lost.
Yet Achmat stay! For who does wrest Kings minds,
Wrestles his faith upon the stage of Chance;
Where virtue, to the world by fortune known,
Is often misiudg'd, because she is overthrown.
Nay Achmat stay not! For who truth enuirons
With circumstances of Man's failing wit,
By fear, by hope, by love, by malice erreth;
Nature to natures banckrupts he engages:
And while none dare show Kings they go amiss,
Even base Obedience their Corruption is.
Then Fear! dwell with the ill; Truth is assured:
Opinion! be, and reign with Fortunes Princes.
Policy! go piece the faults of Mortal Kingdoms.
Death! threaten them that live to die for ever,
I first am Natures subject, then my Princes;
I will not serve to Innocencies ruin.
Whose Heaven is Earth, let them believe in Princes.
My God is not the God of subtle murder:
Solomon shall know the truth: I look no further.
Behold! he comes like Majesty confused;
Horror, Revenge, Rage lighten in his eyes.
All Laws give place where Power is joined with these;
And he must go beyond that will appease.
Solomon. Achmat.

Mercy, and Love! you Phrases popular,
Which undermine, and limit Princes Thrones,
Go, seek the regions of Equality.
Greatness must keep those Arts by which it grew,
And ever what it wills, or fears, make true.

My Lord! what moves these undermining words,
Which showing fear in you, stir fear in us?
Cruelty, and Dissolution enter thus.

Does Kings restraint of wrath appear like fear?
Shall our remissness suffer more than this?
Can horror only, adoration bear?
Behold, the World lays Homage at my feet,
To them by sword, and fire I am known:
Must Kings that change this likeness lose their own?
Two States I bear; his Father, and his King;
These two, being Relatiues, have mutual bonds;
Neglect in either, all in question brings.
My Son climes up with wings of seeming Merit;
His course, Applause; and mine, the scale of Order;
By Dissolution, he builds up Content;
And I displease, by planting Government.
My Age spends on the stock of Honor won;
Flesh has her buds, her flowers, her fruit, her fall;
Work has his time, and Rest is natural:
His Youth has hope for right; and Fame for end;
Time for a stage; for rival Expectation;
Ascending by the balance we descend.
Let Youth affect goodwill, praise, reputation,
Fashion it self to Times, or Times to it,
Grow strong, and rich in man's imagination:
But when her Fame reflects scorn upon Kings,
Her glory undermines, or else confounds
Of Place, Time, Nature, all the reverend bounds.
These crooked shadows no straight bodies have;
Practice, Ambition, Pride, are here disguised.
And shall Love be a chain, tied to my Crown,
Either to help him up, or pull me down?
No, No: This Father-language fits not Kings,
" Whose public, universal providence
" Of Things, not Persons, always must have sense.
With Justice I these misty doubts will clear.
And he that breaks divine, and humane Law,
Shall no protection out of either draw.

Sir! where corrupted limbs Art does divide,
It has no name of torment, but of cure:
Let many perish, so the State be sure.

Then Achmat! Bid the Eunuchs do their charge.
I wound my self in wounding of my Son;
A Kings estates has of a Fathers won.
Aduantagious Ambition! have thou learned
That present Government still gives offenses,
And long life in the best Kings discontenteth?
That discontentments hopes live in succession?
Well! False desires (which in false Glasses show
That Princes Thrones are like enchanted fires,
Mighty to see, and easy to pass over:)
By Mustapha's example, learn to know;
No private thoughts can sound Authority.
Achmat! I mean that Mustapha shall die.

My Lord! Good Fortune does me witness bear,
That my hopes need not stand upon Succession,
Where life is poor in all, but woe, and fear:
Then Sir! doubt not my faith, though I withstand
This fearful Counsel, which you have in hand.

Resolved I am. The form alone I doubt.
Envy, and Murmur I desire to shun,
With which yet great Examples must be done.

The form of proof precedes the form of death;
Kings honors, and their safeties live in both:
Against these to give counsel I am loath.

Thought is with God an Act: Kings cannot see
Th'intents of mischief, but with Jealousy.

In what protection then lives Innocence?

Below the danger of Omnipotence.

Are thoughts, and deeds confounded any where?

In Princes lives, that may not suffer fear.
Where Place unequal equally is weighed,
There Power supreme is balanced, not obeyed.

This is the way to make Accusers proud,
And feed up starued Spite with guiltless blood.

A just advantage unto Kings allowed,
Whose safeties do include a common good.

Sir! I confess, where one man rules all,
There fear, and care are secret ways of wit;
Where All may rise, and only One must fall,
There Pride aspires, and Power must master it:
For worlds repine at those, whom Birth, or Chance,
Above all men, and yet but Men, advance.
I know when easy hopes do nurse desire,
The Deadmen only of the Wise are trusted:
And though crook'd Fear do seldom rightly measure,
As thinking all things, but it self, dissembled:
Yet Solomon! let Fear awake Kings counsels.
But fear not Natures laws, which seldom alter,
Nor rare examples of iniquity,
Which, but with age, of time delivered be:
Fear false Stepmothers rage, Woman's ambition,
Whereof each Age to other is a Glass;
Fear them that fear not, for desire, shame;
Selling their faiths to bring their ends to pass.
Establish Rossa's children for your heirs;
Let Mustapha's hopes fall; translate his right:
And when her proud Ambitions glutted be,
Straight Envy dies; Fear will appear no more:
Nature takes on the shape it had before.

Shall Error escape by Art? And shall a bare
Stepmothers name, in her that speaks truth,
Disguise, and shadow Parricide from blame?
Intents are seeds, and actions they include.
Princes, whose Scepters must be feared of many,
Are never safe that live in fear of any

Tyrants they are that punish out of fear,
States wiser than the truth decline, and wear.

Thou art but one. The rest, in whom I trust,
Discern his fault, and urge me to be just.

Though Factions strength be great, her slight is more;
Her plots, and instruments inlay'd with Art:
Less care has Truth than has the evil part.

Traitor! Must I doubt all to credit thee?

No less is Truth, where Kings deceived will be.

The greater number holds the safest parts.

That one is but the least of Factions arts.

Thy counsel hazards all: Their course but one.

That painted hazard is but made the Gate,
For ruin of your Son to enter at.
Truth must the measure be to slave, and King.

Shall Power then lose her odds in any thing?

God, even to himself, has made a law.

He does for Fame, what Kings do but for awe.
What, but Desert, makes those that praise accuse?

The Virtue they admire, and cannot use.

Dare ought, but Truth, assail a Princes child?

On Princes frailties Factions ever build.

Speak plain, and free my soul from this disease,
That with the ruin of mine own would please.

That which you will not feel, how can you see?
For in your love these works were all inweau'd;
With which most worthy men are most deceived.

What King, or Man, loves fear, wrong, treachery?
These be the things that now in question be.

Sir! where Kings doubt, Wisdom, and Laws provide,
Due trial, and restraint of liberty,
And unto Caution their estate is tied:
But where Kings Rage becomes superlatiue,
There people do forbear, but not forgive.
My Lord! then stay: Delays are wisdom, where
Time may more easy ways of safetye show.
Selfe-murther is an ugly work of fear;
And little less is Childrens overthrow.
Mustapha is yours; more Sir! even he
Is not, for whom you Mustapha or'ethrow.
Suspicious common to Successions be;
Honor, and Fear together ever go.
Who must kill all they fear, fear all they see,
Nor Subjects, Sons, nor Neighborhood can bear:
So infinite the limits be of Fear.

Well Achmat! Stay. I strive to rest my thoughts.
Words rather stir, than quiet fixed impressions.
Kings hearts must judge what Subjects hearts have wrought,
Not your calm heart vnthreat'ned, and upright.
Such Bees fetch home from the self same Flower,
Whence Spiders draw their deep enuenom'd power.
No, No: Experience wounded is the School,
Where man ^^arnes piercing wisdom out of smart;
Innocence includes the serpent, not the fool.
The wager's great of being, or not being.
These Crudities let me within digest;
My Power shall take upon it all the rest.

Camena. Solomon. Achmat.

They that from youth do suck at Fortunes breast,
And nurse their empty hearts with seeking higher,
" Like Dropsie-fedde, their thirst does never rest;
" For still, by getting, they beget desire:
" Till thoughts, like Wood, while they maintain the Flame
" O^ high desires, grow Ashes in the same.
" But Virtue! Those that can behold thy beauties,
" Those that suck, from their youth, thy milk of Goodness,
" Their minds grow strong against the storms of fortune,
" And stand, like rocks, in Winter gusts unshaken;
" Not with the blindness of desire mistaken.
O Virtue therefore! whose thrall I think fortune,
Thou who despisest not the sex of Women,
Help me out of these Riddles of my fortune,
Wherein (meethinks) you with your self do pose me:
Let Fates go on: sweet Virtue! do not lose me.
My Mother, and my Husband have conspired,
For Brothers good, the ruin of my Brother:
My Father by my Mother is inspired,
For one child to seek ruin of another.
I that to help by Nature am required,
While I do help, must needs still hurt a Brother.
While I see who conspire, I seem conspired
Against a Husband, Father, and a Mother,
Truth bids me run, by Truth I am retired;
Shame leads me both the one way, and the other.
In what a Labyrinth is Honor cast,
Drawn diverse ways with Sex, with Time, with State?
In all which, Errors course is infinite,
By hope, by fear, by spite, by love, and hate;
And but one only way unto the right.
A thorny way: where Pain must be the guide;
Danger the light; Offense of Power the praise:
Such are the golden hopes of Iron days.
Yet Virtue, I am thine, for thy sake grieved
( Since basest thoughts, for their ill-plac'd desires,
In shame, in danger, death, and torment glory)
That I cannot with more pains write thy story.
Chance therefore! if thou scornest those that scorn thee;
Fame! if thou hate those that force thy Trumpet
To sound aloud, and yet despise thy sounding;
Laws! if you love not those that be examples
Of Natures laws, whence you are fallen corrupted;
Conspire that I, against you all conspired,
Joined with Tyrant Virtue, as you call her,
That I, by your reuenges may be named,
For Virtue, to be ruined, and defamed,
My mother often, and diversely I warned,
What Fortunes were upon such courses builded:
That fortune still must be with ill maintained,
Which at the first with any ill is gained.
I Rosten warned, that man's selfe-louing thought
Still creeps to the rude embracing might
Of Princes grace: a Lease of glories let,
Which shining burns; breeds Serens when it is set.
And, by this creature of my mothers making,
This messenger, I Mustapha have warned,
That Innocence is not enough to save,
Where Good, and Greatness, Fear, and Envy have.
Till now, in reverence I have forborne
To ask, or to presume to guess, or know
My Fathers thoughts; where of he might think scorn:
For dreadful is that Power that all may do;
Yet they, that all men fear, are fearful too.
Lo where he sits! Virtue! work thou in me,
That what thou seek may accomplished be.

Ah Death! Is not thy self sufficient anguish,
But thou must borrow Fear, that threatening Glass,
Which, while it goodness hides, and mischief shows,
Does lighten Wit to honors overthrows?
But hushed: Meethinks away Camena steals:
Murder, belike, in me it self reueales.
Camena! Whither now? Why haste you from me?
Is it so strange a thing to be a Father?
Or is it I that am so strange a Father?

My Lord! Meethought, nay, sure I saw you busy:
Your Child presumes, vncall'd, that comes unto you.

Who may presume with Fathers, but their own,
Whom Natures law has ever in protection,
And guilds in good belief of dear affection?

Nay, Reverence, Sir! So Childrens worth does hide,
As of the Fathers it is least espide.

I think its true: Who know their children least,
Have greatest reason to esteem them best.

How so my Lord? Since Love in Knowledge lives,
Which unto strangers therefore no man gives.

The life we gave them soon they do forget,
While they think our lives do their fortunes let.

The tenderness of life it is so great,
As any sign of death we hate too much
And unto Parents Sons, perchance, are such.
Yet Nature meant her strongest unity,
Twixt Sons, and Fathers; making Parents cause
Unto the Sons, of their humanity;
And Children pledge of their eternity.
Fathers should love this Image in their Sons.

But streams back to their springs do never run.

Pardon my Lord! Doubt is Successions foe:
Let not her mists poor Children overthrow.
Though streams from springs do see me to run away,
' It Is Nature leads them to their Mother Sea.

Does Nature teach them, in Ambitions strife,
To seek his death, by whom they have their life?

Things easy, to desire impossible do seem:
Why should fear make impossible seem easy?

Monsters yet be; and being are believed.

Incredible has some inordinate progression:
Blood, Doctrine, Age, corrupting Liberty,
Do all concur, where men such monsters be.
Pardon me Sir! if Duty do seem angry:
Affection must breathe out afflicted breath,
Where imputation has such easy faith.

Mustapha is he that has defiled his nest;
The wrong the greater, for I Iou'd him best.
He has devised that all at once should die,
Rosten, and Rossa, Zanger, thou, and I.

Fall none but Angels suddenly to hell?
Are Kind, and Order grown precipitate?
Did ever any other man, but he,
In instant lose the use of doing well?
Sir! these be mists of Greatness. Look again:
For Kings, that, in their fearful icie State,
Behold their children, as their winding sheet,
Do easily doubt; and what they doubt, they hate.

Camena! Thy sweet Youth, that knows no ill,
Cannot believe thine Elders, when they say,
That good belief is great Estates decay.
Let it suffice, that I, and Rossa too,
Are privy what your Brother means to do.

Sir! Pardon me: and nobly as a Father,
What I shall say, and say of holy Mother,
Know I shall say it, but to right a Brother.
My Mother is your Wife: Duty in her
Is love: She loves; which not well governed, bears
The evil Angel of misgiuing Fears;
Whose many eyes, whilst but it self they see,
Still make the worst of possibility:
Out of this Fear she Mustapha accuses:
Unto this Fear, perchance, she ioynes the Love,
Which does in Mothers, for their Children move.
Perchance, when Fear has showed her yours must ^all,
In Love she sees that hers must rise withal.
Sir! Fear a frailty is, and may have grace,
And ouer-care of you cannot be blamed;
Care of our own in Nature has a place;
Passions are often mistaken, and misnamed;
Things simply good grow evil with misplacing.
Though laws cut off, and do not care to fashion,
Humanity of error has compassion.
Yet God forbid, that either Fear, or Care,
Should ruin those that true, and faultlesse are,

Is it no fault, or fault I may forgive,
For Son to seek the Father should not live?

Is it a fault, or fault for you to know,
My Mother doubts a thing that is not so?
These ugly works of monstrous Parricide,
Mark from what hearts they rise, and where they bide.
Violent, despayr'd, where honor broken is;
Fear lord; Time Death; where Hope is Misery;
Doubt having stopped all honest ways to bliss,
And Custom shut the windows up of shame,
That Craft may take upon her Wisdoms name.
Compare now Mustapha with this despair:
Sweet Youth, sure Hopes, Honor, a Fathers love,
No infamy to move, or banish fear,
Honor to stay, hazard to hasten fate:
Can horrors work in such a Childs estate?
Besides, the Gods, whom Kings should imitate,
Have placed you high to rule, not overthrow;
For us, not for your selves, is your Estate:
Mercy must hand in hand with Power go.
Your Scepter should not strike with arms of fear,
Which fathoms all men's imbecillitie,
And Mischief does, left it should mischief bear.
As reason deals within with frailty,
Which kills not passions that rebellious are,
But adds, substracts, keeps down ambitious spirits;
So must Power form, not ruin instruments:
For flesh and blood, the means twixt heaven, and hell,
Unto extremes extremely racked be;
Which Kings in Art of Government should see.
Else they, which circle in themselves with death,
Poison the air, wherein they draw their breath.
Pardon my Lord! Pity becomes my Sex:
Grace with delay grows weak, and fury wise.
Remember Theseus wish, and Neptunes haste.
Killed Innocence, and left Succession waste.

If what were best for them that do offend
Laws did inquire, the answer must be, Grace.
If Mercy be so large, where is Justice place?

Where Love despaires, and where Gods promise ends.
For Mercy is the highest reach of wit,
A safety unto them that save with it:
Borne out of God, and unto humane eyes,
Like God, not seen, till fleshly passion dies.

God may forgive, whose being, and whose harms
Are far removed from reach of fleshly arms:
But if God Equals, or Successors had;
Even God, of safe reuenges would be glad.

While he is yet alive, he may be slain;
But from the dead no flesh comes back again.

While he remains alive, I live in fear.

Though he were dead, that doubt still living were.

None has the power to end what he begun.

The same occasion follows every Son.

Their Greatness, or their Worth is not so much.

And shall the best be slain, for being such?

Thy Mother, or thy Brother are amiss:
I am betrayed; and one of them it is.

My Mother, if she errres, erres virtuously;
And let her err, ere Mustapha should die.
Kings, for their safety, must not blame mistrust;
Nor, for surmises, sacrifice the just.

Well: dear Camena! keep this secretly:
I will be well advised before he die.
Come Achmat! to the Church: we will go pray
God, to unfold this probability,
Where Power, and Wit so much offend him may.
In this disease of spirits, the true Appeal
Is to that Judge that every spirit knows;
For we by Error else may honor lose.
His laws, the life, the Innocence, the State
Of Son, and Father now in balance stand.
Kings that have cause to fear, take leave to hate;
Sons, that aspire, as easly lift their hands.
If I fall now, I give that scope to face,
Our equal gage being only Natures bands.
Help comes alike to each of us too late,
If ought between us, and advantage stand.
Yet she, and you, a strife within me move,
And rest I will with counsel from above.

IF among Christians, even the best Divines
Conclude, their Church (though thrall to humane might)
Yet to be such a fair mould, as refines
And guides Kings power, else indefinite,
That it no Tyrant, or Prophaner be;
Horrors too frequent in Authority:
May not our conquering true Church then assume,
By Grace, and Duty, to link God to Kings,
And Kings to Man? which what else could presume?
Since Might, and Number, rule all other things.
Then Crowns! what Honor to our Church is due,
That fashions it self thus, to fashion you?
Laws we had none, but what our Priests inspired;
Our right was less; for we had naught to claim:
To propagate it self the Truth defir'd,
And to that end, at all mankind did aim:
So that while Souls we only sought to save,
They are with God, and we their Empires have.
Olli, a Prophet from our Church divided
In outward forms, not lines of inward life,
Like witty Schism, we lovingly decided,
With well-bent spirits in opinions strife.
Europe in chief our Prophets then withstood,
With her three-Mitred God of flesh, and blood.
Her lett'red Greece, that Lottarie of Arts,
Since Mars forsook her subtle, never wise;
Proud of her new-made Gods in fleshly hearts,
As she of old was of her Heathen lies;
We undertook with unity of mind,
And what their Wits dispute, our Swords did bind.
So that ere her gross Sects could danger see,
Their Thrones, Schools, Miters, Idols were resigned
To us, new Trophies of our Monarchy:
Thus are the Muses still by Mars refined:
And thus our Church, by pulling others down,
I fear or'ebuilt it self, perchance the Crown.
For, till of late, our Church and Prince were one,
No latitude left either to divide:
The Word, and Sword endeavored not alone,
But were, like mutual Voice, and Echo, tide
With one desire jointly to move, speak, do;
As if Fates Oracles, and Actors too.
Now while the Crown, and Priesthood joined thus
In equal Ends, though Dignities distinct,
As man's soul to his body linked is:
Crowns, by this tincture of Divine instinct,
So above Nature raised the Laws of Might,
As made all errors of the world our right.
Vices, I grant, our Martial course then had;
For spoil, blood, lust, were therein left too free,
As raising strong Idea's in the Bad,
Brave instruments of Sovereignty.
Like Thieves, at home our Justice was severe;
In other Princes Realms our freedoms were.
Great the Seraglia was, I must confess,
Yet so, as kindle did, not quench our spirits:
Our pleasures never made our natures less;
Venus was joined with Mars, to stir up merits.
In right, or wrong our Course was not precise,
Nor is, in any State that multiplies.
Yet, to redeem this Discipline of Vice,
We added to the glory of our State;
Won honor by them, to the prejudice
Of Strangers, conquering more than we did hate:
Our Emulation was with Crowns, not Men;
Thus did our Vices spread our Empire then.
Where since, though we still spoil that Christian Sect,
Which, by division fatal to their kind,
Friends, duties, enemies, and right neglect,
To keep up some Selfe-humor in the wind;
Yet all we thus win, not by force, but slight,
Poys'd with our Martial Conquests, will lack weight.
For Force, not Right, our Crescents bear in Chief;
Camps, and not Courts, are Mappes of our Estate,
Where Church, Law, Will, all Discipline in brief,
Established are to make Worth fortunate:
We scorn those Arts of Peace, that Civil Tether,
Which, in one bond, tie Craft, and Force together.
Of Cell-bred Sciences we chew no cudde;
Our Food and Garments ouerloade us not;
When one Act withers, straight another buddes;
Our Rest is doing; good success our Lot;
Our Beasts are no more delicate than we:
This odds have Turks of Christianity.
Yet by your traffike with this dreaming Nation,
Their Conquered Vice has stain'dour Conquering State,
And brought thin Cobwebs into reputation
Of tender Subtlety; whose stepmother Fate
So inlayes Courage with ill shaddowing Fear,
As makes it much more hard to do, than bear.
And as in Circles, who breaks any part,
That perfect form does utterly confound:
Or as amongst the feigned lines of Art,
One only Right is, all else Crooked found:
So from our Prophets Sawes when Sultans stray,
In humane Wit Power finds perplexed way.
Hence, though we make no Idols, yet we fashion
God, as if from Powers Throne he took his being;
Our Alchoran as warrant unto passion;
Monarchs in all laws but their own will seeing.
He whom God chooses out of doubt does well:
What they that choose their God do, who can tell?
Again, when Great States learn Ciuility
Of petty Kingdoms, learn they not to fall?
Nay Monarchies, when they declining be,
Brook they those Virtues which they rose withal?
Had Mustapha been borne in Selims time,
What now is Fearful, then had been Sublime.
The Christian bondage is much more refined,
Though not in real Things, in real Names,
Laws, Doctrine, Discipline, being all assigned
To hold upright that witty Man-built frame;
Where every limb, though in themselves distinct,
Yet finely are unto the Scepter linckt.
An Art by which Man seems, but is not free;
Crowns keeping all their specious guiding reins,
Fast in the hand of strong Authority;
So to relax, or wind up Passions chains,
As before humble people know their grief,
Their states are used to look for no relief.
Yet if by parts we travail to compare,
What differences 'twixt these two Empires are:
We buildno Cittadells, our Strengths are Men,
And hold Retreit to be the Losers den:
They, by their Forts, mow their own People down;
A way perchance to keep, not spread a Crown.
Of bondage we leave our Succession free;
Office, and Action, are our liberty.
They may inherit Land; we hope for Place:
They give the Wealthy; we the Active grace.
We hear the fault, and so demand that Head,
Which has in Martial duties been mislead:
Their process is to answer, and appear;
But under Laws, which hold the Scepter dear.
Our Law is Martial, sudden, and severe;
For Fact can rarely intricatenesse bear:
Their Laws take life from Sovereignty,
Thanklesse to which, Power will not let them be.
So that the Mussell-man sends home his head;
The Christian keeps his own, till he be dead.
Our trade is Tax, comprising Men, and Things:
And draw not they Mankindes wealth under Kings?
Soothing the Tyrant, till by his excess,
Want makes the Majesty of Thrones grow less,
By taxing Peoples Vice at such a rate,
As to fill up a Sieve, exhausts a State:
Lastly; so shuffling Trade, Law, Doctrine, Will,
As no soul shall find peace in good, or ill;
Both being Trappes alike used, to entice
The weak, and humble into prejudice.
Our Sultans rule their charge by Prophets Sawes,
And leave the Mufti Judge of all their Laws:
The Christians take, and change Faith with their Kings,
Which under Miters often the Scepter brings.
We make the Church our Sultans instrument:
They with their Kings will make their Church content.
They wrangle with themselves, and by dispute
In questions, think to make the one side mute:
If not, then sacrifice the weaker part;
As if, in Thrones, blood were Religions Art;
Forcing the will, which is to catch the wind,
As if man's Nature were more than his mind:
We in subduing Christians conquer both,
And to lose use of either part are loath.
So that we suffer their fond zeal to pray,
That it may well our conquering armies pay.
And where we are, there Christians feign would be,
If lack of Power were not their modesty.
Thus do all Great States safely manage things,
Which danger seems to Thrones of petty Kings.
For though the Sick have sense of every breath,
And shun all what they feel, for fear of death:
Yet in strong States, those storms they feel give health,
And by their Purgings spoil Infections stealth;
A play of Sunne-motes, from man's small World come,
Upon the great World to work heavy doom.
For proof: Behold in Solomon that fear,
Which Torrid Zones of Tyranny must bear.
For who has lost man's Nature in his passion,
Can never see the World in better fashion:
But credit gives to limitlesse Suspicion,
Which unto all vice gives one Condition,
Confusions Orb; where men may hate their own,
Nature, and Reason there being overthrown.
Hence go out Mandates of conspiracy
Against Mustapha, who must not guiltless be
In such a Father, and a Monarchs eyes,
As will see nothing, but destruction, wise.
Hence Mustapha, from like dreams of the heart,
Sees his destruction wrought by Tyrants Art,
And yet yields things to names; his right to passion;
Which misplaced duties help Power to disfashion.
Nay, hence Mankind, by crafty power oppressed,
Where it has given part, still gives the rest;
And thinking Thrones in all their practice true,
Dare not of their own Creatures ask their due:
But rather, like mild Earth with Weeds or'egrowne,
Yields to be plough'd, manured, and overthrown.
Lastly, thus Scepters fall with their own weight,
When climing Power, once risen to her height,
Descends to make distinction in her lust,
Which grants that absolute may be unjust;
And so subjects to censure what should reign;
Steps to bring Power to People back again.
Whence I conclude: Mankind is both the Form,
And Matter, wherewith Tyrannies transform:
For Power can neither see, work, or devise,
Without the Peoples hands, hearts, wit, and eyes:
So that were Man not by himself oppressed,
Kings would not, Tyrants could not make him beast.
Rossa. Rosten.

O wearysome Obedience, Wax to Power!
Shall I in vain be Mustapha's accuser?
Shall any Justice equal him and me?
Is Love so open-ear'd; my power so weak,
As ought against me to my Lord dare speak?
" Sands shall be numbered first and Motion fixed,
" The Sea exchange her channel with the fire,
" Before my will, or reason stand in awe
" Of God, or Nature, common Peoples law.

Rossa! whence grows this strange unquiet motion?
Govern your thoughts. What want you to content you,
That have the King of Kings at your devotion?

Content? O poor estate of Woman's Wit!
The latitude of Princes is Desire,
Which all, it has enjoyed, still carries higher.
Say you the World is left to my devotion?
Who questioned am both in my State, and Fame,
Must lose my Will, and cannot lose my Shame:
For Mustapha, long since condemned to die,
Now lives again.
To boast of marriage then what ground have I?

Conclude not now: For Thoughts that be offended.
Are seldom with their present visions mended.
Rage sees too much; Security too little;
Affections are, like glassy metal brittle.

Ah servile Sex! must Yokes our honor be,
To make our own loves our captivity?
No Rossa, no: look not in Languisht Wit,
For none can stand on Fortunes steep with it.
" Think Innocence harm; Virtue dishonor;
" Wound Truth; and ouerweigh the scale of Right:
Sexes have ways apart; States have their fashions:
The virtues of Authority are Passions.

Rossa! Take heed.
Your Honors, like Kings humors, brittle are,
Which broken once, repayr'd can hardly be;
And these once stained, what is Humanity?
Rossa! first judge your Ends, and then your Means.
You seek to undermine a Princes State,
Deep rooted in by Time, Power, Reverence;
Established on Succession fortunate
Of many Turks: from men that servile be,
Use having lost the use of Liberty.
I understand a Monarchs State too well,
To bid you purchase Peoples idle breath,
That have no power of Honor, Life, or Death:
These ways are wrong, uncertain, fearful too,
In absolutes, which all themselves will do.
But turn your eyes up to the will of one;
Know you must work a Father from his Son.

This Parents dotage, as it weakness is,
So works it with the vigor of disease,
Still undermining with the things that please.
Upon this Quick-sand what can be begun?

Sons love with self-love must be overthrown
By force of Natures law there is nothing won.
Strifes in the Fathers mind you must beget,
And him above his sweet affections bear,
To take impressions both of hope, and fear.

Those silly natures apt to louingnesse,
Which ever must in others power live,
With Doubt become more fond, with Wrong more thral:
Fear here wants eyes, Hate has no sting at all.

All these false Strengths of native Confidence,
With their Excess, have their Inconstancy:
The laws of Kind, with Tyrants, nothing be.
Besides, dear Rossa! Ills have such alliance,
As in what subject any one is grown,
The seeds of all, even in that one, are sown.

This mass of Passions who can deal withal?
Too nice, and subtle is Inconstancy.
Shall Wrong faire-written still in Patience be?
Must my desire so many Cautions have,
And wait on those thoughts that have worshipped me?
I cannot bear this Mediocrity.

Rossa! Take heed. Extremes are not the means,
To change Estates, either in good, or ill.
Therefore yield not; since that makes Nature less:
Nor yet use Rage, which vainly drives on
The mind to working without instruments:
Besides, it does make partial our intents,
Discredits Truth, condemns indifferent things.
But take upon you quiet Providence,
The Princes State, with his Authority;
Teach Power to doubt; for Doubt is her defense.
Degrees of Passions, as of Spirits there be;
Choose now for Use, and not for Dignity.
Love spreads the wit to play, but not to arm,
Has many feet to walk an easy pace,
Slow to mistrust, and never apt to harm:
But fear of Credit is within the mind,
Strengthened by Nature with the strength of all;
In Men, and Tyrants states both, natural.
The Project of this fear must yet be made
The Princes safety, Honor of the State:
Such glorious Styles may easily ouershade
The ways of Spite; for Treason is in hate.
Flattery straight speaks aloud in Powers right,
Carrying things under names, Truth under might.
" Who dare distinguish in a Tyranny,
" Where fraud it self has Powers authority?
" Who shall correct Errors, made for the King,
" But Kings themselves; who Actors in their fears,
" Most honor those that most suspicion bring.
" Who there sees Right, or dare use Honors name,
" Where both are sure of death, and doubtful fame?
Then Rossa! plant you here; accuse the Son;
Although you fail his death, you need not doubt:
In Tyrants state never was man undone
By miscomplaints. Besides, what comes about
In earth, but it has lets, and finds delays?
Yield not: but multiply malice in patience;
Honor is only form, form Tyrants ways.
Accuse his Friends, speak doubtful, charge, and praise.
Put Truth to silence: People dare not see
The pride of Power in formal Tyranny.
I know my time; the Bassha's how they bend;
Faction still wakes; and Competence has spite;
It Is fault enough that Achmat is his friend;
His lightness, and his power well understood.
Things may so pass as Mustapha may die,
Ere Counsel, or Remorce put Fury by.
But if Extremity chance to require
A more audacious Figure; then use Rage:
It give sometimes an Honor to desire;
It shows a Plainness, credible to Age:
While it is ruled, it may have time, and place;
But if it rule, in prophesies disgrace.

I feel my heart now rise; my spirits work;
Confused thoughts all words have ouergrowne,
When Mustapha is dead, what Star has motion,
But Achmat; in whom Solomon yet trusts?
They who their Ends, by Change, strive to advance,
Must never doubt to go the way of Chance.

Achmat is wise, and Solymans beloved:
Even Tyrants covet to uphold their fame;
Not fearing evil Deeds, but evil Name.

When Childrens blood the Fathers forehead stains,
What privilege for Counselors remains?

What arguments against him?

Use of killing;
Suspicion, the favorite of Tyrants;
Delight of Change; Favors past; and fear of Greatness,
Sharp'ned by Achmats harsh, and open dealing,
Which mighty Tyrants liberty would draw
Into the narrow scope of humane Law.

Let Mustapha be dead.

how dead while Achmat reigns?
Down is the Idol, but the Workmanliues:
His favor, virtue, reputation, course,
To us are still that Mustapha, or worse.
Then down he must, and shall. My chiefest End
Is, first to fix this World on my Succession;
Next so to alter, plant, remove, create,
That I, not he, may fashion this Estate.

Beglerbie. Rossa. Rosten.

Rossa, and Rosten! while you stand debating
The joys, or sorrows of your private Fortunes,
Some evil Angel does traduce you both.
Achmat is called for: Wit, Art, Spite he has;
And while for Sons with Fathers men entreat,
Affection makes each good appearance great.

Rosten! make haste: go hence, and carry with thee
My life, fame, malice, fortune, and desire:
For which, set all established things on fire.
You ugly Ange^ls of the infernal Kingdoms!
You who most bravely have maintained your beings
In equal power, like Rival, to the heavens!
Let me reign, while I live, in my desires;
Or dead, live with you in eternal fires.

Ross^! Not words, but deeds please Hell, or Heaven:
I fear to tell; I tremble to conceal;
Fortune, unto the death, is then displeased,
When remedies do ruin the diseased.

Use not these Parables of coward Fear:
Fear hurts less when it strikes, than when it threatens.

If Mustapha shall die, his death miscarries
Part of thy end, thy Fame, thy Friends, thy Joy:
Who will, to hurt his foes, himself destroy?

My self? What is it else but my desire?
My Brother, Father, Mother, and my God,
Are but those steps which help me to aspire.
Mustapha had never truer friend than I,
That would not with him live, but with him die.
Yet tell: What is the worst?

Camena must, with him, a Traitor be;
Or Mustapha, for her sake, must be free.

O cruel Fates! that do in Love plant Woe,
And in ^elights make our Disasters grow.
But speak: What has she done?

Undone thy doing.
Discovered unto Mustapha his danger:
And from these relikes, I do more than doubt,
Her confidence brings Solomon about.

Nay, black Auernus! so I do adore thee,
As I lament my Womb has been so barren,
To yield but one to offer up before thee.
Who thinks the Daughters death can Mothers stay
From ends, whereon a Woman's heart is fixed,
Weighs harmless Nature, without passion mixed.

Is Mother by the woman overthrown?

Rage knows no Kin: Power is above the Law,
And must not curious be of base Respect,
Which only they command that do neglect.

Your Child's death angers him whom you must please.

My ends are great: Small things are wrought with ease.

This plants confusion in the Powers above.

My end is not to quiet, but to move.

God plagues Injustice in so great excess.

The doing minds feel not that idleness.

What if this Work prove not conspiracy,
But care, that with all duties may agree?

It Is private Fortune that is built on Truth:
Justice is but of great Estates the youth.

Yet by the Love of Mothers to their Children,
By all the pains of travail, so well known,
Punish, but yet spare life; It is your own.

I do protest no Terrors, no Desires,
Glories of fame, nor Rumors injuries,
Could, in a Mothers heart, have quenched the fire
Of loving kindness, to her children borne:
It conquered is with nothing, but with scorn.
I am resolved to move the wheels of Fate.
Her Triumph shall be pain; her Glory shame:
Horror is of excess a just reward:
The giuers of example have regard.

TIME.

WHat mean these mortal children of mine own,
Ungratefully, against me to complain,
That all I build is by me overthrown?
Vices put under to rise up again?
That on my wheels both Good, and Ill do move;
The one beneath, while the other is above?
Day, Night, Hours, Arts, All; God, or Men create,
The world does charge me, that I restless change;
Suffer no being in a constant state:
Alas! Why are my revolutions strange
Unto these Natures, made to fall, or clime,
With that sweet Genius, euer-mouing Time?
What Weariness; what loathsome Desolations
Would plague these life and death-begetting Creatures?
Nay what absurdity in my Creations
Were it, if Time-borne had Eternal features;
This nether Orb, which is Corruptions Sphere,
Not being able long one shape to bear.
Could Pleasure live? Could Worth have reverence?
Laws, Arts, or Sects (mere probabilities)
Keep up their reputation in Man's sense,
If Novelty did not renew his eyes;
Or Time take mildly from him what he knew,
Making both me, and mine, to each still new?
Daughter of Heaven am I; but God, none greater;
Pure like my Parents; life, and death of Action;
Author of ill success to every creature;
Whose pride against my Periods makes a faction:
With me who go along, rise while they be;
Nothing of mine respects Eternity.
Kings! why do you then blame me, whom I choose,
As my Anointed, from the Potters oar;
And to advance you made the People lose,
While you to me acknowledged your power?
Be confident all Thrones subsist in me:
I am the measure of Felicity.
Mahomet in vain, one Trophee of my might,
Raised by my changed aspect to other Nations,
Strives to make his Succession infinite,
And rob my wheels of growth, state, declination.
But he, and all else, that would master Time,
In mortal Spheres, shall find my power sublime.
I bring the Truth to light; detect he Ill;
My Natiu greatness scorneth bounded ways;
Untimely Power a few days ruin will;
Yea, Worth it self falls, till I list to raise.
The Earth is mine: of earthly things the care
I leave to Men, that like them, earthly are.
Ripe I yet am not to destroy Succession;
The Vice of other Kingdoms give him Time.
The Fates, without me, can make no progression;
By me alone, even Truth does fall, or clime:
The Instant petty webs, without me spunne,
Untimely ended be, as they begun.
Not Kings, but I, can Nemesis send forth,
The judgments of Revenge, and Wrong, are mine:
My Stampes alone do warrant real Worth;
How do untimely Virtues else decline?
For Son, or Father, to destroy each other,
Are bastard deeds, where Time is not the mother.
Such is the work this State has undertaken,
And keeps in Clouds; with purpose to advance
False counsels; in their selfe-craft justly shaken,
As grounded on my slave, and shadow Chance.
Nay more; My child Occasion is not free
To bring forth good, or evil, without me.
And shall I for revealing this misdeed,
By tying Future to the Present ill,
Which keeps disorders ways from happy speed;
Be guilty made of Man's still-erring will?
Shall I, that in my self still golden am,
By their Gross metal, bear an Iron name?
No; Let Man draw, by his own cursed Square,
Such crooked lines, as his frail thoughts affect:
And, like things that of nothing framed are,
Decline unto that Center of defect:
I will disclaim his downfall, and stand free,
As native rival to Eternity.
What means this Newborn child of Planets motion?
This finite Elfe of Man's vain acts, and errors?
Whose changing wheels in all thoughts stir commotion?
And in her own face, only, bears the Mirror.
A Mirror in which, since Time took her fall,
Mankind sees Ill increase; no Good at all.
Because in your vast mouth you hold your Tail,
As coupling Hges past with times to come;
Do you presume your Trophies shall not fail,
As both Creations Cradle, and her Tomb?
Or for beyond your self you cannot see,
By days, and hours; would you Eternal be?
Time is the weakest work of my Creation,
And, if not still repayr'd, must straight decay:
The Mortal take not my true constellation,
And so are daz'led, by her nimble sway,
To think her course long; which if measured right,
Is but a Minute of my Infinite.
A Minute which does her subsistence tie;
Subsistencies which, in not being, be:
Shall is to come; and was is passed by;
Time present cements this Duplicitie:
And if one must, of force, be like the other,
Of Nothing is not Nothing made the mother?
Why strives Time then to parallel with me?
What be her types of longest lasting glory?
Arts, Miters, Laws, Moments, Supremacy,
Of Natures erring Alchymie the story:
From Nothing sprang this point, and must, by course,
To that confusion turn again, or worse.
For she, and all her mortal offsprings, build
Upon the moving Base of selfe-conceipt;
Which constant form can neither take, nor yield;
But still change shapes, to multiply deceit:
Like playing Atomi, in vain contending,
Though they beginning had, to have no ending.
I, that at once see Times distinct progression;
I, in whose bosom was, and Shall, still be;
I, that in Causes work The Effects Succession,
Giving both Good, and Ill, their destiny;
Though I bind all, yet can receive no bound;
But see the finite still it self confound.
Time! therefore know thy limits, and strive not
To make thy self, or thy works Infinite,
Whose Essence only is to write, and blot:
Thy Changes prove thou have no stablish't right.
Govern thy mortal Sphere, deal not with mine:
Time but the servant is of Power Divine.
Blame thou this present State, that will blame thee;
Brick-wall your errors from one, to another;
Both fail alike unto Eternity,
Goodness of no mixed course can be the mother.
Both you, and yours do covet states Eternal;
Whence, though pride end, your pains yet be Infernal.
Ruin this Mass; work Change in all Estates,
Which, when they serve not me, are in your power:
Give unto their corruption doomes of Fate;
Let your vast womb your Cadmus-men devour.
The Vice yields scope enough for you, and hell,
To compass ill ends by not doing well.
Let Mustapha by your course be destroyed,
Let your wheels, made to wind up, and untwine,
Leave nothing constantly to be enjoyed:
For your Scithe mortal must to harm incline,
Which, as this World, your maker, does grow old,
Doomes her, for your toys, to be bought, and sold.
Cross your own steps; hasten to make, and mar;
With your Vicissitudes please, displease your own:
Your three light wheels of sundry fashions are,
And each, by others motion, overthrown.
Do what you can: Mine shall subsist by Me:
I am the measure of Felicity.
Solomon. Achmat.

Achmat! Go, charge the Bassha's to assemble:
God only is above me, and consulted.
Take freedom; not, as often Kings servants do,
To bind Church, State, and all Power under you.
Visions are these, or bodies which appeared?
Raised from within, or from above descending?
Did vows lift up my soul, or bring down these?
God's not pleased with us, till our hearts find ease.
What horror's this? Safety, Right, and a Crown,
Thrones must neglect that will adore Gods light.
His will, our good: Suppose it pluck us down;
Revenge is his. Against the ill what right?
What means that Glass borne on those glorious wings,
Whose piercing shadows on my self reflect
Stains, which my vows against my children bring?
My wrongs, and doubts, seem there despayres of Vice;
My Power a Turret; built against my Maker;
My danger, but disorders prejudice.
This Glass, true Mirror of the Infinite,
Shows all; yet can I nothing comprehend.
This Empire, nay the World, seems shadows there;
Which mysteries dissolve me into fear.
I that without feel no Superior power,
And feel within but what I will conceive,
Distract; know neither what to take, nor leave.
I, that was free before, am now captived;
This Sacrifice has raised me from my Earth,
By that I should, from that I am deprived.
In my affections Man, in knowledge more,
Protected no where, far more disunited;
Still King of Men, but of my Self no more.
In my Sons death, it shows this Empires fall;
And in his life, my danger still included:
To die, or kill, alike unnatural.
My powers, and spirits, with prayer thus confused,
Nor judge, nor rest, nor yield, nor reign I can:
No God, no Devil, no constant King, nor Man.
The Earth draws one way, and the sky another.
If God work thus, Kings must look upwards still,
And from these Powers they know not, choose a will.
Or else believe themselves, their strength, occasion;
Make wisdom conscience; and the world their sky:
So have all Tyrants done; and so must I.

Beglerbie. Solomon.

Solomon! If Rossa you will see alive,
You must make haste: for her Despair is such,
As she thinks all things but her Rage, too much.

Fortune! have thou not moulds enough of Sorrow,
But thou must those of Love, and Kindness borrow?
Tell me: Out of what ground grows Rossa's passion?

When hither I from Mustapha returned,
And had made you account of my Commission;
Rossa, whose heart in care for your health burned,
Curiously after Mustapha inquiring,
A token spies, which I from hence did bear,
For Mustapha by sweet Camena wrought;
Yet gave it not; for I began to fear,
And something in it more than kindness thought.
No sooner she espied this precious gift,
But, as enraged, hands on her self she lays;
From me, as one that from her self would shift,
She runs; nor till she found Camena stays.
I follow, and find both their voices high,
The one as doing, the other suffering pain:
But whether your Camena live, or die,
Or dead, if she by rage, or guilt be slain;
If she made Rossa mad, or Rossa mad
To hurt things dearest to her self be glad,
I know not. But o Solomon! make haste;
For Man's despair is but occasion past.

Rossa. Solomon. Beglerbie.

What! Am I not mine own? Who dare usurp
To take this Kingdom of my self from me?
Nature has lied. She says, Life unto many
May be denied, but not death unto any.
O Solomon! I have at once transgressed
The laws of Nature, and thy laws of State:
I wretched am, and you unfortunate.

Declare what Storm is this? What Accident?
Thy selfe-accusing does excuse intent.

Sir, odious is the fact on every side:
The remedy is more than you can bear;
And more must fall upon you than you fear.

What threatning's this? what horror? what despite?
Kings thoughts to Jealousy are ouer-tender.

And any weakness many does engender.

Rossa! what means this venom of thy breath?

Revenge, and Justice both require my death.

Then tell.

And lose the privilege of death.

Then tell, and die.

Nay tell, and live a worthy death.
Rippenot my wounds, dear Lord! silence is fit:
My life has shame, and death must cover it.

What should be secret unto thoughts that love?

All imperfections that offense do move.

What guiltiness cannot Goodwill forgive?

These horrors which in stained souls do live.

Are thy faults to thy self, or unto me?

To both alike. Remediless they be.

Yet show me trust: it proves your heart is pure,
To me, and all crimes else Kings can endure.

Imagine all the depths of wickedness:
My womb as hell; my soul the world of sin;
Confusion in my thoughts, fear merciless;
Without me Shame; Impenitence within.

These words are not of charge, but intercession,
As arguing not your Guilt, but your Oppression.
Yet least I fail, and error multiply,
Declare what is done? What moves this agony?

Thy Child is slain. These hands imbrued are,
Even in her bowels, whom I nursed with care.

So strange a death includes some odious crime.

She did conspire. Silence deuoures the rest.

Horror I apprehend, Danger, Despair:
All these lie hidden in this word, Conspire.

This Wretch conspired the ruin of this State.
Sir! ask no more: for Ills go in a blood;
You hear already more than does you good.

But tell: what made Camena think this thought?
Or by whom could she think to have it wrought?

Mischief it self is cause of mischief done.
What should she fear; since with her is combined
Mustapha, this States Successor, and your Son?

Can this be true? Is humane Nature such,
As in the worst part none can think too much?

The ruins of my own may show my faith:
For I can see no comforts after you;
Yet to your Bassha's know I not what is true.

Discover how these Treasons came to light.

Call Achmat first: for Truth is but a blast,
Till it his censures Oracle has past.

What scorns be these? how am I thus possessed?
Has Achmat other Greatness than by me?

If greater by you than your self he be.

In Kings the secrets of Creation rest.

Sir! you created him: he all the rest.

I gave that to his Worth, Faith, Industry.

And so these gifts tied to your children be.

What can his Age expect by innovation?

Ambition gets by doing, Estimation.

His power has no true Basis, but my Grace.

Sir? Strength, like Number, multiplies by place.

Decrepit slave, vile creature of mine;
Lies it in his base thoughts, and shaking hands,
To move the props whereon my Empire stands?

The name of Power is yours; the being his;
By whom Creation, Hope; Reward, and Fear
Spread, and disposed still are, every where.
Besides, there is no Age in man's desire,
Which still is active, young, and cannot rest:
For Achmat knows you will not what you can;
Since Crowns do change a State, but not the Man.

His Life, and Fortune stand upon my breath.

Contempt deposes Kings, as well as death.

But tell: How does their Treachery appear?
Has she confessed? Or who does them accuse?

This Guidon, with her own hand wrought, and sent,
Bears perfect record what was their intent.

Expound: What is the meaning of this work,
Under whose Art the arts of Mischief lurk?

These Clouds, they be the house of Jealousy,
Which fire, and water both, within them bear,
Where Good shows less, Ills greater than they be.
Saturn here feeds on Children that be his.
His word;
A fatal winding sheet Succession is.
This precious Hill, where daintynesse seems wast,
By Natures art, that all Art will exceed,
In careless finesse shows the sweet estate
Of Strength, and Providence together placed:
Two Intercessors reconciling hate,
And giving fear even of it self a taste.
Those Waves, which beat upon the cliffes, do show
The cruel storms, which Envy has below.
The Border round about in Characts has
The mind of all; which in effect is this:
It Is hard to know; as hard, and harder too,
When men do know, to bring their hearts to do.

What said she, when you showed her this work?

Like them that are descried, and feign would lurk.
For while she would have made her self seem clear,
She made her fault still more and more appear.

How brook'd she that the wicked only fear?
Her death (I mean) with what heart did she bear?

She neither stubburne was, nor overthrown;
And, but for Mustapha, made no request:
As if his harms had only been her own.
Solomon! Take heed.
" Malice, like Clockes woond up to watch the Sun,
" Hasting a headlong course on many wheels,
" Have never done, until they be undone.
I slew my Child; my Child would have slain thee:
All bloody Fates in my blood written be.

I swear by Mahomet, my Son shall die.
Revenge is Justice, and no cruelty.
Beglerbie! attend. This glorious Phaeton here,
That would at once subvert this State, and Me,
Safe to the Eunuchs carried let him be.
These spirits of practice, that contend with fate,
Must, by their deaths, do honor to a State.

Beglerbie. Priest. Mustapha.

Ah humorous Kings? how are you tossed, like waves,
With breaths, that from the earth beneath you move;
" Observed, and betrayed; known and undone;
" By being nothing, unto all things won.
" Frail man! that mould'st misfortune in thy Wit,
" By giving thy made I doll leave to fashion
" Thy ends to his. For mark; what comes of it?
" Nature is lost, our being only Chance,
" Where Grace alone, not Merit, must advance.
The one my Image: Solymans the other:
He, with himself, is wrought to spoil his own:
I, with my self, am made the instrument,
That Courts should have no great hearts innocent.
But stay: why wander I thus from my ends?
New counsels must be had when Planets fall:
Change has her periods, and is natural.
The Saint we worship is Authority,
Which lives in Kings, and cannot with them die.
True faith makes Martyrs unto God alone:
Misfortune has no such odds in a Throne.
But see! This Football to the Stars is come,
Mustapha I mean, in Innocence secure,
Which, for it will not give Fate, must endure.
Heli distract, fixed, and aghast, I see,
And will go nearer to observe the rest,
That Wit may take occasion at the best.
For if they feel their State, and know their Strength,
How prone this Mass is for another head;
Did ever hazard find Occasion dead?
Whether he get the Crown, or lose his blood,
The one is ill to him; to me both good.

False Mahomet! Thy Laws Monarchall are,
Unjust, ambitious; full of spoil, and blood,
Having, not of the best, but greatest, Care.
Must life yield up it self to be put out,
Before this frame of Nature be decayed?
Must blood the tribute be of Tyrants doubt?
O wretched Flesh! in which must be obeyed
Gods law, that wills Impossibility;
And Princes wills, the gulfes of Tyranny.
We Priests, even with the mystery of words,
First bind our selves, and with our selves the rest
To servitude, the sheath of Tyrants sword;
Each worst unto himself, approving best.
People! Believe in God: we are untrue,
And spiritual forges under Tyrants might:
God only does command what is good for you:
Where we do preach your bodies to the War;
Your goods to Tax; your Freedom unto bands;
Duties, by which you owned of others are;
And Fear, which to your harms does lend your hands.
Ah forlorn Wretch! with my hypocrisy,
I Mustapha have ruined, and this State.
I am the Evils friend, Hells Mediator,
A Fury unto man, a man to Furies.

Whence grows this sudden Rage thy gesture vtters?
These Agonies, and furious Blasphemings?
Man then does show his Reason is defaced,
When Rage thus shows it self with Reason graced.

If thou have felt the selfe-accusing War,
Where knowledge is the endless hell of thought,
The ruins of my Soul there figured are,
For where despair the Conscience does fear
My wounds bleed out that Horror which they bear.

Horror, and Pride, in Nature opposite;
The one makes Error great, the other small:
Where rooted habits have no sense at all.
Heli! judge not thy self with troubled mind,
But show thy heart: when Passions steames breathforth,
Even woes we wondered at are nothing worth.

I have offended Nature, God, and Thee:
To each a sin, to all impiety.

The faults of man are finite, like his merits:
His Mercies infinite that judges spirits.
Tell me thy Errors, teach me to forgive,
Which he that cannot do, knows not to live.

Can thou forgive? Rather avoid the cause
Which else makes Mercy more severe than Laws.

From man, to man duties are but respects,
The grounds where of are mere Humanity:
Can Justice other there than Mercy be?

Thought is an act. Who can forgive remorse,
Where Nature, by her own Law, suffers force?

What shall I do? Tell Me. I do not fear.

Preserve thy Father, with thy Self, and me:
Else guilty of each others death we be.

Tell how.

Thy Father purposes thy death:
I did advise: Thou offerest up thy breath.

What have I to my Father done amiss?

That wicked Rossa thy step mother is.

Wherein have I of Rossa ill deserved.

In that the Empire is for thee reserved.

Is it a fault to be my Fathers son?
" Ah foul Ambition! which, like Water-flouds
" Not channell-bound, do neighbors overrun;
" And growest nothing when thy rage is done.
Must Rossa's heirs out of my ashes rise?
Yet Zanger! I acquit thee of my blood;
For, I believe, thy heart has no impression
To ruin Mustapha for his Succession.
But tell what Colors they against me use;
And how my Fathers love they first did wound.

Of treason toward him they thee accuse:
Thy Fame, and Greatness, gives their malice ground.

Good World, where it is danger to be good.
Yet grudge I not power of my self to Power:
This baseness only in Mankind I blame,
That Indignation shoul give laws to fame.
Show me the Truth. To what rules am I bound?

No man commanded is by God to die,
As long as he may Persecution fly.

To fly has scorn; it argues Guiltiness,
Inherits Fear, weakly abandons Friends,
Gives Tyrants fame, takes Honor from distress.
Death! do thy worst. Thy greatest pains have end.

Mischief is like the Cockatrices eyes;
Sees first, and kills; or is seen first; and dies.
Fly to thy strength, which makes misfortune vain^.
Rossa intends thy ruin: What is she?
Seek in her bowels for thy Father lost:
Who can redeem a King with viler cost?

O false, and wicked colors of Desire!
Eternal bondage, unto him that seeks
To be possessed of all things that he likes!
Shall I a Son, and Subject seem to dare,
For any Selfenesse, to set Realms on fire,
Which golden titles to rebellions are?
Heli! even you have told me, Wealth was given
The wicked, to corrupt themselves, and others:
Greatness, and health, to make flesh proud, and cruel.
Where, in the good, Sickness mowes down desire;
Death glorifies; Misfortune humbles.
Since therefore Life is but the throne of Woe,
Which sickness, pain, desire, and fear inherit,
Ever most worth to men of weakest spirit:
Shall we, to languish in this brittle Iayle,
Seek, by ill deeds, to shun ill destiny?
And so, for toys, lose immortality?

Fatal Necessity is never known
Vntillit strike: and till that blow become,
Who falls, is by false visions overthrown.

Blasphemous love! safe conduct of the ill!
What power has given man's wickedness such skill?

Ah servile Men! how are your thoughts bewitched
With hopes, and fears, the price of your subjection,
That neither sense, nor time can make you see,
The art of Power will leave you nothing free?

Is it in us to rule a Sultans will?

We made them first for good, and not for ill.

Our Gods they are, their God remains above.
To think against anointed Power is death.

To worship Tyrants is no work of faith.

It Is rage of Folly that contends with Fate.

Yet hazard something to preserve the State.

Sedition wounds what should preserved be.

To wound Powers humors, keeps their honors free.

Admit this true. What sacrifice preuailes?

Force the petition is that never fayles.

Where then is Natures place for innocence?

Prosperity; that never makes offense.

Has Destiny no wheels but mere Occasion?

Could East upon the West else make invasion?

Confusion follows where Obedience leaves.

The Tyrant only that event deceaues.

And are the ways of Truth, and Honor such?

Weakness does ever think it owes too much.

Has Fame her glorious colors out of fear?

What is the world to him that is not there?

Tempt me no more. Goodwill is then a pain,
When her words beat the heart, and cannot enter.
I constant in my counsel do remain,
And more lives, for my own life will not venture.
My fellows! rest. Our Alcoran does bind,
That I alone should first my Father find.

Sir! by our Lords commandment, here I wayt,
To guide you to his presence:
Where, like a King, and Father, he intends
To honor, and acquaint you with his ends.

Heli! Farewell. All Fates are from above
Chained unto humors that must rise, or fall.
Think what we will: Men do but what they shall.

Are Men no more? Are Kings anointed blood
Profane to them, and sacred unto us?
Plays Power with laws of God, and Nature thus?
Shall sorrow write this story of oppression
Only in idle tears, and not in blood?
Where is Man's zeal to God, his love to men?
Shall that false Labyrinth of humane fear
Keep Honor, and Revenge still captive there?
No: let the spirit of Wrong stir up affection,
By smart to make both men, and Tyrants know,
There is in each, of each, the overthrow.
Are hell, and heaven peopled out of us?
Keep we the Keys of Conscience, and of Passion,
And can no just revenge in either fashion?
Was ever change unwelcome unto man?
Restless Mortality still hates the present:
No one Rule please the Universal can.
This Empires constitution Martial is,
Where hopes, and fears, must never be unbent:
Anarchie is called for here by discontent.
To Mustapha I know the worlds affection;
To Solomon fear only draws regard,
And men stir easily where the reyne is hard.
Then let them stir, and tear away this veyle
Of pride from Power; that our great Lord may see
Vnmiracled, his own Humanity.
People! Look up above this Diuans name;
This rent of Error; snare of Liberty;
Where punishment is Tyrants tax, and fame.
Abolish these false Oracles of might,
Courts subalterne, which bearing Tyrants seal,
Oppress the People, and make vain, Appeal.
Ruin these spetious maskes of Tyranny,
These Crowne-payd Caddies of their makers fashion;
Which, Power-like, for Right distribute Passion.
Confound Degrees, the Artifice of Thrones
To bear down Nature; while they raise up Art
With gilded Titles, to deceive the heart.
The Church absolues you: Truth approues your work.
Craft, and oppression every where God hates.
Besides, where Order is not, Change is free,
And gives all rights to Popularitie.

ANgels fell first from God, Man was the next that fell:
Both being made by him for Heaven, have for themselves made Hell.
Defection had, for ground, an essence which might fall,
Grown proud with glories of that God, like whom they would be all.
Hence each thing, but himself, these fallen Powers comprehend,
Nor can beyond depriuings ill their knowledge extend.
But in that darckned Orb, through mists which vice creates,
Ioylesse, enjoy a woeful glimpse of their once happy States.
And Serpent-like, with cursed eternity of evil,
Active in mischief many ways to add more to the Devil,
They take on every shape of vice that may delight,
Striving to make Creation less, Privation infinite.
Whence Man from goodness strayed, and wisdoms innocence,
Yea subject made to grave, and hell, by errors impotence,
Labors, with shaddowed light of imbecillitie,
To raise more towers of Babel up, above the Truth to be.
Among which Phantasms mounts that roof of Tyrants power,
The outward Church, whose nature is her Founders to devour.
And, through an hollow charm of life-forsaken words,
Entangle real things, to reign on all the earth affords:
By irreligious rites, helping Religions name
To blemifh truth, with gilded lies cast in Opinions frame.
Whence she that erst raised Kings, by pulling freedom down,
Now seeks to free inferior Powers, and only bind the Crown.
In which aspiring pride, where Wit encountreth Wit,
The power of the Thrones unequal is, and turns the scale with it:
Mastering those greedy swarms of superstitious rites,
Which by the sinners fear, not faith, makes her scope infinite.
Hence grows it that our Priests, erst Oracles of State,
Against whose doom our Sultans durst trust nothing unto fate,
At once were censured all, in one house to the fire,
As guilty in their idle souls of Icarus desire.
So free, and easy is it to cast down again
The creatures pride, which his Creator couets to restrain:
Again, so easy is it to bring States to death,
By urging those Powers to oppose, whose union gave them breath.
Thus from the lives of Priests kings first their doctrine stain,
And then let Sect, Schism, Question in, to qualify their reign.
Nor can this swollen Excess be well reformed in either,
While both stand mixed of good, and ill, which join not well together.
Kings seeking from the Church the rights of deity;
The Church from Kings, not nursing help, but Gods supremacy.
A strife wherein they both find loss, in stead of gain;
Since neither State can stand alone, much less divided reign.
The strife, and peace of which; like Ocean ebbs, and floods;
Successively, do here contract, and there disperse our goods.
And by this mutual spleen amongst these Sovereign parts
While each seeks gain by others loss, the Universal smarts.
For as souls, made to reign, when they let down their State
Into the bodies humors, straight those humors give them fate:
So, when the Church, and Crown (the souls of Empire) fall
Into Contempt, which humane Power cannot subsist withal,
They strive, turn, and descend, feel Errors destiny,
Which in a well-form'd Empire is, a Vagabond to be.
Thus, in Disorders chain, while each link wresteth other,
Incestuous Error, to her own, is made both child, and mother.
So as their doing is vndoings still to breed,
And fatally entombe again each other, in each deed.
Hence Humane Laws appealed, as Moderators come,
Who, under show of compremise, take on them Sovereign doom;
Entering in at the first, like Wisdom, with applause,
And though propounded from our faults, yet by, consent, made Laws;
Or rather scales, to weigh Opinion with the Truth,
Which, like Stepmothers, often bring the better side to ruth.
And as of active ill (from whence they took their root)
Guilty, and so not strong to stand upon a constant foot,
They wave, strive, and aspire, can bear no weight above,
But, as with Sovereign Power it self, and nothing else in love,
That rival spleen, which Equals still to Equals bear,
Forgotten, or a-sleepe, as if desire had conquered fear,
They factiously a peace with their chief rival make,
And let in Wars, which, like a Flood, all Sea-banks ouer-rake.
In which one act Laws prove, though nature gave them ground,
That they both mould, and practice took from War, which has no bound.
Because, like Mars his seed, they feed upon their own;
And by the spoil of Crowns, and Men, take glory to be known.
In which dear enterchange between Church, Laws, and Might,
While all their counsels are allayed, by oueracting, Right;
They leave their supreme pitch to servile Craft impawn'd,
Descending each to traffike there, where he ought to command.
Till fondly thus engaged into a Civil War,
They casting off all public ends, do only make to mar.
Yet keep a scope in show to counterpoise each other,
And save the health, and honor up of Monarchy their mother.
" But as in Man, whose frame is chiefly four Complexions,
" Really joined, dispersed, mixed with opposite connexions,
" When any of these fourefold, or distract too far,
" Diseases reign, which but Disorders native children are;
" From which contention stirred 'twixt Nature, and her Foes,
" While humor weaken humor does, to health the Body grows:
" So in these diverse Powers, excess of Opposition,
" Often, by begetting strange diseases, proves the States Physician.
Mauors, that monster, borne of many-headed Passion,
While it seems to destroy al moulds, to each mould giving fashion.
" Yet as these Elements, thus opposite in kind,
" While, balanced by superior ties, they live, as if combinde
" To make their Discords base unto that harmony,
" In whose sweet union mildely linkt all Powers concur to be;
" When any breaks too much that poyse wherein they stood,
" To make his own subsistence firm, with show of common good;
" By oueracting, straight it breaks that well built frame,
" Wherein their being stood entire, although they lost their name:
" So in that Noble work of public Government,
" When Crowns, Church, Soldiers, or the Laws, do overmuch dissent,
" That frame, wherein they lived, as fatally dissolved;
" And each in gulfes of selfe-Conceipt, as fatally, inuolu'd.
Thus reeles our present State, and her foundation waves,
By making Trophies of times past, of present time the graves.
Laws strive to curb the Church, the Church wounds Laws again;
The Soldier would have Church, Throne, Laws kept low, that he might reign.
And as before, while they joined to make Empire large,
All unto greatness raised were, by doing well their charge:
So now, by pulling quils each from the others wings,
They jointly all are cried down, by letting fall their Kings.
A fate prepared to shake that Ottoman succession,
Which erst, removed from men's eyes, wrought reverend impression.
Where now, this Sultans line profaned when men shall see,
They soon will scorn Grace, Hope, and Fear; the Scepters mystery.
Nor will they more by Faith, or Zeal, in war be led
To sacrifice their lives to Power, for fame when they be dead.
Or, to shun Mortal pains, provoke the Infinite;
Wrong in Man's nature stirring sparks, that give both heat, and light,
To gather in again those strengths they gave away;
And so pluck down that Sampsons post, on which our Sultans stay.
Zanger solus.

NOurisht in Court, where no Thoughts peace is nourisht,
Used to behold the Tragedies of ruin,
Brought up with fears that follow Princes fortunes;
Yet am I like him that has lost his knowledge,
Or never heard one story of Misfortune.
My heart does fall away: fear falls upon me.
Tame Rumors, that have been mine old acquaintance
Are to me now (like Monsters) fear, or wonder.
My Love begins to plague me with Suspicions.
My Mothers promises of my advancement;
The name of Mustapha so often murmured,
With whose name ever I have been rejoiced,
Now makes my heart misgiue, my spirits languish.
Man then is Augur of his own misfortune,
When his joy yields him arguments of anguish.
Achmat. Zanger.

Tyrants! Why swell you thus against your Makers?
Is raised Equality so soon grown wild?
Dare you deprive your People of Succession,
Which Thrones, and Scepters, on their freedoms build?
Have fear, or love, in Greatness no impression?
Since people, who did raise you to the Crown,
Are ladders standing still to let you down.

Achmat! what strange Events beget these Passions?

" Nature is ruined; Humanity fallen a sunder;
" Our Alcoran profaned; Empire defaced;
" Ruin is broken loose; Truth dead; Hope banished.
My heart is full; my voice, and spirits tremble.

Yet tell the worst.
By Counsel, or Comparison things lessen.

No Counsel, or Comparison can lessen
The loss of Mustapha, so vily murth'red.

How? dead? what Chance, or Malice has prevented
Mankindes good fortune?

Fathers unkindly doubts.

Tell, how?

when Solomon, by cunning spite
Of Rossa's witchcrafts, from his heart had banished
Justice of Kings, and Louingnesse of Fathers,
To wage, and lodge such camps of heady passions,
As that sects cunning practices could gather;
Envy took hold of worth: doubt did misconster:
Renown was made a lie, and yet a terror:
Nothing could calm his Rage, or move Compassion:
Mustapha must die. To which end fetched he was,
Laden with hopes, and promises of Favor.
So vile a thing is Craft in every heart,
As it makes Power it self descend to Art.
While Mustapha, that neither hoped, nor feared,
Seeing the storms of Rage, and Danger coming,
Yet came; and came accompanied with power.
But neither Power, which warranted his safety;
Nor Safety, that makes Violence a Justice;
Could hold him from Obedience to this Throne:
A Gulf, which has devoured many a one.

Alas! Could neither Truth appease his fury?
Nor his unlooked Humility of coming?
Nor any secret witnessing remorses?
Can Nature, from her self, make such divorces?
Tell on; that all the World may rue, and wonder.

There is a place environed with Trees,
Upon whose shaddowed center there is pitched
A large, embrodered, sumptuous Pauillion;
The stately Throne of Tyranny, and Murder.
Where Mighty men are slain, before they know
That they to other than to Honor go.
Mustapha no sooner to the Port did come,
But thither he is sent for, and conducted
By six slave Eunuchs, either taught to color
Mischief with reverence, or forced, by Nature,
To reverence true Virtue in misfortune.
While Mustapha, whose heart was now resolved,
Not fearing Death, which he might have prevented;
Nor craving Life, which he might well have gotten,
If he would other duties have forgotten;
Yet glad to speak his last thoughts to his Father,
Desired the Eunuchs to entreat it for him.
They did; wept; they and kneeled to his Father.
But bloody Rage, that glories to be cruel;
And Jealousy, that fears she is not fearful;
Made Solomon refuse to hear, or pity.
He bids them haste their charge: and bloody-ey'd
Beholds his Son, whilst he obeying died.

How did that doing Heart endure to suffer? Tell on.
Quicken my Powers hardened, and dull to good,
Which, yet unmoved hear tell of brothers blood.

while these six Eunuchs to this charge appointed
(Whose hearts had never used their hands to Pity,
Whose hands, now only, trembled to do Murder)
With Reverence, and Fear, stood still, amazed;
Loath to cut off such Worth, afraid to save it:
Mustapha with thoughts resolved, and united,
Bids them fulfill their charge, and look no further.
Their hearts afraid to let their hands be doing,
The Cord, that hateful instrument of Murder,
They lifting up let fall, and falling lift it:
Each sought to help, and helping hindered other.
Till Mustapha, in haste to be an Angel,
With heavenly smiles, and quiet words, foreshowes
The joy and peace of those souls where he goes.
His last words were; O Father! Now forgive me;
Forgive them too, that wrought my overthrow:
Let my Grave never minister offenses.
For, since my Father coueteth my death,
Behold, with joy, I offer him my breath.
The Eunuchs rore: Solomon his Rage is glutted:
His thoughts divine of Vengeance for this Murder:
Rumor flies up, and down: the People murmur:
Sorrow gives Laws before men know the truth;
Fear prophecieth aloud, and threatens ruth.

Remiss, and languisht are men's coward Spirits,
Where God forbids Revenge, and Patience too:
Yet to the dead Nature or daineth rites,
Which idle Love, I feel, has power to do.
I will go hence, and show to them that live,
That God Almighty cannot all forgive.

Rosten. Achmat.

Help Achmat! help: Furies runs over all.
Pity my state, that with the Empire fall.

What sound is this of Ruin, and Confusion?
Terror afraid? Cruelty come for Pity?
Seditious Rosten, running from Sedition?
And Malice forced to enemies for succor?

Achmat! The mysteries of Empire are dissolved.
Fury has made the People know their forces.
Majesty (as but a Mist,) they breed, and spread.
Nothing, but things impossible will please.
Mustapha must live again, or Rosten perish.
Oh wretchedness! which I cannot deny;
I am ashamed to live, and loath to die.

Tell on the dangers which concern the State:
For thee! thou Rod ordained unto the fire,
Thy other doomes let Acheron enquire.

When Mustapha was by the Eunuchs strangled,
Forthwith his Camp grew doubtful of his absence:
The guard of Solomon himself did murmur.
People began to search their Princes Counsels:
Fury gave Laws: the Laws of Duty vanished:
Kind Fear of him they loved Selfe-feare had banished.
The headlong spirits were the heads that guided:
He that most disobeyed, was most obeyed.
Fury so suddenly became united,
As while her forces nourished Confusion,
Confusion seemed with Discipline delighted.
Toward Solomon they run: and as the Waters,
" That meet with banks of Snow, make Snow grow Water:
So, even those Guards, that stood to interrupt them,
Give easy passage, and pass on amongst them.
Solomon, who saw this storm of Mischief coming,
Thinks absence his best argument unto them:
Retires himself, and sends me to demand,
What they demanded, or what meant their coming?
I spoke: they cried: For Mustapha, and Achmat.
Some bid away; some kill; some save; some hearken.
Those that cried, Save, were those that sought to kill me.
Who cried, Hark, were those that first brake silence,
They held that bad me Go. Humility was guilty;
Words were reproach; Silence in me was scornful;
They answered ere they asked; assured, and doubted.
I fled; their Fury followed to destroy me;
Fury made haste; Haste multiplied their Fury;
Each would do all; none would give place to other.
The hind most struck; and while the foremost listed
Their arms to strike, each Weapon hindered other:
Their running let their strokes, strokes let their running.
Desire, mortal enemy to desire,
Made them, that sought my life, give life unto me.
Now Achmat! Though Blood-thirst deserve no Pity;
Malice no love; though just Revenge be Mercy;
Yet save me. For, although my death be lawful,
The Judges, and the manner are unlawful.
If I die; what has Solomon for warrant?
Mischief is still the Gouerness of Mischief.
If Solomon be slain; where will they stay,
That Thorough God, and Majesty make way?

Rosten! dare thou name Duty, Laws, or Mercy?
Owe not thy self to him thou would destroy;
Make good thy love of Murder; die with Joy.

If Solomon who has been thy best Fortune,
Safe thou will see, or safe his state preserve,
Make haste. The State did never ill deserve.

Occasion! when art thou more glorious,
Than even now; when thou requir'st of me,
To fall with States in common destiny?
States trespass not: Tyrants they be that swerve,
And bring upon all Empires age, or death.
By making Truth but only Princes breath.
This Monarchy first rose by Industry;
Honor held up by universal Fame,
Stirring men's minds to strange Audacitie:
Great ends procured our Armies greater name:
To enemies no Injury had blame:
Worth was not proud: Authority was wise;
And did not on her own then tyrannize.
Now owned by humor of this dotard King
(Who, swollen with practice of long Government,
Does stain the Public with ill managing)
Honor is laid a-sleepe: Fame is unbent:
His Will, his End; and Powers right every where:
Now, what can this, but dissolution, bear?
Whether our choice, or Nature gave us Kings,
The end of either was the good of all:
Where many strengths make this Omnipotence,
The good of many there is natural.
One draws from all: Can that be fortunate?
All leave this one: Can this be Injury?
And shall I help to stay the Peoples rage
From this Estate, thus ruined with Age?
No People, No. Question these Thrones of Tyrants;
Revive your old equalities of Nature;
Authority is more than that she makes.
Lend not your strengths to keep your own strengths under.
Proceed in Fury: Fury has Law, and Reason,
Where it does plague the wickedness of Treason.
For when whole Kingdoms surfeit, and must fall,
Justice diuides not there, but ruins all.
Besides of Duties 'twixt the earth, and sky,
He can observe no one that cannot die.
But stay! Shall Man the Damme, and Grave of Crowns,
With Mutiny, pull sacred Scepters down?
People of Wisdom void, with Passion filled,
While they keep names still press to ruin things:
Freedom dissolues them; Order they refuse:
Worth, Freedom, Power, and Right while they destroy;
Worth, Freedom, Power, and Right they would enjoy.
What soul then loving Nature, Duty, Order,
Would hold a life of such a statelesse State,
As, made of Humors, must give Honor fate?
No Achmat! Rather, with thy hazard, strive
To save this high raised Sovereignty,
Under whose wings there was Prosperity.
I yield. But how?
Force is impossible; for that is theirs:
Counsel shows, like their enemy, Delay:
Order turns all desires into fears:
Their Art is violence: and Chance their end:
What, but Occasion, there can be my friend?
Behold where Rossa comes, in her looks varying,
Like rage, that with it self, still fears miscarying.

Rossa. Achmat.

Who ever thinks by Virtue to aspire,
And Goodness dreams to be but Fortunes star;
Or who by Mischiefs wit seeks his desire,
And thinks, no Conscience, ways to Honor are:
He, Mustapha! here seeing thee, and me;
Sees no Man's good, or ill rules Destiny.
Then ah! woe worth them that with God contend,
And would exchange the course of Fate by Wit,
Which God makes work, to bring his works to end,
And with it self, even often, does ruin it.
Ah Tyrant Fate! to them that do amiss:
For nothing left me, but my Error, is.

What Glories this that with it self is sad?
Good luck makes all hearts, but the guilty, glad.

Zanger, for whom even Mustapha was slain,
And unto whom Camena's blood was shed;
Zanger, for whom all Worlds on me complain,
Has done that which nor Law, nor Truth could do:
(Horror, and doubt in my desires breed)
Murdered himself, and overthrown me too.

Tell why? And how he so unthankful died?

In every Creatures heart there lives Desire,
Which men do hallow as appearing good:
For Greatness they esteem it to aspire,
Although it weakness be, well understood.
This unbound, raging, infinite Thought-fire
I took; nay it took me, and placed my heart
On hopes to alter Empire, and Succession.
Chance was my faith, and Order my despair:
Sect, Innovation, Change of Princes right,
My studies were: I thought Hope had no end,
In her, that has an Emperor to friend.
Whence like the Storms (that then like storms do blow,
When all things, but themselves, they overthrow)
I ventured; first to make the Father fear,
Then hate, then kill, his most beloved Child.
My Daughter did discover him my way,
To Mustapha she opened mine intent:
For she had tried, but could not turn my heart.
Yet no hurt to me she in telling meant,
Though hurt she did me to disclose my Art.
I sought Revenge: Revenge it could not be;
For, I confess, she never wronged me.
Remorse, that has a Faction in each heart,
Womanish Shame, which is Compassions friend,
Conspired with Truth to have restrained me;
Yet killed I her whom I did dearly love;
Furies of choice, what arguments can move?
I killed her: for I thought her death would prove
That Truth, not Hate, made Mustapha suspected:
The more it seemed, against a Mothers love,
The more it showed, I Solomon affected:
Thus, underneath severe, and upright dealing,
A mischievous Stepmothers malice stealing,
It took effect: For few mean ill in vain.
Which wicked Art although the Father knew,
Yet his Affection turned my ill to good:
Vice, but of hers, being only understood.
Fear grew discreet, and would not speak in vain;
Courage turned all the strengths of heart to bear;
Justice it self durst murmur, not complain:
So little care the Fates for us below:
So little men fear God, they do not know.
But ah! Woe worth each false preposterous way,
Which promises good luck to evil deeds:
Since Mustapha, whose death I made my Glory,
Has left me no power now, but to be sorry.
For Zanger, when he saw his Brother dead,
Confusedly with diverse shapes distract,
He silent stood, with Horrors compassed:
His Duty mixed with woe; Kindness with rage;
Reverence, Revenge, both representing shame,
Equally against, and with a Mothers name.
But as these shadows vanished from his mind,
The Globes of his enraged eyes he threw
On me, like Nature justly made unkind:
And for this hateful fault my Love did make,
From Pity, Woe, and Anger, thus he spoke:
" Mother! Is this the way of Woman's heart?
" Have you no Law, or God; but Will, to friend?
" Can neither Power, nor Goodness escape your Art?
" Be these the Counsels by which you ascend?
" Is there no Hell? Or do the Devils love fire?
" If neither God, Heaven, Hell, or Devil be;
" It Is plague enough that I am borne of thee.
" Mother! O monstrous Name! shall it be said,
" That thou have done this fact for Zangers sake?
" Honor, and Life, shall they to one upbraid,
" That, from thy Mischief, they their Honor take?
" O wretched Men! which under shame are laid,
" For faults which we, and which our Parents make.
" Yet Rossa! to be thine, in this I glory;
" That, being thine, gives power to make thee sorry.
He wounds his heart; and falling down with death
On Mustapha, who there for his sake died;
These words he spoke:
" Ah base Ambition! mould of Cruelty,
" In thy vast narrow bosom ever breed
" These hideous Counsels, light-abhorring deeds.
" Yet you pure souls that Mahomet adore!
" Read in these wounds my horror of his death,
" And to the Christians carry thou it, Breath.
He dies. Woes me. When in my heart I look,
Horror I see: all there lost but despair:
My Love, and Joy become Afflictions book;
Eternity of Shame is printed there.
To think of God! Alas, that so I may:
Yet Power, and Goodness can but show me Fear:
Mercy I cannot crave, that cannot trust:
Nor die I will; for death concludes pains:
Nor languish in conceit; for then I must
Abhor my soul, in which all Mischiefs reign.
I will bear with me, in this Bodies dust,
What curse soever to the earth remains.
I will bear with me Envy, Rage, Desire,
To set all Hearts, all Times, all Worlds on fire.
You weak Souls! whose true Love has made you base,
And fixed your Quiets upon others will:
You humble Hearts! which unto Power give place,
For conscience bearing yokes of Tyrants skill:
You poor Religious! who in hope of grace,
Bear many sore temptations of the ill,
Rejoice: Unkindness, Cruelty, Disgrace,
Vengeance, and Wrong bear hence with me I will.
Rather take heed: where can more Danger be,
Than where these Powers may be disposed by me?

VAst Superstition! Glorious style of Weakness!
Sprung from the deep disquiet of Man's passion,
To desolation, and despair of Nature:
Thy Texts bring Princes Titles into question:
Thy Prophets set on work the sword of Tyrants:
They manacle sweet Truth with their distinctions:
Let Virtue blood: teach Cruelty for Gods sake;
Fashioning one God; yet him of many fashions,
Like many-headed Error, in their Passions.
Mankind! Trust not these Superstitious dreams,
Fears Idols, Pleasures Relikes, Sorrows Pleasures.
They make the wilful hearts their holy Temples:
The Rebels unto Government their Martyrs,
No: Thou child of false miracles begotten!
False Miracles, which are but ignorance of Cause,
Lift up the hopes of thy abiected Prophets:
Courage, and Worth abjure thy painted heavens.
Sickness, thy blessings are; Misery, thy trial;
Nothing, thy way unto eternal being;
Death, to salvation; and the Grave to Heaven.
So Blessed be they, so Angel'd, so Eternized
That tie their senses to thy senseless glories,
And die, to cloy the after-age with stories.
Man should make much of Life, as Natures table,
Wherein she writes the Cipher of her glory.
Forsake not Nature, nor misunderstand her:
Her mysteries are read without Faiths eyesight:
She speaks in our flesh; and from our Senses,
Delivers down her wisdoms to our Reason.
If any man would break her laws to kill,
Nature does, for defense, allow offenses.
She neither taught the Father to destroy:
Nor promised any man, by dying, joy.
" OH wearisome Condition of Humanity!
" Borne under one Law, to another bound:
" Vainly begot, and yet forbidden vanity,
" Created sick, commanded to be sound:
What means Nature by these diverse Laws?
Passion and Reason, selfe-diuision cause:
Is it the mark, or Majesty of Power
To make offenses that it may forgive?
Nature herself, does her own self defloure,
To hate those errors she her self does give.
For how should man think that, he may not do
If Nature did not fail, and punish too?
Tyrant to others, to her self unjust,
Only commands things difficult and hard.
Forbids us all things, which it knows is lust,
Makes easy pains, impossible reward.
If Nature did not take delight in blood,
She would have made more easy ways to good.
We that are bound by vows, and by Promotion,
With pomp of holy Sacrifice and rites,
To teach belief in good and still devotion,
To preach of Heavens wonders, and delights:
Yet when each of us, in his own heart looks,
He finds the God there, far unlike his Books.
This Tragedy called MVSTAPHA, may be printed: Dated the three and twentieth
Day of JUNE, in the year of our LORD GOD, one thousand, six hundred, thirty
and two
