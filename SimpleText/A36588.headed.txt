FUll twenty years and more, our laboring Stage
Has lost, on this incorrgible age:
Our Poets, the John Ketches of the Nation,
Have seemed to lash ye, even to excoriation:
But still no sign remains; which plainly notes,
You bore like Hero's, or you bribed like Oats.
What can we do, when mimicking a Fop,
Like beating, Nut-trees, makes a larger Crop?
Faith we'll even spare our pains: and to content you,
Will fairly leave you what your Maker meant you.
Satyr was once your Physic, Wit your Food;
One nourisht not, and the other drew no Blood.
We now prescribe, like Doctors in despair,
The Diet your weak appetites can bear.
Since hearty Beef and Mutton will not do,
Here Is Julep dance, Ptisan of Song and show:
Give you strong Sense, the Liquor is too heady;
You're come to farce, that is Asses milk, already.
Some hopeful Youths there are, of callow Wit,
Who one Day may be Men, if Heaven think fit;
Sound may serve such, ere they to Sense are grown;
Like leading strings, till they can walk alone:
But yet to keep our Friends in countenance, know,
The Wise Italians first invented show;
Thence, into France the Noble Pageant past;
It Is England's Credit to be cozn'd last.
Freedom and Zeal have choused you over and over;
'Pray' give us leave to bubble you once more;
You never were so cheaply fooled before.
We bring you change, to humor your Disease;
Change for the worse has ever used to please:
Then it is the mode of France, without whose Rules,
None must presume to set up here for Fools:
In France, the oldest Man is always young,
Sees Opera's daily, learns the Tunes so long,
Till Foot, Hand, Head, keep time with every Song.
Each sings his part, echoing from Pit and Box,
With his hoarse Voice, half Harmony, half Pox.
Le plus grand Roy du Monde, is always ringing;
They show themselves good Subjects by their singing.
On that condition, set up every Throat;
You Whiggs may sing, for you have changed your Note.
Cits and Citesses, raise a joyful strain,
It Is a good Omen to begin a Reign:
Voices may help your Charter to restoring;
And get by singing, what you lost by roaring.

THou glorious Fabric! stand for ever, stand:
Well Worthy Thou to entertain
The God of Traffic, and of Gain!
To draw the Concourse of the Land,
And Wealth of all the Main.
But where the shoales of Merchants meeting?
Welcome to their Friends repeating,
Busy Bargains deafer sound!
Tongues Confused of every Nation?
Nothing here but Desolation,
Mournful silence reigns around.

O Hermes! pity me!
I was, while Heaven did smile,
The Queen of all this Isle,
Europes Pride,
And Albions Bride;
But gone my Plighted Lord! ah, gone is He!
O Hermes! pity me!

And I the Noble Flood, whose tributary Tide
Does on her Silver Margent smoothly glide;
But Heaven grew jealous of our happy state:
And bid revolving Fate,
Our Doom decree:
No more the King of Floods am I,
No more the Queen of Albion, She!

O Hermes! pity me!

O Hermes! pity me!

Behold!

Behold!

My Turrets on the ground
That once my Temples crowned!

The Sedgy Honors of my Brow's dispersed!
My Urn reverst!

Rise, rise, Augusta, rise!
And wipe thy weeping Eyes:
Augusta! for I call thee so!
It Is lawful for the Gods to know
Thy Future Name,
And growing Fame.
Rise rise, Augusta, rise.

O never, never will I rise!
Never will I cease my mourning,
Never wipe my Weeping Eyes,
Till my plighted Lord's returning!
Never never will I rise!

What brought Thee, Wretch, to this despair?
The Cause of thy Misfortune show.

It seems the Gods take little Care
Of Humane things below,
When even our Sufferings here they do not know!

Not unknowing came I down,
Disloyal Town!
Speak! did not Thou
Forsake thy Faith, and break thy Nuptial Vow?

Ah it is too true! too true!
But what could I, unthinking City, do?
Faction swayed me,
Zeal allured me,
Both assured me,
Both betrayed me!

Suppose me sent
Thy Albion to restore,
Can thou repent?

My falsehood I deplore!

Thou see her mourn; and I
With all my Waters, will her Tears supply.

Then by some loyal Deed regain
Thy long lost Reputation,
To wash away the stain
That blots a Noble Nation!
And free thy famous Town again
From force of Usurpation!

We'll wash away the stain
That blots a noble Nation,
And free this famous Town again
From force of Usurpation.

Behold Democracy and Zeal appear,
She that allured my Heart away,
And He that after made a prey.

Resist, and do not fear!

Resist, and do not fear!

Nymph of the City! bring thy Treasures,
Bring me more
To waste in Pleasures.

Thou have exhausted all my Store,
And I can give no more.

Thou Horny Flood for Zeal provide
A new Supply; And swell thy Moony tide,
That on thy buxom Back the floating Gold may glide.

Not all the Gold the Southern Sun produces,
Or Treasures of the famed Levant,
Suffice for Pious uses,
To feed the sacred hunger of a Saint!

Woe to the Vanquished, woe!
Slave as thou art,
Thy Wealth impart,
And me thy Victor know!

And me thy Victor know,
Resistless Arms are in my hand,
Thy Bars shall burst at my Command,
Thy Towry Head lie low.
Woe to the Vanquished, woe!

Were I not bound by fate
For ever, ever here,
My Walls I would translate
To some more happy Sphere,
Removed from servile fear.

Removed from servile fear,
Would I could disappear
And sink below the Mayn;
For Commonwealth's a Load
My old Imperial Flood
Shall never never never bear again.

A Commonwealth's a Load
Our old Imperial Flood
Shall never never bear again.

Pull down her Gates Expose her bare;
I must enjoy the proud, disdainful fair.
Haste, Archon, Haste
To lay her waste!

I Will hold her fast
To be embraced!

And she shall see
A Thousand Tyrants are in thee,
A Thousand thousand more in me!

Caledonion Shore
Hither am I come to save thee,
Not to force or to enslave thee,
But thy Albion to restore:
Hark! the peales the People ring,
Peace, and freedom and a King.

Hark! the Peales the People ring.
Peace and freedom and a King.

To Arms! to Arms!

I lead the way!

Cease your Alarmes!
And stay, brave Archon, stay!
It Is Doomed by Fates Decree!
It Is Doomed that Albion's dwelling,
All other Isles excelling,
By Peace shall Happy be!

What then remains for me?

Take my Caduceus! take this aweful Wand,
With this the Infernal Ghosts I can command,
And strike a Terror through the Stygian Land.
Commonwealth will want pretenses
Sleep will Creep on all his Senses;
Zeal that lent him her assistance,
Stand amazed without resistance.

I feel a lazy slumber lays me down!
Let Albion! let him take the Crown!
Happy let him reign,
Till I wake again!

In vain I rage, In vain,
I rouse my Powers;
But I shall wake again;
I shall to better Hours.
Even in slumber I will vex him;
Still perplex him,
Still incumber:
Know you that have adored him,
And Sovereign power afford him,
We Will reap the gains
Of all your pains
And seem to have restored him!

A stupyfying sadness
Leaves Her without motion;
But sleep will cure her madness,
And cool her to Devotion.

CEase, Augusta! Cease thy mourning,
Happy days appear,
Godlike Albion is returning
Loyal Hearts to Cheer!
Every Grace his youth Adorning,
Glorious as the Star of Morning,
Or the Planet of the Year.

Godlike Albion is returning, etc.


No delay, but obey:
To receive thy loved Lord! have away.

Medway and Isis, you that augment me,
Tides that increase my watery store,
And you that are Friends to Peace and Plenty,
Send my merry Boys all ashore;
Sea Men Skipping,
Mariners Leaping,
Shouting, Tripping,
Send my merry Boys all ashore!

THe Clouds divide, what Wonders,
What Wonders do I see!
The Wife of Jove, It Is she,
That Thunders, More than thundering He!

No, Hermes, No;
It Is Peace above
As it is below:
For Jove has left his wandering Love.

Great Queen of gathering Clouds;
Whose Moisture fills our Floods,
See; we fall before Thee,
Prostrate we adore Thee!

Great Queen of Nuptial Rites,
Whose power the Souls Unites,
And fills the Genial Bed with chaste Delights,
See; we fall before Thee
Prostrate we adore Thee!

It Is ratified above by every God,
And Jove has firm'd it with an Awful Nod;
That Albion shall his love renew:
But oh, ungrateful Fair,
Repeated Crimes beware,
And to his Bed be true!

SPeak Iris, from Batavia, speak the News!
Has she performed my dread Command,
Returning Albion to his longing Land,
Or dares the Nymph refuse?

Albion, by the Nymph attended,
Was to Neptune recommended,
Peace and plenty spread the Sails:
Venus in her shell before him,
From the Sands in safety bore him,
And supplied Etesian gales.
Archon on the Shore Commanding,
Lowly met him at his Landing,
Crowd's of People swarmed around;
Welcome rang like Peals of Thunder;
Welcome, rent the Skies assunder;
Welcome, Heaven and Earth resound.

Why stay we then on Earth
When Mortals laugh and love?
It Is time to mount above
And send Astraea down,
The Ruler of his Birth,
And Guardian of his Crown.
It Is time to mount above,
And send Astraea down.

It Is time to mount above,
And send Astraea down.

The Royal Squadron Marches,
Erect Tryumphal Arches,
For Albion and Albanius:
Rejoice at their returning,
The passages adorning:
The Royal Squadron marches,
Erect Triumphal Arches
For Albion and Albanius.

HAil, Royal Albion, Hail.

Hail Royal Albion, Hail to thee,
Thy longing Peoples expectation:

Sent from the Gods to set us free.
From Bondage and from Usurpation!

To pardon and to pity me,
And to forgive a guilty Nation!

Behold the differing Climes agree.
Rejoicing in the Restoration.

INfernal Offspring of the Night,
Debarred of Heaven your Native right,
And from the glorious Fields of Light,
Condemned in shades to dragg the Chain,
And fill with groans the gloomy Plain;
Since Pleasures here are none below,
Be ill our good, our joy be Woe;
Our Work to embroil the Worlds above,
Disturb their Union, disunite their Love,
And blast the Beauteous frame of our Victorious Foe.

Oh thou for whom those Worlds are made,
Thou Sire of all things and their end,
From hence they spring, and when they fade
In Shuffled Heaps they hither tend;
Here Humane Souls receive their Breath,
And wait for Bodies after Death.

Hear our Complaint and grant our Prayer.

Speak what you are,
And whence you fell?

I am thy first begotten care,
Conceived in Heaven; but born in Hell,
When Thou did bravely undertake in fight
You Arbitrary Power,
That rules by Sovereign might,
To set thy Heaven-born fellows free
And leave no difference in Degree,
In that Auspicious Hour
Was I begot by Thee.

One Mother bore us at a Birth,
Her Name was Zeal before she fell;
No fairer Nymph in Heaven or Earth
Till Saintship taught her to rebel:
But loosing Fame
And changing Name
She Is now the Good Old Cause in Hell.

Dear Pledges of a Flame not yet forgot,
Say, what on Earth has been your lot?

The Wealth of Albion's Isle was ours,
Augusta stoopt with all her stately Towr's!

Democracy kept Nobles under.

Zeal from the Pulpit roared like Thunder.

I trampled on the State.

I lorded over the Gown.

We both in Triumph sat
Usurpers of the Crown.
But oh Prodigious turn of Fate!
Heaven controuling,
Sent us rolling, rolling, down.

I wondered how of late our Acherontique shore
Grew thin, and Hell unpeople'd of her Store;
Charon for want of Use forgot his Oar.
The Souls of Bodies Dead flew all Sublime,
And hither none returned to purge a Crime:
But now I see since Albion is restored,
Death has no Business, nor the vengeful Sword.
It Is too too much that here I ly
From glorious Empire hurled;
By Jove excluded from the Sky,
By Albion from the World.

Were Commonwealth restored again,
Thou should have Millions of the slain
To fill thy dark abode.

For He a Race of Rebels sends,
And Zeal the Path of Heaven pretends;
But still mistakes the rode.

My laboring thought
At length has wrought
A bravely bold design,
In which you both shall join;
In borrowed shapes to Earth return;
Thou Commonwealth, a Patriot seem,
Thou Zeal, like true Religion burn,
To gain the giddy Crowds Esteem.
Alecto, thou to fair Augusta go,
And all thy Snakes into her Bosom throw.

Spare some to fling
Where they may sting
The Breast of Albion's King.

Let Jealousies so well be mixed,
That great Albanius be unfixt!

Forbear your vain Attempts, forbear;
Hell can have no admittance there:
The Peoples fear will serve as well,
Make him suspected, them Rebel.

Y' have all forgot
To forge a Plot
In seeming Care of Albion's Life;
Inspire the Crowd
With Clamours loud
TO involve his Brother and his Wife.

Take of a Thousand Souls at thy Command,
The basest, blackest of the Stygian band:
One that will Swear to all they can invent,
So thoroughly Damned that he can never repent:
One often sent to Earth,
And still at every Birth
He took a deeper stain:
One that in Adam's time was Cain:
One that was burnt in Sodom's flame,
For Crimes even here too black to name:
One, who through every form of ill has run:
One who in Naboth's days was Belial's Son:
One who has gained a Body fit for Sin;
Where all his Crimes
Of former Times
Lie Crowded in a Skin.

Take him;
Make him
What you please;
For He
Can be
A Rogue with ease.
One for mighty Mischief Born:
He can Swear and be Forsworn.
Take him, make him what you please;
For He can be a Rogue with ease.

Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh at our Woes,
The Wretch that is damned has nothing to lose.
Ye Furies advance
With the Ghosts in a Dance,
It Is a Jubilee here when the World is in trouble:
When People rebel
We frolic in Hell;
But when the King falls, the pleasure is double:

Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh at our VVoes;
The Wretch that is damned has nothing to lose.

O Jealousy, Thou raging ill,
Why have thou found a Room in Lovers Hearts,
Afflicting what thou can not kill,
And Poisoning Love himself, with his own Darts?
I find my Albion's Heart is gone,
My first offenses yet remain,
Nor can repentance Love regain;
One writ in Sand, alas, in Marble one.
I rave, I rave, my Spirits boil
Like flames increased and mounting high with pou'ring Oil:
Disdain and Love succeed by turns;
One freezes me, and the other burns; It burns.
Away soft Love, Thou Foe to rest,
Give Hate the full possession of my Breast.
Hate is the nobler passion far
When Love is ill repaid;
For at one blow it ends the War,
And Cures the Lovesick Maid.

LEt not thy generous passion wast its rage,
But once again restore our golden Age;
Still to weep and to complain,
Does but more provoke disdain,
Let public good,
Inflame thy Blood;
With Crowds of Warlike People thou art stored,
And heaps of Gold;
Reject thy old,
And to thy Bed receive another Lord.

Religion shall thy Bonds release,
For Heaven can loose, as well as tie all;
And when it is for the Nations peace
A King is but a King on Trial;
When Love is lost, let Marriage end,
And leave a Husband for a Friend.

With Jealousy swarming
The People are Arming
And frights of oppression invade 'em.

If they fall to relenting,
For fear of repenting,
Religion shall help to persuade 'em.

No more, no more Temptations use
To bend my Will;
How hard a task it is to refuse
A pleasing ill?

Maintain the seeming duty of a Wife,
A modest show will jealous Eyes deceive,
Affect a fear for hated Albion's Life,
And for imaginary Dangers grieve.

His Foes already stand protected,
His Friends by public Fame suspected,
Albanius must forsake his Isle:
A Plot Contrived in happy hour
Bereaves him of his Royal Power,
For Heaven to mourn and Hell to smile.
THen Zeal and Commonwealth infest
My Land again;
The fumes of madness that possessed
The Peoples giddy Brain,
Once more disturb the Nations rest,
And dye Rebellion in a deeper Stain.
Will they at length awake the sleeping Sword,
And force revenge from their offended Lord?
How long, ye Gods, how long
Can Royal patience bear
The Insults and wrong
Of Mad-mens jealousies, and causeless fear?
I thought their love by mildness might be gained,
By Peace I was restored, in Peace I Reigned:
But Tumults, Seditions,
And haughty Petitions,
Are all the effects of a merciful Nature;
Forgiving and granting,
E're Mortals are wanting,
But leads to Rebelling against their Creator.

With pity Jove beholds thy State,
But Jove is circumscribed by Fate;
The over whelming Tide rowls on so fast,
It gains upon this Islands wast:
And is opposed too late! too late!

What then must helpless Albion do?

Delude the fury of the Foe,
And to preserve Albanius, let him go;
For it is decreed,
Thy Land must bleed,
For Crimes not thine, by wrathful Jove;
A Sacred Flood
of Royal Blood,
Cries Vengeance, Vengeance loud above.

Shall I, to assuage
Their Brutal rage,
The Regal stem destroy;
Or must I lose,
(To please my Foes,)
My sole remaining joy?
Ye God's what worse,
What greater Curse,
Can all your Wrath employ?

Oh Albion! hear the Gods and me!
Well, am I lost in saving Thee.
Not exile or danger can fright a brave Spirit
With Innocence guarded,
With Virtue rewarded;
I make of my sufferings a Merit.

Since then the Gods, and Thou will have it so;
Go: (can I live once more to bid Thee?) go,
Where thy Misfortunes call Thee and thy Fate:
Go, guiltless Victim of a guilty State,
In War my Champion to defend,
In peaceful Hours, when Souls unbend,
My Brother, and what is more my Friend!
Born where the Foamy Billows roar,
On Seas less Dangerous than the Shore:
Go, where the Gods thy Refuge have assigned:
Go from my sight; but never from my Mind.

Whatever Hospitable ground
shall be for me, unhappy Exile, found,
Till Heaven vouchsafe to smile;
What Land so e're,
Though none so dear,
As this ungrateful Isle;
O think! O think! no distance can remove
My vowed Allegiance, and my Loyal Love.

The Rosy fingered Morn appears,
And from and her Mantle shakes her Tears,
In promise of a glorious Day:
The Sun, returning, Mortals chears,
And drives the Rising Mists away,
In promise of a glorious Day.

ALL Hail ye Royal pair!
The God's peculiar care:
Fear not the malice of your Foes;
Their Dark designing
And Combining,
Time and truth shall once expose:
Fear not the malice of your Foes.
My sacred Oracles assure,
The Tempest shall not long endure;
But when the Nations Crimes are purged away,
Then shall you both in glory shine;
Propitious both, and both Divine:
In Luster equal to the God of Day.

OLd Father Ocean calls my Tide:
Come away* come away,
The Barks upon the Billows ride,
The Master will not stay;
The merry Boson from his side,
His Whistle takes to check and chide
The lingering Lads delay,
And all the Crew alowd has Cried,
Come away, come away.
See the God of Seas attends Thee,
Nymphs Divine, a Beauteous Train:
All the calmer gales befriend Thee
In thy passage over the Main:
Every Maid her Locks is binding,
Every Triton's Horn is winding,
Welcome to the watery Plain.

YE Nymphs, the Charge is Royal,
Which you must convey;
Your Hearts and Hands employ all,
Hasten to obey;
When Earth is grown disloyal,
Show there is Honor in the Sea.

Sports and Pleasures shall attend you
Through all the Watery Plains,
Where Neptune Reigns:
Venus ready to defend you,
And her Nymphs to ease your Pains,
No storm shall offend you,
Passing the Main;
Nor Billow threat in vain,
So Sacred a Train,
Till the Gods that defend you,
Restore you again.

See at your blessed returning
Rage disappears;
The VVidow'd Isle in Mourning
Dries up her Tears,
With Flowers the Meads adorning,
Pleasure appears,
And love dispels the Nations causeless fears.

BEhold ye Powers! from Whom I own
A Birth immortal, and a Throne:
See a Sacred King uncrown'd,
See your Offspring, Albion, bound:
The gifts you gave with lavish hand,
Are all bestowed in vain:
Extended Empire on the Land,
Unbounded over the Main.

Empire over the Land and Main,
Heaven that gave can take again;
But a mind that is truly brave,
Stands despising,
Storms arising,
And can never be made a Slave.

Unhelpt I am, who pitied the distressed,
And none oppressing, am by all oppressed;
Betrayed, forsaken, and of hope bereft:

Yet still the Gods and Innocence are left.

Ah! what can thou avail,
Against Rebellion armed with zeal,
And faced with public good?
O Monarch's see
Your Fate in me!
To rule by Love,
To shed no Blood,
May be extolled above;
But here below,
Let Princes know
It Is fatal to be good.

To rule by Love etc.

But see! what prodigies are these?

Your Father Neptune from the Seas,
Has Nereids and blew Triton's sent,
To charm your discontent.

FRom the low Palace of old Father Ocean,
come we in pity your cares to deplore:
Sea-spouting Dolphins are tamed for our motion,
Moony Tides swelling to roll us ashore,
Every Nymph of the flood, her Tresses rending,
Throws of her Armlet of Pearl in the Main;
Neptune in anguish his Charge unattended,
Vessels are foundring, and Vows are in vain.

HA, ha, it is what so long I wished and vowed,
Our Plots and delusions,
Have wrought such confusions,
That the Monarch's a Slave to the Crowd.

A Design we somented,

By Hell it was new!

A false Plot invented,

To cover a true.

First with promised faith we flattered,

Then jealousies and fears we scattered.

We never valued right and wrong,
But as they served our cause;

Our Business was to please the throng,
And Court their wild applause:

For this we bribed the Lawyers Tongue,
And then destroyed the Law's.

For this, etc.

To make him safe, we made his Friends our Prey;

To make him great we scorned his Royal sway,

And to confirm his Crown, we took his Heir away.

TO increase his store,
We kept him poor:

And when to wants we had betrayed him,
To keep him low,
Pronounced a Foe,
Who e're presumed to aid him.

But you forget the noblest part,
And Masterpiece of all your Art,
You told him he was sick at Heart.

And when you could not work belief
In Albion of the imagined grief;
Your perjured vouchers in a Breath,
Made Oath that he was sick to Death;
And then five hundred Quacks of skill
Resolved it was fit he should be ill.

Now heigh for a Commonwealth,
We merrily Drink and Sing,
It Is to the Nations Health,
For every Man's a King.

Then let the Masque begin,
The Saints advance,
To fill the Dance,
And the Property Boys come in.

Let the Saints ascend the Throne.

Saints have Wives, and Wives have Preachers,
Guifted men, and able Teachers;
These to get, and those to own;

Let the Saints ascend the Throne.

Freedom is a bait alluring;
Them betraying, us securing,
While to Sovereign power we foar.

Old delusions new repeated,
Shows 'em born but to be cheated,
As their Fathers were before.

SEE Friendless Albion there alone,
Without Defense
But Innocence;
Albanius now is gone.

Say then, What must be done?

The Gods have put him in our hand.

He must be slain!

But who shall then Command?

The People: for the right returns to those,
Who did the trust impose.

It Is fit another Sun should rise,
To cheer the World, and light the Skies.

But when the Sun,
His race has run,
And neither cheers the World, nor lights the Skies;
It Is fit a Commonwealth of Stars should rise.

Each noble vice,
Shall bear a Price,
And Virtue shall a drug become:
An empty Name
Was all her Fame,
But now she shall be Dumb.

If open Vice be what you drive at,
A Name so broad we'll never connive at.
Saints love Vice, but more refin'dly,
Keep her close, and use her kindly.

Fall on.

Fall on: Ere Albion's death we'll try,
If one or many shall his room supply.

SEE the Gods my cause desending;
When all humane help was past!

Factions mutually contending,
By each other fall at last.

But is not yonder Proteus Cave,
Below that steep,
Which rising Billows brave?

It is: And in it lies the God asleep:
And snorting by,
We may descry,
The Monsters of the deep.

He knows the past,
And can resolve the future too.

It Is true!
But hold him fast,
For he can change his hew.

ALbion, loved of Gods and Men,
Prince of Peace too mildly Reigning,
Cease thy sorrow and complaining;
Thou shall be restored again:
Albion, loved of Gods and Men.
Still thou art the care of Heaven,
In thy Youth to Exile driven:
Heaven thy ruin then prevented,
Till the guilty Land repented:
In thy Age, when none could aid Thee,
Foes conspired, and Friends betrayed Thee;
To the brink of danger driven,
Still thou art the Care of Heaven.

To whom shall I my preservation owe?

Ask me no more! for it is by Neptune's Foe.

Our seeming Friends, who joined alone,
To pull down one, and build another Throne,
Are all dispersed and gone:
We brave republic Souls remain.

And it is by us that Albion must be Slain:
Say, whom shall we employ
The Tyrant to destroy?

That Archer is by Fate designed,
With one Eye clear, and the other blind.

He seems inspired to do it.

Shoot Holy Cyclop, shoot.

Lo! Heaven and Earth combine,
To blast our bold design.
What Miracles are shown?
Nature's alarmed,
And Fires are armed,
To guard the Sacred Throne.

What help, when jarring Elements conspire
To punish our audacious Crimes.
Retreat betimes,
To shun the avenging Fire.

To shun the avenging Fire.

Let our tuneful accents upwards move,
Till they reach the vaulted Arch of those above;
Let us adore 'em;
Let us fall before 'em:

Kings they made, and Kings they love*
When they protect a rightful Monarch's Reign,
The Gods in Heaven, the Gods on Earth maintain.

When they protect, etc.

But see what glories guild the main.

Bright Venus brings Albanius back again,
With all the loves and graces in her train.

ALbion, Hail; The Gods present Thee,
All the richest of their Treasures,
Peace and Pleasures.
To content Thee,
Dancing their eternal measures.

But above all humane blessing;
Take a Warlike Loyal Brother,
Never Prince had such another:
Conduct, Courage, truth expressing,
All Heroic worth possessing.

But above all, etc.

From Jove's Imperial Court,
Where all the Gods resort;
In awful Council met,
Surprising news I bear:
Albion the Great,
Must change his Seat,
For He Is adopted there.

What Stars above shall we displace?
Where shall he fill a Room Divine?

Descended from the Sea Gods Race,
Let him by my Orion shine.

No, Not by that tempestuous sign:
Betwixt the Balance and the Maid,
The Just,
August,
And peaceful shade,
Shall shine in Heaven with Beams displayed,
While great Albanius is on Earth obeyed:

Albanius Lord of Land and Main,
Shall with fraternal virtues Reign;
And add his own,
To fill the Throne;
Adored and feared, and loved no less:
In War Victorious, mild in Peace,
The joy of men, and Jove's increase.

O Thou! Who mount'st the Ethereal Throne,
Be kind and happy to thy own;
Now Albion is come,
The People of the Sky,
Run gazing and Cry,
Make Room, make Room,
Make room for our new Deity.

Behold what Triumphs are prepared to grace
Thy glorious Race,
Where Love and Honor claim an equal place;
Already are they fixed by Fate,
And only ripening Ages wait.

REnown, assume thy Trumpet!
From Pole to Pole resounding:
Great Albion's Name;
Great Albion's Name shall be
The Theme of Fame, shall be great Albion's Name,
Great Albion's Name, Great Albion's Name.
Record the Garters glory:
A Badge for Hero's, and for Kings to bear:
For Kings to bear!
And swell the Immortal Story,
With Songs of Gods, and fit for Gods to hear;
And swell the Immortal Story,
With Songs of Gods, and fit for Gods to hear;
For Gods to hear.
