WHo can enough the Stages Fate deplore?
From men of sense, (our Patrons heretofore,)
By whom, (because all was well understood,
In our worst Plays, something was still thought good,)
To you the tastless judging Tribe we fly,
Who treat our best with that severity,
You never know, where it is the Wit does ly;
Poets do justly your dull Censures scorn,
Men of your parts, for us alone were born,
Your Natural parts, which never would fail to Charm,
Did not your Damned acquired ones do you harm;
To please our Sex, you question all that is writ,
You Sham, Clinch, Quibble, Cant, and Counterfit,
And something fain you would show, might pass for wit,
While folly can alone our wishes hit.
Half Fools it is true, like half Wits, awkward prove,
But a good thorough Fool, all Women love.
Mark but the use of Fools, which is it you want?
A quiet Husband? or a free Gallant?
You have him, but a Wit is such a Tool!
Fit to make nothing, till he is made a Fool,
And that is about the Bush, which to prevent,
We'll kindly take you such as God has sent;
Then be advised. --
And this dull strife for wittiness give ore,
Ground your small merit on a juster score,
Less of ill Wit, and of good Breeding more,
From France you bring us Noise, instead of Sense.
Instead of Courage, saucy Confidence;
With antique Dresses, and Impertinence.
One eminent Grace does in that Land abound,
Manners, which you sweet Sparks have never found.
Manners, in these refined, though ill-bred Times,
Like Christian Charity amongst Divines,
Would make Atonement for a world of Crimes.
You Would be so welcome here, would you but sit
Like Ciphers, as you are, and grace the Pit,
Well dressed, well bred, we'd never look for Wit.
But you come bawling in with broken French,
Roaring out Oaths aloud, from Bench to Bench,
And bellowing Bawdy to the Orange-wench;
Quarrel with Masks, and to be brisk, and free,
You sell 'em Bargains for a Repartee,
And then cry Damn 'em Whores, who ere they be.
For shame from these Barbarities remove;
If you will be rude, in War your roughness prove,
Or at some hours 'twill be allowed in Love;
But you with all wrong qualities endu'd,
Are too too civil, when you should be rude.

WAtt, have you delivered the Letter, as I ordered you?


Yes, Sir, I have to your Uncles Friend Mr Save-all, but he says, he has made
your peace so often and to so little purpose, that he now absolutely despairs
of a Reconciliation between you


But then thou should have told him, I would not take that for an answer.


Then he would have answered me, Let your precious Master take his course, for
he is like to have no better answer


Could thou not tell him again, that I have taken all the Courses, a young
Gentleman can, to maintain himself like one; but they are all run out, and I
have not one trick to manage, and may perish unless that damned Uncle of mine,
set me again, nor know I how to arrive to that but through his intercession


Puh, Sir, then I know what he would have told me again, and mustered up all
your Vices: then that this same Uncle (so despised a thing) before he discarded
you, had releast you out of Prison, within the space of Thirteen months, a
Dozen times


Well, Coxcomb, that was not once a Month then. Why should he upbraid me with
it? I am sure 'twas I that suffered for it, and so you might have told him


Yes, and then he would have answered me, that your extravagant courses have
cost your Uncle at least Fifteen hundred Pounds, and upon your last debauch
(when he resolved never to concern himself for you again, about a year ago) he
cast another Five hundred Pound after you, with this Proviso that you should
never trouble him any more; and at last finding you incorrigible, he Married on
purpose to disinherit you


Ay, that damned Marriage has ruined me -- but, damn it, let it go, and let my
Uncle go to the Devil, and let Save-all go, and be damned for a Cynical Ass as
he is. -- I confess he has by his formal Solicitation, made up breaches between
my Uncle and me, at least a Score of times, what a Devil had it been for him to
have tried his Interest for me once more


I wish you would consider what is to be done, for your own sake, besides you
ought to take some care of me your Creature, that have stuck to you through all
Fortunes, to maintain and keep up your Gallantry, and think in time before
these Cloths are worn out, for you will find it somewhat difficult to Equip your
self again


I care not, I will not give my self one Minutes trouble about it, I ll rather
dye here in New Alsatia, or sell my self a Slave to the Galleys. Consider quoth
a? -- what should I consider


Consider your poor Whore Sir, for she (as you have managed her) is in a worse
Case than your self; her Cloths grow somewhat shabby


Ay there is it, I would willingly do somewhat for her, but how the Devil knows.
-- Have I not already done all that possibly can be done by a distressed
hopeless heir


Has the Die quite failed you, and all the Cheats that thereupon depend? Your
Marrabone bowling Booties forsaken you? your Tennis Court Betting? your
Cockpit Cozenages too? and all your Arts of borrowing


All, all Arts are quite confounded.


I wonder your Father should leave you nothing to live upon but Wit, and that
not for life


Hold thy peace; -- I am contriving a way how (tho it cost me my life,) to
disgrace my Uncle


There Is a Plot! I beseech you think of your poor Whore, Sir -- what do you
think will become of her, if you should cast away your self


Thou know I must leave her once.


If you could leave her handsomely -- and betake your self to other Women.


To other Women? what to do? to empty my Bones? I have had enough of variety.


Ay but, Sir, you are handsome and young; I have known such in this Town, who
have brought in as good a Living, as any Miss of 'em all; kept their Coaches
too, with only being a little Snout Fair


Damn it, I Will never fall so low to do the drugery of any Old Lady.


Very good! many a younger Brother would leap at such preferment.


No I Will pursue my first Resolves, and will commit some death-deserving Crime,
though these Cloths go to the Hangman for it, in spite to him that was my Uncle,
and that ridiculous, grave, formal Nonsensical speaking Friend of his Saveall,
that calls People Pe-o-p-le.


-- Could I expect this honor? how am I obliged to you for this Visit?

-- Sir, being informed my Uncle was come to Town and you with him, I did
presume to write to you


Send away your Servant.


Go, wait without.


One Servant is not sit to be employed in all Offices. -- It was a bold thing
indeed, to write to me, considering how often I have interceded for you, and
reconciled you to your overgrateful Uncle, therein was your good thoughts of
your self


The wretchedst Creature breathing! in having wearied out my best of Friends,
on whom my chiefest happiness depended


No, I am not wearied, but have the same good wishes still to serve you, but
cannot strive against impetuous Torrents


My Uncle's then resolved that I shall perish. But did you speak on my behalf
this time


O Sir! I have tried him even unto his displeasure.


But did you mention that good deed of mine; which he once swore should ever be
remembered


All, Sir, all; but 'twas in vain to urge your merits to him, though to say
truth, it was a worthy Action to save him, from the inhuman Violence of Thieves
and Murderers -- but --


Watt, and I, made Four of the stoutest Rogues fly for it, that ever cried Stand
upon the Kings high way. -- After they had dismounted him, and set their
Pistols to his Bosom; he crying and roaring out for Assistance, I happened by
mere Accident to pass by, which was a miraculous chance, nay it was, when I was
out of his Favor too, and had been so for six Months; and yet Nature prevailed
and I saved him -- nay more --


Fare you well, Sir, I could have said all this as well as you -- but --


Good Mr Saveall, do not leave me.


Good Mr Careless, give me leave to be heard as well as to hear.


I cry you mercy, Sir, pray proceed.


I was saying what you did then for your Uncle was a worthy Action, and you
expressed your self a perfectly kind Nephew; the Action too drew blessings on
your head, notwithstanding you were then cast off to Reprobation, he then
received you into his Bosom again, Adopted you his Son, tho but his Sisters
Son, allowed you Three hundred Pounds a year, and gave Walter Fifty Pounds for
the good Service he then did


And he deserved it, I Will say that, he received a flash over the Coxcomb, he
never bore his drink well since


God be with you the second time.


Nay sweet Mr. Saveall --


I came not altogether to hear you speak, but to speak unto you my self.


Sir, I will attend with all due submission.


As I was saying -- Sir Oliver being thus gracious unto you, you presumed upon
your Merit still, and flew to new extravagancies, till for one good service you
did him, he repaid you a hundred, by paying of Surgions Bills for Claps,
Wounds, etc. Redeeming you out of Prison, till wearyed with your Extravagancies
he turned you off for ever, nay even at that time --


Even at that time I could have lived, and might do so still, only by being
imagined his Heir, had he not been Married: a Curse upon that Marriage, it
turned the hearts of all well minded Citizens from me


A Third time I will take my leave.


Sir, You shall see the last of me first and that immediately, that you may let
my Uncle know, I Will be no more a Vexation to him, unless in Charity he will see
me buried; it is all I ask.


I hope you will not kill your self and thereby damn your Soul.


O Sir, you need not disarm me, I can die without that help -- I feel my heart
ready to break; alas Sir, my Uncle has abandoned me, and so have you, and then
it is high time to dye -- Watt --


Your pleasure, Sir.


I have delayed too long to tell him the good News I bring him.


Put me to Bed, Watt.


Mrs. Phebe is come indeed, but I hope you will not go to Bed with her before
him.


Put me to Bed, I say -- come undress me quickly.


Lord, Lord, Sir, how his heart pants! pangs of death I fear.


Alas! I hope not so, good Mr. Walter. I will now be brief -- Mr. Careless,
pray look up


No, no, Sir, I am well prepared to die, I thank my Stars.


Why Sir Oliver is Friends with you!


Alas, alas Sir, --


Why I thought you a Man of more resolution.


Ay, Ay Sir, I have made a resolution.


Come Sir, I profess, all that I have done was only to search your temper.


Ay, Ay, Sir, but I am a fraid you have searched too deep.


Ay, Ay, --


Come Sir, look up, Sir Oliver intends to take you into Grace again, and make a
farther Trial of you -- you may be yet his Heir, for your New young Aunt is now
out of hopes of a Child, having been Married at least 20 Months, and no signs
of Issue


Ah Sir, -- can this be possible?


Most possible. Come Sir, you must along with me to your Uncle; and all things
shall be well again


Your Generosity has revived me, Sir, -- Watt, my Sword. -- tell Phebe I am now
in haste, going to see my Uncle, and cannot stay to speak with her.


Good Gentleman, how feebly he stands! but his Uncles kind Aspect will recover
him


Sir, what if I should first (to show the Reformation of my mind) leave off my
unbecoming Perriwig, and put off these gay Cloths, and Equip my self in a
Students Gown? I can be furnished at the Brokers, Sir


The Reformation of your mind's sufficient; and these Cloths become your
Quality.


What? he is departed, it seems.


Called by his happy Fortune.


Refuse to see me? but I Will fetch him back.


Hold, hold, sweet Phebe, you will not ruin him; he is gone to be Friends with
his Uncle, and I dare promise you within a day or two, a New Gown and Petticoat


You know how to dissemble too -- pray let him make me amends for the wrongs he
has done me, for I neither can nor will any longer bear with him


Nor bear him neither? You had best have a care what you say.


Nor with him neither, Sawcebox, unless he Marry me, as he promised, and save
my honor


Your honor, with a Pox!


Yes, Sirrah, my honor, which was unspotted before he seduced me, which e're
long I Will make him know -- nay and thou shall assist me in it


Why look you, Mrs. Phebe, be not so passionate, and I Will do all I can to serve
you


It Is your safest way, or I Will be the death of you.


Bless me, how desperate Poverty makes a Whore? -- but what Course do you
intend to take with him


Why I intend to send my wealthy Kinsman that lives in the City to demand
satisfaction of him, which if he refuses, I don't doubt but he will hamper him


What I Will warrant you, you mean Saleware, he that has the slanting Wife?


Why how now Impudence! do you mock my misery? -- I Will make him know what it is
to abuse simple Innocence. He had no way to accomplish his wicked design, but
by promising to Marry me, and at the same time made me refuse the offers of a
good match in the Country, by which I incurred the displeasure of all my
Friends; and does he think to leave me now at last, without making some
provision for me? but he shall find that my Kinsman has money, and will stretch
his purse to right me by Law. -- for I have already given him an Account of his
ill usage to me


But I hope you have not told him how often he has enjoyed you, and the Where Is,
and the Whens


Sirrah, I shall teach you and your Master too, to use me with more Civility
ere it be long


Why truly, Mrs. Phebe, for all my Fooling I have a perfect sense of the
injuries he has done you, and have not been wanting in my persuasions to make
him less cruel; -- but I Will warrant you will refuse me a kiss now for all the
good Offices I have done you.


Away you impudent Raseal.


Come prithee tempt me no farther, for if you do, by Heaven I shall be most
desperately in Love with you


You in Love with me, you pitiful Creature!


Yes, faith Madam, I am your Creature as well as my Masters, and can satisfy
my appetite very well upon a dish after he has done with it, and you know the
Servingman is always allowed to break his Fast upon his Masters leavings -- Oh,
how Devilish hungry that frown makes me


You are no Impudent Rascal you?


Come, come, you know a good stomach needs no sauce, and you may save your self
the charge and trouble of going to Law, nor shall you need the assistance of
any other Friend, to make my Master do you reason, but your Friend and Servant
honest Watt


In good time.


Come take my Counsel, and if I do not handle matters so (if you will but join
with me) as shall content you, then say I Am a Man of no Abilities


How join with you?


In the next Room I Will show you; there I Will dictate a Letter, which you shall
write too him, which shall sting him to the quick


Nay I intended to write to him before I departed the house -- Oh Cousin, are
you come?


The Devil take this sniveling Cuckold for spoiling our sport. -- hark ye, Mrs.
Phebe, is this your Worshipful Knisman you told me of


I am the Gentleman, Sir, if you have any thing to say to me -- my Kinswoman
has told me all, and so pray tell your Master, and that he is a dishonest
Gentleman if he does not Marry her according to his promise; it is that I came
to demand in her right, or to denounce the Law against him


'Twas well, Sir, that you came too late to tell him so, for he would have so
swinged you else --


Oh, oh, Sir, these great Speeches cannot fright me, I neither fear, nor care
for swinging, I Will not be dashed, nor basht, nor cross him out of my Book for
such payments; for, Sir, take notice he is in my Books for Sixscore pounds, as
you can witness, tho you have lost the remembrance of me; -- but Sapientia mea
mihi; Stultitia tua tibi


Oh your Servant, sweet Mr. Saleware, I had indeed forgot you -- how does Mrs.
Saleware, your most beautiful Wife? the Flower de Luce of Pater Noster Row


No matter to you, Sir, how my Wife does; it is, my Kinswoman that I talk of,
whom your Master has deflowered, and deluded, and led into a Fools Paradise, as
the saying is, by swearing he would make her his Wife, and here he has held her
off, and held her on, till she is with Child by him, and I Will have you to know,
Sirrah, my Cousin is a Gentlewoman


Pray, Sir, how many Children have you, by your most exquisite Wife?


Why what is that to you? again Sirrah -- still meddling with my Wife?


I only spoke it, because you were talking of Children, Sir, -- but how shall I
know this is my Masters Child, if she has conceived


I shall make him know it is his. Come, come, there is Law to be had for money,
money to be had for Friends, Friends to be had in the Spiritual Court; and so,
if you please, you may tell your Master. Come, Cousin, come


But pray, Sir, give me leave to ask you one question: From whom does your
Cousin derive her Gentility? Is it from you or your Wife


Sirrah, you are a sawey Jackanapes, to offer to meddle with your betters; for
I Will have you to know, I am a Common Council Man, and as for my Wife, let me
advise you not to mention her but with respect, or I shall bring you, where you
shall be taught to mend your manners


I cry you mercy, Sir, I know she is for great Persons.


Are you at it again? Well, Sirrah, remember this. -- Come away, Cousin.


Why should you harbor so ill an opinion of me?


Your late unkindness is too visible; did you not take me in your Arms last
night, with exstasie? And when you discovered that 'twas I, you coldly turned
away, as if you had dreamt the while


Methinks you dream now, or else you could not talk so idly.


This will not do, for I Am resolved, I ll never let you rest, till I know what
it is has caused this Melancholy. -- I am sure, be it what it will, it has been
but very lately entertained. -- Come be free with me, have you entered into
Bonds for Friends, and are forced to satisfy 'em


No, no, prithee give over.


Or has any sad distaster befallen some dear Friend of yours?


Fie, fie.


Or is it your extravagant Nephews wicked Courses that afflcts you? -- I was in
hopes you had been Friends with him, you made your Friend Mr. Saveall and I
believe so. You said you would send for him; have you not? or do you repent the
promise which you made us


Neither, upon my life; when e're he comes, he shall be welcome to me, prithee
leave to be Inquisitive


Indeed I shall not, Sir, till I know:


Nay good wife --


No persuasion shall prevail, I will know it tho it be a sin against my self:
and I Will forgive it too


Now shall I play the Fool, and tell her.


You will not tell me then?


Yes, I will, if you will be so good as to forgive it, tho you are most
concerned to punish it


Sir, it is my duty to forgive any thing, and here again, I swear I will forgive
it


Let me confirm your mercy -- and on this Altar which I have transgrest, offer
new vows, of Love and Faith for ever.


Again, Sir, I forgive what ere it be.


I Will sin no more so, yet I scarce know a man that is not guilty this way --


Dear Husband, to the business. You Have loved a pretty Woman, Is It not so? I
mean -- unlawfu^ly? --


Your guess is right; and I expect my sentence.


Ha, ha, ha, what a Coil was here, about a thing of nothing? Where shall you
find from the Carman to the Statesman, one free from such a fault? --


And can you pardon it then?


Never fear it: tho I Have been jealous ever since your last being in Town.

-- But pray, how many Women -- have you thus loved? --


Upon my life but one.


Tell me her name; tho I fancy I suspect who it is already.


Saleware my Silkmans Wife.


It Is she I meant. Pray what price? for she is a handsome woman;


Faith after a tedious Courtship which she withstood, with much put-on Coyness
and feigned scorn, crying I had mistook my woman, she was not of that lewd sort
-- and so forth, at last I offered her a Hundred Guinies, which softened her
into a yielding; and then I once enjoyed her


I guess the time too. 'T was last Term when you stayed out all night, and said
you would been amongst the Wits


Still you guess right, -- but that for which I hate this jilting Queen, is,
having purchased her at such a price, I thought to have loved on still on the
old stock. But she turned tail -- and cried, Another Hundred Guinies; and
you're welcome; this answer I received but yesterday


O unmerciful! how rich would the City be, were every kindness that their Wives
granted, so returned and paid! Why, twould beggar the Court and Country. But
here comes Mr. Saveall and Mr. Careless, I believe. Faith it is a handsome
Gentleman --


Sir, I have according to your desire brought home your Nephew Careless; a
Penitent he is, and so I recommend him


George, thou art welcome, nor will I perplex thee with any upbraiding of thy
past offenses


I humbly thank you, Sir,


Nay, not so grave, good George: I Will have thee live with all thy wonted Spirit.
Leave but thy wonted lewdness and it is enough


Sir, they only served to teach me how I ought to be, by seeing my own
defermity in them, and I hope, have wrought that Effect in me which you desire
--


It Is well said, and, George, thank Mr. Saveall and your Aunt too, for they
were your Advocates


Hah! my Aunt! how beautiful she is!


Salute her, George --


I dare not, Sir, approach her.


I like that Modesty.


Nay, nay, Sir, he is transformed from what he was.


Madam, the goodness you have shown me, cannot be paid but with that reverence
and respect we pay to Heaven; for when I would approach you as a Lady to whom I
owe obedience as an Aunt, your bounty and your Beauty gives me Laws, and thus
commands my distance


This distance is too much. You Will be more welcome, if you approach more near.


I Would rather offend in my respect, than in my obedience, and since you command
it -- thus take the humble boldness -- Ah, she is a Heavenly creature --


George, -- come hither -- take notice; George, my house here is yours, my
table yours: and all my Servants to be commanded by you: -- but you have Watt
still


Yes, Sir, a very harmless honest true hearted Fellow it is: as I have
instructed him, he has left off swearing now, and can say Grace


It Is well. Send for him to wait on you: to morrow I Will pay your debts if you
owe any thing


Some few, Sir, hardly worth taking notice of: they shall not be your trouble
--


You speak well, Sir.


Well, George, what ere they be, they shall be paid. Come lead you Aunt in to
Dinner --


I Assure your Ladyship, there cannot be better ware in London, and your
Ladyship will find it such in the wearing


Have you made a Bill Mrs. Saleware? for I am satisfied in the goodness of your
Commodity; -- a Note of the particulars I pray: and at as low a Rate as you can
afford for ready money; for I am never in the City Books, like Heirs under age
and Courtiers


Your Ladyships pay was ever good, and I have made the Prices according. Here
it is, Madam --


Let me see -- Boy, take you the Box, it is all put up.


Yes, Madam.


Give me my Purse, Boy, and go you home with the Lace. I have only Gold, Mrs.
Saleware, which you will weigh before you take, I suppose.


That Is no great pains, Madam.


How ever I Will not give you the trouble now, -- pray send your man for a Glass
of beer --


Some beer for my Lady --


That I may take the opportunity to tell you, what possibly you would be loath
he should hear: -- for it is more the business of the Foreman of the Shop to
keep his Mistresses secrets


Your Ladyship is merry.


Not very merry, because I find by your Bill here that I have laid out more
money than my Husband allowed me: here is a Hundred and Eight Pounds and Two
shillings, and I am allowed but the Hundred


The rest is no great matter, Madam,


Oh, very great in a Norfolk Ladys Pocket: and would supply her Credit at
Picket, and Lantraloo a whole Christmas in the Country: tho you great Gamesters
of the City here, can lose and win your Hundreds, whilst it is so easily
commanded out of the Pockets of those Country-Ladys Husbands --


I understand not your Ladyship.


I Will tell you then: Sir Oliver, when he was last in Town, lent you, or left
with you, a Hundred Guinies, which he has given to me: now here is in the Bill
one Hundred and Eight Pounds and Two Shillings, so here is Twelve shillings for
you, and all is paid


What mean you, Madam?


Why, have you forgot the Money my Husband lent you? it is strange, when 'twas
to do you such a service


A service, Madam!


Yes, a service; have a care you don't make me suspect that you deserved it
from him some dishonest way


Please you to drink, Madam?


After you Mrs. Saleware. -- This Notes right cast up, Boy?


To a Farthing, Madam.


I hope your Ladyship will find your self so well used, that you will always be
pleased to Honor me with your Ladyships Custom


On these Terms always, Mrs. Saleware, and so, Your Servant.


Your Ladyship obedient. -- Open the Coach for my Lady.


My Footman's there, he need not.


Would your Coachman would carry your Ladyship to the Devil.


Hark you, Mrs. Saleware. -- sure it is the same.


Your command's an honor, Madam.


Do you know that Gentleman?


Yes, Madam, he is Gentleman to the Lord Loveless, and called Bellamy.


It Is a hansom youth, I thought I had seen his Face before. I commend you for
placing your Love here now: but an old Country Knight is a dangerous man; have
a care of such, for likely, they have handsome Ladys of their own; adieu sweet
Mrs. Saleware --


The Devil take her, how she shot Darts at Bellamy: she Loves the Beardless
Boy, this chaste Lady


Now, Madam, may I be heard?


Yes, if you please to speak.


But you are frowning, Madam, why do those Eyes put on such Marks of anger,
threatening a death to him, whom they have made their slave


Fie upon it, what stuff's this, I am out of Humor, and this will increase it.


Who durst offend you?


An unlucky accident that has happened to me, I have cozened my self in the
Sale of a parcel of Goods, which if my Husband should know, here would be such
a life --


Hang him Mercenary fool, why should he set you here to forward such mean Trade?


Ay, this talk pleases me.


Ranking his Wife but with his Prentices,


It Is very true, Mr. Bellamy: it is a mean thing as you say, but I have revenged
it to day, in the mistake I have made


I hope it was not much?


Not much; but so much as has spoiled a Shop-Trader of me: your Lord told me, I
should not be at this Servile pass long: that he would take me from it, and
carry me to the other End of the Town, and take me a House in the Pellmell --


He still designs it; -- If I prevent him not.


He said I should have new Cloths, too, and sent the Mercer to me with Patterns
of Brocados de or: but I have heard nothing on it since


Perhaps this Letter will satisfy you.

-- What a cursed office is this, to play the Pander for the man I love, I am
well born, and but for his slattery, had still remained with Honor and in
Virtue: but his bewitching tongue wrought on my easine's, and robbed me of my
Fame: -- 'twas well in this disguise I was concealed, my sister else had knowri
me, and then I Would been undone: it is this -- that keeps me too, concealed, from
the false Loveless, who takes me for a Boy, and makes me do what even in this
bold shape I am ashamed to Act, to Pimp for him: -- Oh heavens! that word --
but I Will prevent his longer doting here; to wast his fortune and his love on
one, common, ungrateful, and insensible


O what a sweet Letter's here, and yet I have a kind of a mind to this Bellamy
too -- at Shatliens at six, good -- -- Sir, I find my Lord is all honor.


But, Madam will you think on me that languish for you.


Because I am kind to your Lord, you imagine I must be so to you? but I would
have you to know I am none of those: I am not fallen from his favor yet, or if I
were, I should not fall to Pages -- there be more Lords


Madam, you have silenced me.


Nay, not so hasty, come back Mr. Bellamy.


Can you take his money forsooth? -- do you hear, Sir.


Stay you behind the Counter, Sirrah; cannot I handle the Gentleman without
you? -- What, fly for my first denial? -- Come, let a smile encourage you again
--


Oh how you bless me! --


-- Come, come, leave off to talk like a Player, and if you have a passion for
me, let me know it -- Are you ashamed? that blush would seem to say so -- come
then, whisper it in my ear --

Oh strange, is that the highest price you dare venture? I cannot, Sir, afford
it so: yet this -- before you go -- I Am sure you cannot match it.


I shall forget my duty to my Lord --


Prithee do so, and so will I, and tell me what you would have me to do with
you


I would entreat you --


Forward, Sir, without a blush.


That you would vouchsafe --


To do what, I pray?


To wear this Watch by your side -- and every minute think of me.


I could have done that without all this entreaty -- is this all?


No, there is something more, but when I think how fair you are, and what a
blessing my Lord injoys in you --


Prithee no more of him: but ask me something.


I dare not hope you can grant me any thing.


Why so?


Because you love my Lord so well.


Perhaps not when he is present -- but tell me what is it?


That you would be pleased --


I am pleased.


To grace this Ring with your fair hand.


And what hurt will that be to your Lord? -- come, come, I must divine your
meaning now, and what returns I must make you for all these presents -- but --


But -- you will be cruel and betray me to my Lord.


But I will not, though I have you at my mercy; for it is evident you would lie
with me -- deny it if you can


Did I name such a word now? I swear you make me blush.


Then you're a fool; come, take courage, and be more a man, for you shall --


What shall I?


Why you shall -- you understand me, do what I said you wished to do.


Oh how happy you will make me!


But it is on this condition.


Let it be what it will I Will do it.


Why you saw here e'n now, a young Lady.


What of her?


It Is my Lady Thrivewell.


Wife to Sir Oliver Thrivewell?


Yes; it seems you know her then.


I have seen her, I think, when she was a Maid.


Well, she is passionately in love with you -- you saw her speak to me, and how
unwilling she was to go, and lose the pleasure of looking on you


What does all this tend to?


Nay, I speak against my self, to oblige that sweet person, which few women do;
but I have particular reason for it, and you must make love to her. You know
what I mean


Alas, how should I get access?


O, my Lord's to borrow money of her husband, and you're to be employed, I know
upon the Message, then you will have opportunity, and she being willing, the
business may soon be done: -- and it is the only way to win my love


This is to try my constancy.


I vow I do not, but will be yours entirely, when this is done; -- but see my
husband: -- We must sup to night at Shaltines


How does my dear Ali.? -- Mr. Bellamy, your servant, I hope my Honored Lord's
well. Why what, you are not brisk and gay! I hope my wife has not cozened you
in any Wares; or are you and she upon some bargain, that you cannot agree
about? You must comply with Mr. Bellamy, my sweet Aly. he is my Noble Lord's
Favorite, and must be used well, and shall, whether I am within or without
doors


Sir you mistake, and I must take my leave.


What an Asenego's this? he might a returned my Complement, though I care not a
fart for him. I hope thou have cozened him indeed, Ale


Thomas, you are mistaken, Thomas, -- in setting me to cousen any body; I am
weary of this sneaking Trade, Thomas, and of this taudrum City dress, Thomas,
as I have often told you, Thomas; but you think a wife should obey her husband


Never the sooner for a hasty word, sweet heart; but for these Tawdrums, as you
call them, I say, they are the City-fashion: yet you may follow your own humor,
and my Lord's fancy, as I promised before I had you


Why, that is well said, Friend.


Nay, now I am sure she is pleased, she calls me Friend, she ever did so when
she was in good humor

-- But, Friend, I have found a chapman for the Lace my Lord Lack-Land bespoke,
and wanted money to pay for: a chapman that will buy it all


I have sold it, Friend, already.


How, Friend, and is it paid for?


Yes, it is paid for.


Well, it comes as pat to stop a Gap.


It has stopped a gap already. I have bought me things I wanted, fine Clothes,
and Tours, and Points and Knots, and --


And -- never the sooner for a hasty word.


It Is so, Friend, what City-Wife can draw in Customers to her Shop, that is not
Lady-like? and therefore I have done it


Say you so, say you so? --


What are you angry at it?


I were a beast if I should -- no, no, Friend, I am not angry: let it go -- and
sapientia mea mihi, is my Motto


Well Thomas, look to your Shop, for I must go abroad.


Pray whither?


How, dare you ask that question?


I am Corrected. Sam, wash your Face, and get your Cloak and Gloves and wait on
your Mistress


I Will have no Sam, to tell you all he fees: In good time, is that friendly? --


I am again Corrected, but you will return by supper time?


Again are you at it?


I Have don, I Have don.


I Will neither come to supper, nor to bed, perhaps.


Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope.


Nor when I do come home, you shall not ask me, Where I have been, what I have
done, or what Company I had


No, no; sapientia mea mihi, I say still.


Are not we in another world, Watt? And have not I improved my time well,
already, look you here, firrah?


-- It Is a comfortable sight, Sir, may it long continue so.


I Will score no more Reckonings in Taverns now, nor hide my self in Privileged
places, to prevent the Alarms of damnable Duns, that besiege a Chamber Door as
soon as day. I owe nothing now, Boy, and here is delicious Gold, besides,
substantial Metal -- hark, how it rings. --


Yes, 'twill ring the Changes shortly.


So let it, Watt, for necessaries -- and chime all out too, for I can manage my
Uncle now, and drain new showrs when this is gone


And do you call Claret, Whores, Hectors, and Fiddlers, Necessaries?


Why yes, or the devil's in it.


What, Sir, shall go for Pious Uses, for you will have little left?


Pious Uses! Art mad?


No, Sir, but I call it a pious thing, to have regard in some degree to your
poor whore Phebe; she will come railing home else, and spoil all


She cannot injure me, the World's my own. Does not all the House adore me? the
Servants and the Tenants call me young Master. Does not my Uncle let Leases,
take Mortgages, and let Money in my Name? And has he not taken care I shall
have a thing, called a Wife, worth ten thousand pound? And can I fear the
Clamor of a little whore, think thou? -- No


It Is very well, Sir, and I admire your luck, but most, to see the fine young
Lady, your Aunt, so kind to you; Why she outdoes your Uncle that way


She shall be no loser by that, I have resolved she shall not go un-rewarded by
me


But still, Sir, Mrs. Phebe is forgotten.


You are, methinks, damnable careful of Mrs. Phebe, but I have answered here
her impudent Letter she sent me, wherein she desired me to marry her, a Pox
upon her: -- Here, carry it her, with these ten Guineys, but do not give them
her, till she promise to write, nor come no more, till I think fit to send to
her


That may be long enough, for ought I know.


Why, faith it may be so: for I must leave off this lewd whoring life, for
reasons I have


I Sir, I should like it well, if you would do so, and make it your business to
court the Widow in an honorable way; you were about her once, and I think not
ill received; Faith, Sir, try her gain. --


Well, well, Sir, go you about your business. --


I Am gone, Sir. --


Mr. Saveall, I see you are a man of Honor, and mean to keep your word in
carrying a Letter to the Widow for me -- here it is -- ready. --


It is discreetly done, Mr. Careless.


Faith I have been hard employed, writing News into the Country, to several
persons of Quality, of how Affairs stand in Court and City: of News of State,
and News of Gallantry, all, all that has come within my knowledge


A handsome and commendable Employment, and will improve your knowledge, and in
time you may become a Parliament Man, and assist in the great Affair of the
Rule of the Nation


When I am married, Sir, I shall take up.


I shall be over joy'd to see such good effects of my negotiation of this
business


Faith, Sir, I am unused to write to Ladys, and a little awkard in such
matters, but I shall mend with practice. In the mean time I beseech you, Sir,
to beg my pardon for the roughness of the Language


To the most Incomparable, and most Virtuous Crosstil, present. -- The outside
is handsome, and promises the inside to be courtly and civil


Pray Heaven she have the same opinion of it: which with your kind
interpretation may do much


I shall not be wanting to say all things to your advantage, and doubt not but
I shall prevail in your behalf


Oh, Sir, how you continue your goodness!


Well, Sir, expect me and your Fortune modestly early in the morning.


Your Servant, Sir. Now the Devil takeme if can wish him good luck, only ten
thousand pound is a most delicious sum: -- But who comes here? my Aunts
Governant? how very like a Bawd she would look in any other place? but being an
Attendant on my Aunt -- I may be mistaken


Not to interrupt your Cogitations, Sir, I have here from my Lady brought you.
--


What dear Closett, any thing from her is precious --


A Caudle, Sir, the same her Ladyship eats to strengthen her. O, it is a most
profitable Cordial Restorative; I made it, Sir, my self.


How am I obliged to her Generosity, which so far exceeds my merits!

How she graces me in all companies, and conversation, with her particular
Favors: recommending me, and commending me to all the Ladys that pay her
visits: Then what a care she takes of my Lodging, my Chamber, Furniture, my
Table dressed up, my fine Twilights, my Persumes, and my Plate: and what not? --
Why here are rich things in this Caudle too. --


Have you perceived that? I Will assure you, theirs Amber Greece. --


Ah! Closett, what pity 'twas this fair young Aunt of mine was not married to
a young man


Alas, Sir! Aye, great pity.


She is the Charmingst Lady!


Indeed she is so, Sir, I have known her, and served her from a Child, and then
she was a Charming Child: And as she grew toward Woman she was a Charming
Maid. And now she is a charming Lady, as you say, Sir: And could I live to see
a Child of hers, I should think I had lived long enough, unless I might live to
see that have Children too: which I could wish withal my heart


I had rather see you at the Devil, and your Charming Lady too; but I hope my
Uncles Impotence; or her honesty, will preserve her from my curse


-- But, alas Sir, I shall never see her have one --


That Is excellent.


Say you so, Sir, -- because 'twill hinder your being Heir? But, I thought you
had valued your Aunt above all that


So I do, Closett, I spoke of the bottom of the Caudle: that that was Excellent;

-- But, do think there are no ways, Closett, to get my Aunt with Child?


Ways? Yes, yes, Sir, there are ways enough, did not her too nice Virtue spoil
all


Can not thou persuade her to her good?


How, Sir?


Nay, do not mistake me, Closett, -- By this good Guiney, I meant no harm, --


No, in my Conscience, Sir, yon spoke in pure Love to your Aunt.


-- Nay, -- nay, -- Nay, you shall take it; Nor do I care if thou tell my
Aunt, how dearly I love her, and how well I wish her: Nay, Gad and she were not
my Aunt, tell her, I had rather get her a Son and Heir, than inherit all my
Uncles Estate my self


Good heart! how passionately, and honestly he speaks! Well, it is a good thing
to be grateful:


Alas! that is my Lady calls.


Kiss her dear hands from me, -- and tell her -- oh, tell her, that -- I know
not what, I love her so, I cannot express it


I had forgot her message to you, I have the dullest brain of my own --


What was it?


My Lady entreats you would --


That I would? -- with all my Soul, I would --


My Lady, desires you --


Thy Lady desires me? By Heaven, and she shall have me.


Lord, Sir, she desires you, --


The Devil take me, if I do not desire her too, for all she is wife to my Uncle.


Will you not hear me out, Sir? she desires you to go abroad with her.


Oh, any whither, to Chelsey, -- Knights-Bridge, -- Branford, -- Geernwich, I
know all the convenient houses at every place; and will be as secret --


I do not understand you, Sir.


The Pox take this tongue of mine, it will be talking in the wrong place. --


Well, Sir, you will go with my Lady, I Will tell her.


I will: Tell her, she shall command my life.


Closett, you make good have.


Madam, I was just coming. But, Mr. Careless, was talking so affectionately of
your ladyship, and so tenderly, that methoughts, I could have stayed a whole
day to have heard him


I am obliged to him. But, Nephew, you must go abroad with me, to the Park, and
to the Exchange; if you can leave your Study so long


All the world to wait on you. My dear Aunt, I have no Business, that can or
shall hinder me, from sacrificing the whole time I have to live, to your
Service


Dear George, use less Complement to me.


Give it a kinder name, I do beseech you. --


Come, the Coachman waits, and we shall have no time between this and Supper.
You must not talk now, good Nephew


I Am all obedience Madam, -- but a Pox on it, I must meet my Gang at the Rose to
night. --


O that Heaven had sent my Lady such a Husband.


MOney, ye Sons of Whores? ask me for money? As if, George Careless ever paid
Coach, or Chair Men -- unmerciful Villains -- money -- no, no! This is not an
Age of Payment

A Pox of the cautious Fool,
That limits his time, and his Glass:
Who drinks, and who Wenches by rule,
Is Damned for a Cynical Ass.
But give me the Boy that is gay,
Whose time is his slave, and will drink
Beyond the dull limits of day,
And never from his Company shrink.
-- Who Is yonder? -- Old Sim -- my Uncles Butler? -- a -- very honest --
Fellow, -- now is he diligently sleeping for my coming home, and most carefully
-- and kindly left the Door open for me: -- So, ho, ho, -- Old Simon, -- so,
ho, ho, -- up, up, dull Mortal

I have use for thee. -- Lord,! Lord! -- what Sots and Beasts, some Men make of
themselves, to sleep away half that short life Heaven has given them! -- What
will this wicked World come too? -- Why Sim, ye drowsy Slave, up I say, --


Au, Au. --


Why, Sim, ye Son of a Whore, is this a time to sleep in? Open thine Eyes, --
behold me, and guess what Business I have for thee


Au, au, -- anon, Sir.


Nay now, good Sim, now. --


Shall I never sleep more?


Unconscionable Simon, no reason in thy Sleep? -- Come hither, Sim, -- I have
honest -- lawful business for thee, -- prithee -- fetch me a Whore. --


It Is my young Master George's voice, Au, -- au, -- deliver me well out of this
lewd Town again, that I may have my fill of Sleep, and Pudding. Au, au, --
mercy on me, who is here? Aye, it is he, my young Master George, at this late
hour


You lie, Sim, you lie, -- it is early --


So it should be, by my blinking Candle. -- But how, Sir, came you in this
lamentable pickle


How do you mean, Sir? --


Why, Sir, where is your Sword, and Periwincle? -- sure you have been Fighting,
Sir


Only kicked a Couple of Chair-men -- that, had the impupudence (would thou
think it, Sim,) to ask me money


Alas, Sir, that they should offer it --


I, to me. Sim! -- me that always bilk the Slaves. --


The Constable and Watch! well, a my Conscience he never came home in's life
but 'twas thus attended


These, -- these, -- are the Sons of Whores, that had the Impudence to ask me
money

I. Cha Your Worship was mistaken, we scorn to ask your Worship money, we know
you better then ^o, as they say, ^^. But, -- if your Worship would be pleased
to give us something o drink your Worships health, after our cold sitting up
all Night, we should be bound to your Worship


Alas, poor Devils! Sim, give 'em a Guiney to drink. But no paying, good Sim,
it is an ill Precedent. --


Good Mr. Simon, consider us, for we have waited all night at the Rose Door;
and he fearing only that we would ask him money, fell on us, and beat us, we
disarmed him, and then to Cuffs we went: I protest, Sir, no Fault of ours


Well, get you gone: and come again anon, and you shall be paid.


God bless your Worship.


Come, Sir, will you not please to go to Bed? -- it is broad day light, and
you will wake your Uncle, and you know that may be fatal to you


My Uncle! Damn my Uncle. -- Sim, I tell thee in private, my Uncle's an old
Cuckold; do hear? a Cuckold, Simon. --


God forbid, Sir, my Lady's a Virtuous Lady, tho I say it.


Why so she is too, Sim, -- but I speak of my Uncle -- I say, -- and I say,
again -- he is a Cuc-Cuckold, -- or shall be a Cuckold before I have done, Sim,
-- my conscience urges me to it. -- 'twill be a work of great Humility, and
Charity, and this is a wicked world, Sim, -- a very wicked world; and it is time
some should mend for Example, -- and now we talk of mending, Sim, -- fetch me a
Whore. --


A Whore, Sir? --


I, Sim, a Whore. --


Bless me, Sir! Why we have nonei'th' house, nor can fetch any out of Doors.


Sim, you lie, -- Sim, -- do not give your mind to lying, 'twill spoil thee, --
no Whores in the house, -- why where is Mrs. Figit, my Ladies woman? Doll the
Chambermaid? Starcht Susan, of the Landry? or greasy Bess, that is under the
Cook? Or my Ladies Nurse, old Winter? -- Or where is my Lady her self? she will
serve now. -- No Whores in the house


Deliver me! What do you mean, Sir?


What all sober discreet persons should mean, to know all the she-things in the
house, -- therefore, Sirrah, fetch me a Whore; or I shall untile, -- I shall.
--


O hold, Sir, I would not for the world you should be heard.


Hold! hold! there is a Female, -- come hither, Wench, -- come hither, -- I say.
-- Why you drunken Baggage, cannot you stand still


Pox on you, he could no sooner ask for a Whore, but you must bolt out. --


I was going to clean up my Kitchen. --


Hang thy Kitchen, thou must along with me, I have need of thee. --


Any service that I can do that is honest, Sir. --


Honest, I, I, we'll be very honest, -- thou shall only go to Bed with me a
little; dear Bess, let me kiss thee. Bess, let us up. --


I hope you do not take me for a Whore, Mr. George?


A Whore, -- why what would you be taken for, a Cherubin? -- Can I take thee
for a Nobler Creature


Ah, fie upon you, Mr. George, I did not think you had the Face to seduce a
young thing as I am. -- Well, my Lady shall know it


Come away, I say, -- come, -- you do not know what I design you, when my
Nuncle dies. --


I, when will that be, trow?


Can not thou put a little ingredient into his Potage? -- That will do his
business, and send him to Heaven without the help of a Doctor, -- and then --


And what then?


Then, I Will marry thee, by this hand, marry thee. -- Come away, and do not stand
in thy own light


Tell him you will come, you Slut.


Well, Sir, you have overcome me; go you to bed, and I ll but pull off my
Shoes, and steal up to you presently


Sim, will she keep her word?


I, I warrant you, Sir; we have all found her a kind soul, and honest in that
point, tho I say it. Pray go to bed


Give me some wine first. --


Wine, Sir? you have had Wine enough of all conscience, a vast quantity of
Wine, a vast quantity


What thou take me to be drunk now, I Will warrant, do thou? No, Sim, I have
that rare quality, -- the more I drink the soberer I am, it is a Miracle to me
now that, -- therefore give me some Wine, to set me right, that I may look thus
-- gravely on my Uncle


Nay, pray, Sir, go to Bed, --


Dam me, Sim, I Will have your Leathern Ears, if I have no wine. So, ho, some
Wine you Rascal -- some Wine.


Ah, good. Sir, speak softly.


Softly, you Bitch? -- why who do I fear? Softly! -- there is softly for you, --
and there is hola. --


I, I, Sir, you shall not hear me cry out, for all your Kicking -- for your
sake. --


Softly, quoth a, I Will softly ye. --


So here is fine doings! you will be turned out for this anon, and I after you for
my kindness in setting up for you all night.


Now am I compassionate, -- dear Sim, come kiss me, -- kiss me, I say. -- Why
you scurvy coy Rascal, why don't you kiss me? -- So dry your Eyes, and hear me
sing a Song that will make thee weep afresh, -- Listen with reverence

There was two Cats sat on a Well,
And one Cat there fell in;
But the Cat that sat by,
Wept bitterly;
Because that Cat was the other Cats Cousin Germin.
But the Cat, etc.

Ha, ha, ha, I suppose you know the inside of this, Mr. Saveall?


No, Madam, but I believe it passionate and Courtly, as he that sent it: only
indeed he commanded me to excuse the roughness of the Style, he being unused to
write Epistles of this Nature


Ha, ha, ha. Pray Sir, read it: you must be acquainted with his excellent Style.


I am overjoyed to see her so well pleased; would I had brought it last night.


Read aloud, Sir, for I can never be weary of hearing it.


Thou damnable impudent Woman, -- hah, -- how dare thou, tho but in thy
Dreams, imagine I am, or can be so great a Coxcomb as to marry thee; a sin which
thou art Damned for but believing. --

-- O Heavens! the Devil himself was sure his Secretary.


O Sir, proceed I pray.


Do thou not hear I am again established in my Uncles favor, and do thou
think I can want 5 or 10 Guinies to give a Wench, or that there are not Wenches
to be found for such Sums; that I must be destined to marry you with a Pox. --


I, I, 'twas the Devil that Dictated to him.


Pray on, Sir.


No, therefore let me advise you, since you are so mad for a Husband, (tho I
believe you love me, and only me,) marry a Blockhead, either in the City, or
Country, that thinks there is Joys in Marriage, and I may chance to be so kind
to be your Friend, by the by; and so you may have Children, like Yours, (that
way,) G. Careless


You have not read many such Love Letters.


This injury to you, Madam, is irreparable; but the affront done to me I Will
fight him for


Oh, Sir, he has obliged me beyond expression, and I beseech you tell him so:
nay I Am in earnest. -- For what concerns your self, do what you please


I do unsay all I said in his behalf, and beg your pardon. --


It Is all one, Sir, I love him still the better; and tell him, this Letter has
made such impressions here, as nothing can remove: and if you will oblige me
indeed, you must bring him to me, and let me alone to speak to him, and tell
him of his Letter


Sure you're not in earnest, Lady?


By my life, I am, and I beseech you credit me, and bring him to me to day;
bring him in good humor too, and then I Will say you are my friend indeed. --


I will not fail you, Lady.


Was there ever so extravagant a creature as this Careless?


Madam, will you not be revenged on him?


Yes, Betty, the most severe way that ever woman took. -- I Will love him! love
him to that degree, he shall confess no hate was ever so perplexing


I confess, Madam, you were ever of a contradictive humor, and possibly you will
love him the better, because he has affronted you


I do so, and am all impatience till I see him. Prithee give me the Song he
made to me the last time he was in the Country. --

Prithee, Widow, give over, I cannot comply,
What shall I lie mewed, and kept tame till I die?
A Pox of the noose, and the fools it has made,
I never can submit to keep up the dull trade.
In Wine and in Love, I will spend all my life,
Give me the kind Damsel, and damn the Fop-wife.
In Wine and in Love, etc.

It Is a mere folly to go to bed now, it is time to rise. -- Well, Simon, well,
thou art bound to give God thanks, thou were not born a Gentleman, -- some
comfort that. -- Mercy upon us, what lives they lead! never rise till three of
the clock after noon, (or very rarely) and then they are damnable dry, and
crop-sick, -- but not at all hungry, so they lose both breakfast and dinner,
(two great blessings;) instead of Prayers, the first words they speak, as soon
as awake, are -- Damn me, how cursed drunk was I last night! Hay, Jack -- some
small Beer, you Vermin, -- (very fine) -- well -- at last he gets himself
dressed, calls for his Coach (and not a word of dinner) rouls to Playhouse, to
that that has the bawdiest Play (for that settles his stomach,) tells as many
as he meets (that he knows) how he was clawed away last night, but forswears
drinking again, for at least a day or two; then spys me a Vizard, over the
benches he stalks, and there thunders a deal of lewd bawdy, till he has won her
heart quite; away they go, sup and get drunk in spite of vows of sobriety, and
then to some convenient Mansion of pleasure, where they spew and snore away the
remaining part of the night, and then comes repentance, and never till then have
they any grace before their eyes


Mr. Simon, where is your precious young Master?


So, my precious young Master; he has heard of his mornings revel-rout. -- Sir,
I know you are dissatisfied, as you have reason, but as you have ever been, be
so good to pardon this fault too


Pardon him! I Would sooner pardon the man should cuckold me. No, Sir, where is he?


Alas, Sir, you know he has not been abed above an hour or two, it is pity to
disturb him


So, the old trade too still; I say, he must be disturbed, and that quickly
too, or I shall make a soul house, -- and so tell him


Why, Lord, Mr. Saveall! --


Lord me no Lords, Mr. Simon, I say I will speak to him, go tell him, or I Will go
to him, on such a message as shall not please him very well


Well, Sir, I Will go, though it grieves my heart to wake him.


This affront has raised an unusual storm in my breast, had not the Lady been
of my acquaintance, and the Match of my proposing, it had never grieved me: My
comfort is, she is so humorous, that this Letter will rather bring her on, than
put him off: but what she will think of me the while -- it is for that I will be
revenged, that I may let her see I had no hand in it


Oh, Mr. Saveall --


Make your self ready.


Faith, I sat up a little late last night. --


Dress you, I say.


Dress me, for what? it is too early.


The better, Sir. --


Why does the Widow intend to marry me instantly?


No, Sir, but I intend to fight with you.


How, Sir?


Bless my soul, here is fine doings!


What injury have I done you, that you should ruin my Reputation?


How, Sir?


You have put me on a base employment, to carry a Letter to a Noble Lady, stuffed
with such Language, as your Lust, the Devil and all your Cabal of Hectors could
never have invented such another

Could not your Pimp there -- serve for the base Office?


I do not understand you.


You had better have eaten fire, or sent it with your ears, than have provoked
me thus by being the Messenger.


Forbear, and hear me, Sir, before you take a resolution to abandon me: If I
must lose the Widow, by Heaven it is by the most unlucky mistake in the world.
-- Watt, come hither, -- Did you carry the Letter I sent to Phebe


Yes, Sir, and the poor soul's overjoyed at the good News you sent her.


The Devil take her for a lucky whore. That Letter, Sir, was it I writ to the
Widow, and that which you carried was meant for this Damsel: I know it is so


How could it be possible you should so mistake?


Sealing them before I had superscrib'd them, a Pox upon me: and to be charged
with rudeness to the Widow, -- when I was so religiously bent to lead a
virtuous Matrimonial life. -- The Letter, Sir, (for I Will confess to you) was
written to a poor retaining whore of mine, whom I have turned off


It was not so directed.


No, no, Sir, there was the mistake; and Fortune's always kind to whores, those
of her own trade. -- Well, hang me, if 'twere not the sweetest well-pen'd
thing, -- Sirrah, go and fetch it back


Lord, Sir, she will n'ere part with it.


Then take it by force, you Rogue you.


What force, Sir?


Thus, you dog, -- thus. --

This was a Plot of yours, sirrah, I believe you lie with her, you are so
ready to cheat me to serve her -- but I Will be revenged on you both.


I, I, now we may go hang, now you are in favor with Sir Oliver -- but if I do
not fit you for it --


I am in your debt for being absent last night too, and letting Sim sit up for
me, whom Iabus'd. -- A rogue --


It Is all upon account, Sir. --


No more, Mr. Careless, it is sufficient and since 'twas a mischance, I am
pacified, and will set you right with the Widow again


But then she I know of this Mistress I have had, -- but the truth is, it is now
grown so common a thing amongst the married men too, as well as the Gallants,
that she cannot but forgive it, I think. -- But who is here? my Aunt with a
young handsome fellow; she is undrest too, Death! now am I jealous, -- but for my
Uncles sake, -- I must needs beat him


By no means, Sir, I would not have you commit such an outrage in your Aunts
presence, and your Uncles house, for all the world


You do not know him, Sir?


Yes, Sir, I do, he is both friend and servant to a person of Honor, whom I
value, the Lord Loveless


Mr. Saveall, I must speak with you.


In the name of pleasure, what is this stripling employ d for to my Aunt? I
perceive they have been in private too together, not so much as Bawd Closset to
overlook 'em: it is a pretty youth, and I must beat it, when I see time
convenient


Mr. Saveall, pray speak to Sir Oliver, for my Lord is going to marry a rich
Fortune, and will redeem his mortgaged Land that is forfeit to Sir Oliver


Six hundred pound, you say, Madam? -- I will get it done for his Lordship.


Here Is a pretty come-off! as if he were chamber'd up with her all this while
to borrow money: Ah woman, woman, what Politics you have


Your servant, Mr. Bellamy.


I go your way, Sir, and will wait on you.


I would wait on him too. --


George, come back -- whither go you?


To bring the young Gentleman to the gate.


Oh, you are too ceremonious, George, -- it is below you.


So; I am instructed, Madam. --


You know not whose servant he is.


So, she loves him, I know it by her slighting him. --

Oh, Madam, there are Lords servants that may deserve the favor of Knights
Ladies


Not so, good George.


As the Lady may like 'em, Madam.


Sure you're not sober yet, George, or melancholy. -- I hope nothing troubles
you


Not much, Madam.


Come, come, I know your grief, you think I am angry with you for the pickle
you came home in last night, or rather this morning: but I excused your absence
to your Uncle, pretending I had sent you to my Brother's, five mile out of
Town, to do a little business for me: and you may see I am not much displeased
by that, though you were with your blades, George


Did you do me this good office to my Uncle?


Yes indeed, and he believed me.


Could you be so good? -- Indeed I was amongst 'em, but will be better tempered
for the future


I shall be glad to see it, for your own sake.


I will obey your will in every thing.


Oh, had you beheld your self, and how you were hung together.


A drunkard is a beast, but I Will be so no more. --


That Is well promised; and I Will reward it thus, George, there is a small stock of
Gold. --


Dear Aunt, let me kiss the hand from whence such bounty flows.


Not to afflict you with all you said and did: I will only chide you for
calling for whores, George


Oh Lord! why did I? did I? what a wicked dog was I!


You frighted poor old Sim, with Fetch me a whore: -- the poor wretch blessed
himself, and cried, -- There was none in the house! then you roared out, How! no
whores in the house? where is Figet? where starcht Susan? where is Doll, greasy
Bess, or old Winter? meaning Closet, or my Lady her self? -- No whores! -- But
why me, George, up in your Catalogue


God forgive me, was I so profane a Rogue? such an unhallowed Rascal?


Yes, consider it well, George, and lay it to your heart, so fine, so handsome
a young Gentleman to spoil himself with such lewd courses, it is great shame and
pity


A Pox on this damned Wine, it is that debauches me to all the other sins.


It Is true, had you not been drunk, you would never have meddled with so sad a
dirty creature, as Bess the scullion. --


I, that is it she is most offended at, she is not displeased I called for her
Ladyship last night; she presents me too with Gold: I will apprehend her
meaning: -- she would have me leave off debauching, and give her a proof of my
passion and my manhood. --


Come, come, be not melancholy, though, George, for I would have you still gay
and pleasant, though not lewd


Madam, you have reformed my soul, and now I beseech you take the fruits of
your good advice: I am all yours


How mean you?


As I say, the most passionate Lover, the most secret Servant, that ever was
blessed with a Lady's favor


Sure, Sir, you are not well?


Not well? Gad I defy all the Surgeons in London, that can say the contrary --
I am found, as a Bell. --


Not well in your senses, Sir.


Do you doubt my secrecy? I Will never be drunk more to endanger my blabbing in
that humor. My Uncle shall never know it


Can you name your Uncle, and yet pursue me this shameful way?


Who the Devil can do you this kindness more naturally and less sinfully than
my self? am I not his own flesh and blood


Surely you do but rally?


By Heaven I am in earnest: try. In earnest? yes. -- Come let me lead you to my
chamber, -- and give you the first clear proof of my entire passion. --


I know you can but jest.


I Will convince you above. -- Dear, Madam, come.


And would you wrong your Uncle?


Why do you name him? he is not so just to you, you may Cuckold him with less
sin, than lie with him; for then you are in danger, for he is a spark abroad, I
can assure you


How can you tell?


Oh, I have heard it every where. -- But what needs all this Ceremony? -- come
let us up. --


Unhand me. If you provoke me, I Will undo you. --


She Is angry, -- what a Pox, have I mistaken her?


Is this the best construction you can make of all my kindness to you?


Pox on it, I am not mistaken in her neither, but


Well, I see a penitence in your face, George, for what you have done; and if
it is true, I can easily forgive you; -- but here comes my woman. --


The Devil take her.


Madam. --


Look that you never tempt me so again.


Then I must dye, unless you will yield without it.


Look handsomely, and do not betray your self, and for once you are safe.


So, she will come about again.


Well, go Cousin, and do that Affair for me I spoke of.


I go, Madam, I have my instructions all?


Yes, George, if you can remember. --


Oh, witty Devil, how she has turned the discourse! by which I find she puts no
faith in old Maulkeena there: I love her invention.


Now what is the news with you?


A Citizen waits to speak with you, Madam.


Who is it?


Mr. Saleware, Madam.


Sure his Aly has impudently told him what I have done.


There Is a Gentlewoman too, Madam.


Bring 'em in.


Madam, I humbly desire a word or two with your Ladyship, concerning my Cozen
Phebe here: She Is abused by a Gentleman that lies here, as I understand; Mr.
Careless, Madam, who has damaged her much


Indeed!


Read this, Madam, 'twill inform you of the truth of what I say, -- hold up
your head, Phebe, we'll not be dashed in a good Cause. --


Madam,

My Uncle's favor has encouraged me to make my humble adresses to you in the
way of holy Marriage, I shall not be altogether unworthy the Honor of being
your Husband, since I may justly enough hope my Estate may be suitable to your
desires: It Is long that I have had a passion for you, and impatient till I find
whether 'twill be received well by you. If you vouchsafe to do so, I shall not
only declare my self a good and grateful Husband, but live the happyest of all
men

Ever yours, G. Careless.

This is so far from injury, that me thinks it is very kind.


O but Madam, he is gone from his word, and denies this his Act and deed, like
a disloyal man; and having born her in hand thus long, would now cast her off:
Sent his man to ravish the Letter from her, but never the sooner for a hasty
word. Cousin, we'll not be dashed nor basht, I Will warrant thee


To the fair hands of Mrs. Phebe Gimcrack. -- Is that your name?


I am the wretched thing that owns it, Madam.


Never the sooner for a hasty word.


I will endeavor to serve you, Mr. Saleware, -- if I knew how.


O Lord, Madam, you are discreet, and if your Ladyship takes this matter in
hand, I doubt not but to see my Cousin happy, and a good end of the business;
but if it cannot be, I shall find Friends, nor shall her Cause be starved for
want of moneys, as they say: For we will not be dashed, nor basht; Sapientia mea
mihi, is my word, and so dear Madam, I have discharged my mind


Well, Mr. Saleware, I Will take care of your Kinswoman, and do my best for her.


I humbly thank you, Madam. Phebe, do you mind me? Bear your self to this Noble
Lady handsomely, and high, as becomes the Family you came off; She may chance do
you more good than all my high talking: I pray carry it high; -- or, --
Sapientia mea mihi, Stultitia tua tibi; that is my Motto


O doubt not me, Sir; nor my Carriage. --


Closett, take this young Woman up to your Chamber, and treat her well; I will
do something for her: doubt not, Mr. Saleware.


How I shall be bound to your Ladyship. Sapientia, is my Motto. --


I see you design to kill me, you would not else let me be a witness to those
Joys, which my Lord only reaps, and must look on and languish for, to conduct
you to him; after that undress you, and lay you, -- O, I dare not name where,
but, would I might never live to see him embrace you more


Come, come, you shall not soften me so, you dissembling thing you?


By all that is good, I am not, I speak truth. -- O how you lay this morning
wrapped in his dear embraces. --


Well, and did not you come from being wrapped in dear embraces too, those of my
Lady Thrivewell? -- once more, let me hear the pleasing story


O if you loved me, as you say, you could not take a pleasure in hearing what
Joys I took with another


Joys which you give, I can. Come let me hear how kind she was, and how well
she liked you


So well she liked me, that she swore and I believed her, she never liked her
Husband half so well


Some other man perhaps she did.


She vowed, and I again believed; she never knew a man besides her Husband. --


And your self, -- but then she was kind?


Very kind.


And could you, -- when you pretended to me, could you? Ah you're a cozening
thing


Inspired with thoughts of you; I was grateful to her Ladyship, and she in
requital to your kindness, for sending me, has sent you a hundred Guinies


I, was she so obliging? Where be they?


At my Chamber.


O the Subtilty of these men! for fear I should not keep my assignation, yon
think to oblige me that way, to come to you; but you may believe, my dear
Bellamy, I am all yours, and will be so when e're you name the time


On my Conscience, my wife's not come home yet: Well, thus it must be, in
spite of chance, and high heel Shoes which will go a wry sometimes. How a Lady
there, -- and my Wife not with her? -- hah, -- my Wife? Stay, are my Eyes mine
own? -- it is she -- my friend Wife, in that the other end of the Town habit she
has so long wished for: but, Mr. Bellamy, and she are whispering, I must not yet
advance


This night let it be. --


You have had enough of your Lady, sure for one day?


Doubt me not, dearest, Madam?


So, Madam, is it come to that? would they had done, that I might approach
without interruption


And with all faith and secrecy, I am undone else: for you know my vows to my
Lord


You undo me with these suspicions.


See my Husband. -- Pray, Sir, present my service, and humble thanks, to my
Lord, and my Husbands too. --


Yes, I beseech you, Sir. --


I will obey you, Madam. --


-- Still, I say, this is an Assenego, he will never stand a Complement with
me: But, Sapientia mea mihi; -- but, what new Graces has his Lordship done us,
that you have made me send him thanks for? For you say, you bought these rich
Cloths your self


It Is enough, I am sensible, and you may leave your silly impertinent
inquisitions


I stand corrected, Friend.


And stand still corrected, or I shall break the Peace with you.


Never the sooner for a hasty word.


Before I married you, did not my Lord make you Indent with me, to ask me no
Questions, to deny me nothing I had a mind too, either for wearing, or eating,
or going abroad where and with whom I pleased; and did you not agree to all
this


I did, and will still hold to my Indentures with my Noble Lord: whose favor I
would not loose, for Forty Indentures


O would you not so.


And what the dickins care I for my spightful Neighbors, who because they
cannot maintain their Wives so fine as thou art, asperse thee, -- and cry
there is Tom. Salewares fine Wife: but Sapientia mea mihi, is my Motto; Let the
Assenegoes tattle their hearts out, for I am resolved to show my self a dutiful
Husband, in spite of Fortune and foul weather


To prevent their talking, I Will remove out of their sight, and leave your
pitiful Shop keeping


Never the sooner for a hasty word.


Nay, I Will do it. I have been about it: have all under one done other Business
too


I could tell her under who, if I durst too.


What Is that you mumble there, to your self?


I was only Divining what that business should be, which you did all under one;
I Will warrant, you have taken fine Lodgings in the Mall, as you intended


No, but I have taken a house there, by my Lords directions.


How, how, what must I then break up Shop?


No indeed, look to your Shop, and keep your City house too, for your self to
lie in


Must I not then lie in the same house?


No, Friend, not unless you mean to break with me for ever.


Well, -- I will not disoblige thee, nor my Noble Lord, for any Consideration,
for you know my Motto; Sapientia mea mihi; Stultitia tua tibi. -- And so let us
in to Dinner.


MAdam, I Am but a bashful Lover, unskilled to court a Widow, to swear I love
you, -- must and will have you; -- And want the moving confidence to stir your
blood by putting you to it, before the Priest declare it lawful; -- But, I have
Love and tenderness, which you will find in all the Actions of my life


This modest Courtship will do no good on the Widow, he has mistook her humor.
Blessed mistake!


My Lord, I am not worthy your regard, my Birth, and Education, are not suitable
to your great Fame. Fortune, it is true, was kind and gave me wealth, which sets
me up a Mark for every Man, that aims at riches: Whilst all my little Beauties
lie dead upon my hands, none court for that in a Wife; It Is enough, his Mistress
shall be fair


Madam, you seem to upbraid me with a sin, I vow, I never knew, -- I am so
Innocent. --


That 'twere pity Marriage should de bauc h yor Lordship.


It cannot, Madam, I Will be so true to you, -- so faithful, and so just --


Impossible! I would not have you so degenerate from the true gallantry of your
Sex, and Age, to be a constant Husband. O how vile a sound it has! a young
Lord, and constant to his Wife! Not for the World, would I be that Woman, that
should be guilty of making you so strange a Monster


Madam, by my Honor, I never loved till now, and you may rally as you please;
but, I again protest it is not your wealth, but Virtue I admire: and you I must
possess, or be for ever wretched


-- Stay, -- let us retire again, here is the Lord Loveless.


Let there be the Devil, I Will not retire an Inch, -- -- Save you, Widow. --


What rudeness is this?


Widow, I am in have, and have not leisure for long whining Courtship.


Mr. Saveall, what Fellow's this, you have brought to affront me?


Your Pardon, good my Lord, we knew not of your Lordships being here; it is Mr.
Careless, Nephew to Sir Oliver Thrivewell, -- of whom I have procured the Five
hundred pound, your Lordship desired by Mr. Bellamy


For that I thank you; but for him, I must have an account of his rudeness.


Pray have respect to the presence of the Widow, my good Lord. --


I shall do as becomes me, Sir.


Then it seems, you do not deny the Letter, to be your own hand?


No, faith, Widow.


Have you the impudence to confess it?


Yes, and will not ask your Pardon for it; why what the Devil was there, that
was not kind? I offered, if you Married, to do your Drudgery, 'Egad I think
you're beholden to me


Madam, I made my first Addresses to you, and desire the favor of being first
heard


Sir, she shall hear me first, whoere came first I care not, she has heard you
first already; or you have lost time


Sir, I have been heard, and I will be heard again, and what is all this to you?


But you shall not, Sir; let me see you dare speak a Syllable to this Widow; or
but tell her you love her with your Eyes, and it shall be your last; by Heaven
it shall


Unhand me, Saveall. --


How dare you, Sir, use this insolence in my house? On what encouragement, or
by what Authority is it


Good pert thing, hold thy prating, for let me tell thee, I neither love thee,
my self, as you perhaps vainly imagine, nor will I suffer any other to do so


I beseech your Lordship, to Pardon him, he is certainly mad.


The fitter for you, Widow.


Madam, the respect I bear you ties my hands, or you should see I would not be
affronted. -- Mr. Careless, you know me I suppose, and pray expect me to morrow
morning


I shall, Sir, I shall. You have your answer, Sir, and may be gone.


Death, shall my fears of angring her, make me endure all this?


Sir, what is your business here? what have you to say to me? If any thing, say
it quickly, and leave me free


Softly, good Widow, you are so impatient, till you hear me say, I love you, --
well, know then I do love you most abominably, and am resolved to Marry you,
and then to use you as I list


Pray, Sir, how old are you?


O parlous Wit! what, I warrant you expect to be Courted in fine Language; --
Ah, cruel Woman, how can you treat a Gentleman that loves you dearer than his
Eyes, so rigorously? One that cannot, -- nay, will not, (whilst there are ways
to dye,) live out of your favor.


Who is it, you speak of, Sir? --


I am the wretched Man. --


All this, and more, Sir, my heart directs to an unknown youth, who loves not
me.


Death, but you shall not, I Will have you love none but me.


I cannot choose, you're such a civil Person, and write such passionate stuff in
your Letter. --


O does that Letter trouble you? In good time, I Will write more, and worse to you
hereafter, and in earnest too. -- Did I not tell you the mistake, unreasonable
Creature


Sir, I have nothing to say to you; and beg your Pardon, if I tell you, I
desire you no more to visit me


Why, then fare you well. I Will have as good a Widow, on every Alehouse Chimney.


O how his humor pleases me, yet now I Will be revenged on it. -- Sir, your
Servant, will your Lordship please to walk in? This rude Fellow has disordered
you


Madam, you honor your servant, and fully make amens, for all I Have suffered,
in the Allowance of this favor


But, Sir, I am not pleased she should allow it you.


Death, Sir, But she shall. --


Shall you control me, in my own house? -- Pray learn to know your self. -- Mr.
Saveall, pray carry him away; or I Will have it done more indescently.


I will endure it for once; because I know 'twas done only in revenge to me. --
But who is here? My fine young dandy-prat, -- and at the Widows too! -- Sir, I
have seen you but twice, and 'twas at places where I cannot allow of your
coming, first at my Aunts, and now, here at my Widows.


Your Widow, good Sir? I thought she had been the Widow of one deceased?


Thou art a pretty witty child; but, Sirrah, let me find you here no more, nor
at my Aunts, I charge you: if I do, I shall have you whip't


I hear your Charge, Sir; but you must leave it to my discretion, whether I
will obey you, or not


Well, Sir, remember I have given you fair warning.


Sir, will it please you to walk homeward?


You must excuse me, Sir, at present.


It will not be convenient, Sir, to visit the Widow again to day.


O fear it not, Sir, I do not like her so well now.


Do your pleasure, Sir, -- Farewell.


This damned Widow sticks in my Stomach, I am resolved she shall not have me
now, unless she court me to it, to which end, I will go drink her out of my
head, for to my heart she is not yet arrived; and then I Will home, and do that
which only my Aunt and I must be acquainted with: this is her Night of grace,
she has promised me to be kind; if she keep touch with me, -- O how I shall
love. --


So, they are gone. -- And now must I prepare to meet Mrs. Saleware, I have a
mind to try her honesty, which I believe is as little, as her faith to my Lord:
I have appointed her to meet me at a certain convenient house, where I have got
a Bed ready; but how to supply her with a bedfellow suitable to her humor, I
cannot tell: I have therefore writ this, in an unknown name, to her Husband,
who shall come and prevent the Plot, and save my credit; -- but if he fail? --
would that were my greatest grief; but here I leave the man my soul adores,
courting another, may she be deaf to all his Love, as I was to my reason, when
it pleaded against his false addresses. --


In troth, I pity you, but you were to blame too, Phebe, I must needs say, to
yield


'Twas the effects of Love, Madam, and his solicitations.


Well, well, I Will see what I can do for you, though it be but for the pleasure of
revenge for attempting me: -- Closet, you know my mind, -- and how to order our
design


Doubt me not, Madam.


I hope he will get himself fudled to night, to further it.


Then he may forget your Ladyships promise.


No, no, then he will be the more earnest.


You know his humor best that way, it seems, -- but away, here comes Sir
Oliver. --


Make love to my wife? a fine young Rogue! -- Well, Watt, for this discovery,
I Will reward thee bountifully. -- Sweetheart, I have a suit to you


Pray what is it? you may command me.


It Is for my absence from thee, to accompany a friend to Dover, who is going
for Holland


I hope this is no excuse to go again to your Citizen's wife.


Think no more of that, Sweetheart, but expect me to morrow at dinner; if I be
not here before, and catch you napping, my free Lady.


His absence falls out luckily,


Your Nephew is come, Madam, and very much uppish (as they say) but not so far
gone as to forget your Ladyships Promise, and he is gone to bed, in expectation
of your coming


And have you dressed his Mistress up, as I directed?


Oh, most famously, Madam.


But have you charged her to steal from him, before it is light?


Yes, I have, Madam.


Why Lord, Mr. Bellamy, you are the strangest man in the World, to think I am
jealous, because I ask for my Aly. I am an Asenego, if I be. --.But yet I know
she is here


Why look you now, is not this jealousy, not to believe me?


Oh, you equivocate, Mr. Bellamy, I protest you do; she is not indeed here at
the door, but I Will warrant you she is above, but what is that to me? -- Alas, Sir,
it cannot make me jealous. -- I hope I shall see her safe at home, some time or
other, at her own leisure. -- But it is a hard case tho


Now are you relapsing into your jealousy again?


What an Asenego's this? there is no man in the City more confident of his wife,
than I am of my Aly: nor will I be dashed or basht at any scandalous reports
that go of her, therefore tell me, whether she is here or no, for I don't come
to disturb her


There, you are jealous again. -- But to end all disputes, Sir, your wife is
here, and I believe going to bed by this time


Why what a notable merry Scab are you, Mr. Bellamy? -- Away, away, I faith
you're a Wag now


What, you will not believe me now?


Believe you? why no, by my troth, not I.


What made you fancy she was here?


I fancy, Sir, I have as few fancies as any man breathing, -- but I received a
Note from one Mr. Spywell, hinting that my Aly was to lie with a certain Friend
here all night. -- A very pleasant business; as if I believed it: -- not I,
Sir, I protest, for she has no friend but my Lord, and as if he would bring her
to such a place as this, he having such Lodgings of his own, and she a House --
is a ridiculous business. --


Why did you come then?


To see the meaning of this Spywell's Letter, who bid me come and inquire for
you


Well, and here I am.


Well, and what of that? he is an Asenego that inquires further: and so farewell
to you


Stay, Sir, I was that Spywell that writ to you, for I knowing you had not lain
with your wife this three months, out of pure kindness, laid this Plot, that
you might come and lie with her here


Why, and is she here indeed?


Come along with me, and be convinced.


This is a Plot laid by my wife to oblige me: I am sure it is so. Ah little
Rogue, how I will pay thy kindness!


If you say I sent for you, you will spoil all, but you must say you came by
inspiration, or that you were informed in a dream, or a vision, or so forth


I warrant you, Mr. Bellamy, for Acting my part well. My wife has laid this
Plot to give me a sure proof of her honesty. --


Credulous fool! -- well stand you behind this door, and I Will go in and speak to
her


Ay, ay, Sir, I Will warrant you, I Will stand close.


Ah, Mr. Bellamy, are you come? you are a fine man, to make me languish thus
long without you, are you not? -- Come, have to undress you, and let us to bed


So, very good, ha, ha, ha. --


What does your Passion that was to day so high, decay already?


That Is pleasant again, as if I were such a fool, to think such an Asenego as
he had ever had a Passion for her, -- ha, ha, ha. --


Did you only court me to a consent to despise me for it afterward?


As if she had ever consented to lie with my Lord's man; a pretty business,
that.


Or you perhaps, malicious as you are, courted me only to try me, and then
betray me. -- Will you not answer me


Oh Madam, I am so surprised with an accident that you little dream of, that I
am not able to utter a word


Was there ever such witty waggish Rogues seen as these two? what a pretty Plot
have they laid to make me jealous


Speak again, what is it has happened?


Death, I could find in my heart to kill the cuckoldly Idiot, the horned beast,
for preventing my dear expectations thus. --


As I am a Christian, this is very pretty sport, ha, ha, ha.


What Is the matter? what Cuckold, my husband? --


Ay, ay, I know not by what damned Witchcraft, but he knows we are here; the
Devil assisted him sure to find us


Oh, I am ruined then: he will tell all to my Lord.


Never the sooner for a hasty word. -- I should ruin my self then too: no, no,
sapientia mea mihi, is my Motto; be not dashed or basht for that, good Friend.


Has, my husband's here indeed.


As sure as you are there, sweet Ali. What, you thought to make me jealous now?
but I thank my reason, I have more grace than so: no, I know what is what, as my
Friend Hudibras has it. Make me jealous! honest Tom? -- no, Mr. Bellamy, I am
beholden to you. -- But how I came hither, you shall never know, nor, do you
hear me talk of any Letter or Porter that came to give me intelligence, no, nor
name, Mr. Spywell, not I, sapientia, is my Motto


Death! the fool will out with all.


What means all this?


I mean? I know what you mean; come, come, never blush for the matter, you
might have told me you had a mind to. --


To what, Coxcomb?


Ha, ha, ha, I, I, never put on this feigned anger, the Plot is discovered, and
I am not jealous


What Plot?


That you had a mind to do me the honor of letting me lie with you to night,
and now it is out. -- Mr. Bellamy, I hope we shall have your company, tho not in
the same bed, and E'faith, we will have a Sack-Posset before we go to bed, sweet
Ali


What a defeat is here! --

Mr. Bellamy, hark ye. -- Thomas, be at a distance.


Face about, Tom.


You have betrayed me every way: I see it plain, and will be revenged on you,
if I live


Who, I by all. --


No swearing, you are a young Hypocrite: where is the hundred Guineys you had
for me, -- you said


And have; -- but shall I give them you before your husband?


Come, come, I see I am abused and fooled; who was it sent for him, has? --
not you, I Will warrant


Not I, I vow by your fair dear self, and am so mad, that he has defeated me,
that if you will give me leave, I Will kill him, to enjoy thee. --


No, hold; if this be true, I Am reconciled again, and pray let us meet again to
morrow


May all that is man about me forsake me, if I lose any opportunity: and so I Will
take my leave. --


Nay, E'faith we will have a Sack-Posset, as I said, before we go to bed. --


Well, tho I seem to believe him, I am resolved he has done me this injury.

And when a willing woman is so crossed,
All thoughts, but of revenge, are lost.

Tell me, Ali. indeed, how you came hither.


You will not be angry then?


I am an Asenego, if I be.


It was indeed to make thee jealous.


Now hang me, if I did not imagine so: nay, nay, I can prophecy right sometimes.


And how do you think you were brought hither?


Nay, I can prophecy that too: Mr. Spywell's Letter -- but I Will say no more.


Ha, ha, ha, let us see the Letter.


Hah, -- where is it? -- hum, -- have I lost it? -- and sacks so I have. --


Well, well, 'twas I that sent it, Simpleton. --


Why did thou indeed, and indeed? -- Well, let us to bed, for I am now so in
love with thy pretty Project, that I fancy strange things: Come, let us to bed,
we will get a Sibyl or a small Prophet this night.


Oh stay, my dear Aunt, stay, it is not near day yet, we have many minutes of
joy to come ere that approach. -- She Is gone, -- I heard her Chamber door open,
-- would I could find it, -- my Uncle's not at home, and I Will go to her there.
-- Who Is this? one with lights


Is the Devil in you, that you make such a noise at this hour.


Would it not make a man distracted to be so soon left by so sweet, so dear a
Creature? -- Come let us retire again. --


Sure you are mad to desire it, 'twill ruin us both.


I Will warrant you: my charming obliging Aunt! --


Oh Madam, don't you hear some body knock at the door? on my conscience it is
Sir Oliver, by the authority of clamor he makes there


I hope not.


E'gad and so do I, I hope it is that Rogue Watt, having forgot I have turned
him away, and is drunk. Come, -- let us retire again, can we be sensible of any
thing but joy


Hark ye, Closet, -- go. --


It shall be so.


That was kind, and well thought on, to give her instructions what to do.


You cannot guess at what I said.


Why, to tell my Uncle, that -- you are not well, -- and desire him to lie by
himself to night, or --


Thou art so lewd a fellow, thou can not think one sober thought of me, which
makes me now repent the favors I have done thee: be gone, and see my face no
more. --


How unreasonable is a woman when her own turn's served! -- Hark ye, dear Aunt.
--


Approach me not; if thou do, I Will raise the house.


Unmerciful creature! do not provoke my love, which is so high, it is arrived
almost to rage, do not; you know not what 'twill make me do, for now you are in
my power, have a care, -- I say, have a care. --


Dare you do so base a thing, as to proclaim my shameful kindness? perjured man!


Why do you provoke me then, do you think to kindle a fire in my heart, and let
it burn out alone? No, I am resolved it shall be laid. -- Come, come, by all
that is good, dear Aunt, I love you; and love you ten times more since you were
kind, then before, and I think the Devil's in you if you desire a man should do
more


I am undone.


Alas, that ever you were kind. -- How prettily this penitence becomes you.
Come, now a tear or two, and then -- thou will be fit to be undone again


Oh Monster, Villain, Rascal, what do thou merit for this baseness, but death
immediately from my hand? -- And thou false woman, that have thus betrayed me.
--


What Devil sent him hither?


Pray hear me, Sir.


Can I hear more to convince me thou art false, or I unhappy, -- then what I Have
heard already


I was not so unreasonable when Mrs. Saleware and you were kind.


And did you, perfidious woman, pardon me that, to be revenged on me this way.


Mistake me not, nor wrong me: I have only showed you what some would have
done. -- Sir, 'twas my design, to let you see this extravagance of your Nephew


O witty, dear Devil, how I love thee for thy rare quality -- of dissembling.


Oh, she is the falsest woman. --


Mr. Saveall, you have ever been most obliging, pray persuade Sir Oliver to
retire into my Chamber, and hear with patience what I have to say to him, he
shall find there the cause of this mistake


I Will do my best to serve you, Madam.


And do thou think ever to reconcile me? --


'Twill not be the part of a judicious man to condemn before the cause be
heard, good Sir Oliver, as I take it, let me entreat that justice from you


Well, Madam, I will hear you, tho no false tale thou can devise, shall
persuade me against my senses. But, Sirrah, for your part -- get you out of my
doors, I Will see thee starve and beg, for an ungrateful reprobate, as thou art.
--


Indeed you must not put him out of doors.


How! dare you take his part?


Yes, I dare and will justify it, nor shall you give him a word or look, that
declares anger, you shall not, Sir, 'till you have heard me, and then take your
course


Kind soul! I could kiss her all over for this.


You're very confident, but I Will forbear, till I Have heard you, tho thou can
say nothing to make me think you are innocent


Go, -- go to bed again, George, and sleep, without fear of any thing, all
shall be well again.


Sweet dear charming gilt, how I love thee! now will she manage my Uncle so,
that it is ten to one but I shall be rewarded for my nights work to morrow: but
Lord, how she thought to terrify me, with chiding me, and repenting her
kindness to me. Now -- go to bed, George, ha, ha, ha. --

Well go thy ways; I know thy Plots will hit:
There Is nothing like a woman's sudden wit.

TO speak with me?


Yes, my Lord.


Bring em in.


Pray, Thomas, attend at a distance.


Face about, Tom. Saleware, -- and March forwards; that I learnt at Finsbury
Muster.


How now, in tears, why is that lovely face where all my souls delight dwells,
thus strangly dressed in sorrow


Alas, my dear Lord. --


Who is t dares injure thee? I know thy Husband is better manner'd, than to
offend thee; and any other cannot escape with life. -- Come name the cause


There is a man has Injured me; but one below you, my dear Lord, to take notice
of, your servant Bellamy may do it. Do you believe him honest, my dear Lord


Most perfectly so, if I have any judgment.


I know, my dear Lord, you ever esteemed him so: but, -- if your Lordship had a
Jewel, or any other thing, you valued and would reserve for your own wearing,
would you let him enjoy it too


I know not any thing I should refuse him the use of: except, thy dear self,
where I can brook no Rivals


Yet he, my Lord, has wickedly attempted me, and in that has wronged your
Honor, and your trust


You surp^ize me!


My Lord, 'is truth.


It cannot be. I know he durst not do it.


Must I not then find credit?


Give me some circumstances, but to prove it.


Tho if I had said it only, 'twere sufficient: yet you shall have
circumstances. Thomas, -- come hither Thomas. Pray tell his Lordship, what you
heard and saw, last night between Mr. Bellamy, and I


Why may't please your Lordship, my Ali. was abroad all the afternoon
yesterday, as she often is, may't please your Lordship, and may as often be
again, an't please your Lordship


It Is well, -- forward.


Well, out she was, an't please your Lordship, it grew late, and no Ali. came,
it grew later and no Ali. came yet, so that Ie'en concluded she would stay all
night, an't please your Lordship, as she has done many a night, an't please
your Lordship


Prithee proceed.


I shall, an't please your Lordship. It being late, an't like your Lordship, as
I said before, an't please your Lordship, I had word brought me, an't please
your Lordship, that my Ali. was to lie with a Friend, an't please your
Lordship, at a certain house in Drury Lane, an't please your Lordship; well, I
went, and because I hate to be tedious, or hold your Lordship in a long tale, I
will only say, an't please your Lordship, I went thither, as I said, and found
my Ali. just undrest for Bed, Mr. Bellamy, ready to go into Bed to her


It cannot be!


Be? why I Will justify it, an't please your Lordship.


Then your Wife's guilty too; how came she thither?


I hope you will not think so ill of me, my dear Lord, alas, I was betrayed,
the cunning Villain told me your Lordship was to be there, and desired my
company; when I came and found you not, he bid me undress me, and get me to
bed, and you, my dear Lord, would come to me. At last I finding 'twas but a
Cheat, and not knowing how to get away, writ a Note to my Husband, to come and
relieve me


Is It possible a man that weeps, and blushes, should be such an one?


I vow to Gad, an't please your Lordship, I fancied all the while they had but
played the wag, to make me jealous; and Ali. (ah, the little cunning Gypsy)
knowing I was peeping at the door. Cried come to bed, Mr. Bellamy, make have
and undress you, Mr. Bellamy


Peace, Fool, -- he will spoil all. --


Mum. --


I do not like this. Where Is the Letter?


Here, an't please your Lordship. --


The Devil take you for giving him the Letter. You said you had lost it.


I thought so Friend; but I found it since.


Thou Would better have swallowed it full of Opium.


I would I had so too, for me, rather than have offended thee.


Mr. Saleware, If you would not be a worse Cuckold than you are, come away to
the Joyners in Drury Lane, it being a convenient Bawdy House, and you will find
your Wife there, ready to add to your Horns

Yours, Spywell.

-- What means this? it is Bellamy's own hand.


How shall I come off now? -- Why does not your Lordship see how excellent I am
at counterfeiting hands? I feigned Mr. Bellamy's Character, a purpose: It Is not
well


This Woman's, false, I see it. -- Who waits?

-- Where Is Bellamy.


He has not been at home to night, my Lord.


I hope your Lordship will believe me now; but I was told he paid his visit to
my Lady Thrivewell, this morning


He is to receive money there for me, pray Heaven he be true, I scarce dare
trust him. Tho I cannot believe what this false Woman says. Get my Coach ready,
I Will go to Sir Olivers, my self


I can tell you another circumstance of his dishonesty too.


What is it?


He loves, and is beloved, (I mean dishonestly) by my Lady Thrivewell; and this
he told me himself boastingly, that I might yield the sooner


Dare you justify this?


Yes indeed, dare I to their faces.


And so you shall. -- Mr. Saveall, your servant.


Mr. Bellamy, my Lord, is telling out the hundred pound at Sir Olivers, for
you; but my Lord, there is a little difference in Sir Olivers Family, that my
Lady desires your Lordship to compose, if possible


With all my heart. My Coach: -- You must along, Mrs. Saleware.


No, Villain, I Will have no more to do with thee. I Will leave thee to thy own shame
and poverty


It may be so.


All that is thine, I Will turn out after thee; your Phebe, too, your virtuous
Mistress, take her, and be gone


I thank you for nothing, this was a moveable that belonged to me, before your
virtuous Wife laid us together. -- Who the Devil would have imagined, she
should have Gilted me so? a young hansome proper fellow as I am to


Sirrah, sirrah, have a care what you say of my Wife for I shall lay you fast
enough else


Is this -- your witness, Sir; this precious villain?


No villain neither, Sir, since I have not betrayed my Master, for you turned
me off basely


Here Is another of your Engines, this old Deceptio visus, that put me to Bed to
the wrong Woman


Alas, good Gentleman, -- ha, ha, ha.


But if, Mr. Bellamy, had been the Man, I suppose, Madam, you would have kept
your word; and old Mother Damnable, would have brought the right party


What means he?


Fie, George, you will be ashamed of this anon?


Faith, I shall not, and since you have betrayed me, I Will ruin you; therefore
hear me, Oh thou credulous Knight, what I Have to say unto thee. --


What can thou say, good George, to my prejudice? Hold yet, whilst thy credit
may be saved


Not I, it shall out, unless you bribe me.


Not a farthing, -- and see who will have the worst on it.


What would the Villian say to thy dishonor?


That, which if you are no contented Cuckold, will make you mad, Sir, it will:
-- you think I have done so lewd a thing in courting her, -- but there is that
smooth-faced young fellow, Bellamy, has courted her, and all the rest -- I can
assure you


Mr. Bellamy! it cannot be.


But it can, Sir; there is her procurer, old dark Lanthorn can tell you more.


Who I? oh Lord!


Oh, she was chamber'd up with him at least two hours, fair time, -- under
pretense of borrowing money; but you may guess his farther business, if you
have any sense


I Will not believe this, Sir; it is malice.


It Is fit you should see it done, indeed, and great pity you did not.


Oh, Mr. Saveall, if this be true, where is all my Reputation? --


And for that Rascal, Watt, there, I Will give you an account of him, which yet
you never had: have you forgot, how we rescued you on Hounslow-heath, when you
believed your self set on by Thieves


No, I have not forgot it; would I had lost my Money nay a Limb, rather than
have been by thee preserved. --


That project, Sir, was his, to get me into your favor gain; the Robbers, as
you thought 'em, were his acquaintance, Rogues of his managing, but to say
truth, we meant no hurt, only I was forced, to color the business, to give him
a cut over the Pate, would 't had killed him


Was It his Plot? I am glad to find him a fellow of that ingenuity: I love him
for it


Do you? then pray take notice, 'twas my own Plot, mine, Sir, to get my self
into your favor


Truly, Sir, my Master's in the right, 'twas his Plot.


'Twas witty whose soever 'twas, and I like it well, would all the rest of the
Actions of your life were as well


Well, Sir, now you know my mind, and I Will take my leave; farewell, Nuncle. Come
away, Phebe, I have been an unkind Dog to thee, that is truth: but come, I Will
even make thee amends, and marry thee, and having no better way to live, even
fell Coffee with thee. -- Come away. --


Pray call him back; to let him go in this condition will undo him, and I
desire to be cleared too, before he goes of, the aspersion he has laid on me


Yes, Sir, you shall stay, and answer it before Authority.


Why, Sir, if you have a mind to have your house thought a Bawdy house, I can
stay, and prove it


Mrs. Crostil is come to wait on your Ladyship.


This is a great favor, Madam. Sir Oliver, pray entertain Mrs. Crostil a
little. --


Methinks you all look disordered, I hope, Sir Oliver, you and your Nephew have
a good understanding


No, Madam, nor do I desire to have any with such a Villain.


How, Sir? nay, if you rail at him 'twill make me love him.


Then you are wretched.


Nay, then I Am resolved to love him -- Pray what is she he makes such love to?


A common wench, that is with child by him; she pleads a Contract with him, and
he will marry her


Still you raise my flame to a greater height. -- Mr. Careless, pray let me
speak with you


Who mean you, Madam, -- me? I Am not at leisure now?


What the Duce was I made of, that his contempt of me increases my fire. Sir, I
must needs speak with you


What have you to say? Widow, you are come too late, Widow.


Pray walk a little this way. -- I must speak to you alone.


Pray keep your self concealed, my Lord will be Oliver, and the Forfeiture's
out, and he shall be just to you, or we will undo him. -- Sir Oliver, pray
whatever reason you have to be displeased with your Nephew your self, do not
ruin his fortune with the widow. --


Tempt me not, widow, to your own ruin, if I should be so unlucky as to marry
you, you are certainly undone, for I am one you cannot live with above a
fortnight, you are fine limbed and delicate, and I shall spoil you. -- Here Is
one that knows my strength, and will hold me tack. --


I know not what you mean.


Nor prithee never try, -- I advise you in time, widow, this wench here is only
fit for me


Is my profer'd passion scorned? --


Faith no, widow, but I shall never merit you: -- besides, I am engaged, widow.


To that woman? --


Yes, to that woman; what exceptions have you to her?


Why she is a wench, a common prostitute.


Hark ye, have a care what you say (I advise you) before witness, do not abuse
a woman I design to make a wife of, lest I hamper your Estate, widow


She shall not be your wife, no woman but I shall marry you.


Have a care what you say before witness again, widow.


Call all to hear me, Sir Oliver, and the rest be witness I give my self to
this Gentleman. --


Here Is one forbids the Banes, widow.


You shall compound with her.


But what said King Harry? Conscience, -- conscience, widow.


No matter, Sir, give me your hand, beer witness all, I plight my Faith to this
Gentleman


Then you are ruined.


Sir, it is too late to advise, I am resolved.


Have I caught you, widow, -- hah, ha. -- Farewell, Nuncle. -- And yet --
Conscience pulls me back. -- Besides, widow, the woman is not satisfied


I Will give her three hundred pound.


The woman is not such a fool to take it.


But the woman shall be so wise to take it, for what ever you all think, I do
not love my Master so ill, to spoil his Fortune. And, Sir, truth is, I have
received -- some favors, -- as they say, from Mrs. Phebe, as well as you, that
is, she has been kind, Sir


I thought so.


And I Am content to marry and make her honest, if she can get any addition to
this Lady's bounty, to make her any fortune


That was well said, Watt, and I Will promise the other hundred, in lieu of that I
had in Wares of her Kinswoman, with your permission, Sir Oliver


With all my heart.


Watt, go for the Parson then, we will have 'em married presently.


Madam, in obedience to your commands, I am come to wait on you.


You have honored me, my Lord, tho our difference is almost at an end, yet I
have something to deliver to your Lordship in private


Madam, I have also a question to ask you in private too.


I shall be glad of any occasion to serve your Lordship.


Madam, will you withdraw a little? only this Gentlewoman may be witness of
what I have to ask you


I fancy what it is already, and must entreat your Lordship to speak it out,
what e're it be


'T would not be for your Honor, Madam.


I am not of your opinion, my Lord, and that I may let you see I am not, I Will
speak it for you: You come to ask me, and this woman to accuse me with
dishonorable Love to a servant of yours, Bellamy I mean, is it not so


Madam, it is.


This pleases me, indeed she has revenged her self handsomely; I have a Kinsman
here of that opinion


But, Madam, I recant, 'twas in the days of my debauch and brutality, I am
reformed now by your virtues only, -- and humbly beg your pardon


Madam, is not Bellamy, here?


He will be presently, my Lord, but now your Lordship, has questioned me, I
hope I may have the same freedom with you


Madam, you may command me any thing.


Pray where is my Sister Clara?


Is that a question for me to answer, Madam?


Yes, and which in Honor you are bound to answer: Did you not betray her to
shame and infamy, and robbed her of her Virgin purity


I did not ravish her, Madam.


I do not say you did. But you had Flattery which did much more than force; I
ask not her Honor back, but her life, and self, for we have never heard of her
since that fatal Treachery of yours, and it is of you that I demand her


You, cannot sure comple me to return her, if I could?


But she shall, Sir, and I will be her Champion.


Her loss, Madam, is a greater Grief to me, than it is to you; -- but for you,
Sir, I shall find a time to try your prowess


But you shall not, Sir, I Will end the controversy.


I am amazed, -- Clara, -- and my Bellamy's the same.


Yes, your Bellamy, is the wronged Clara. -- Do you not blush to see me? -- I Am
come to claim your vows, so often sworn, and so long broken. --


So, I was like to have made fine work.


Bless me! Bellamy, a Woman?


Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope.


Sir, the Parson's come.


Come, Widow, dare you sign, seal, and deliver?


With all my heart, Sir.


Being by you undone, and made unfit to look abroad with Honor, and more unfit
to live, but in the presence of you whom I adored; I did assume that Masculine
habit, to let you see that I had rather live but by your sight alone, than be
my self in any other part of the world; and by your sight alone, could better
contain my self, than she, the Mistress whom you so admired could, with the dear
possession of you


You melt my soul. -- Pray let me make new vows to you, or well confirm the
old. --


Well, I am absolutely lost and undon in my Lords favor.


Never the sooner for a hasty word. Come, come, I do suspect this is all but a
plot to make me jealous


Would you not be laughed at now, sweet Mrs. Saleware?


No, indeed, Madam; nor shall she be by the proudest she that wears a head; or
if she be, it will not make me jealous: Sapientia mea mihi, is my Motto still


Yet I confess, this young Bellamy, and I have been bed-fellows some years
since. Come be not out of countenance, I will not tell what my Husband did with
you last term


Nor shall you make me jealous, Madam, what'ere they did. Efacks not I, sweet
Ali


Can you forgive what is past, and take a penitent man to your mercy?


My Lord, if you will repair my Sisters honor, Sir Oliver, shall give you in
your Mortgage


It Is all I wish on Earth to do so, Madam.


Then, Sir, I Will restore your writings, and by it make her as good a Fortune as
the Widow, and there is within a Parson shall end the difference


It shall be done, Sir Oliver. -- For you, Mrs. Saleware, go home, look to your
Shop, and please your Husband; for from this day, I Will never see you more


I see all things are transitory, -- and will turn Honest, and Thomas, you
shall have no more fears of jealousy


A Pox of jealousy, I wish that were the worst grievance in the Nation, the
jealousy that troubles my Noddle. No, no; Sapientia, etc. is my Motto


See, they are already Married.


What, my Cousin Phebe Gimcrack, too, -- and 'efack, I Will take a frisk for joy.
Watt get some Music


You shall not need, Sir, I have 'em at hand.


Well, Uncle, I hope we shall now be Friends, and according as I behave my
self, let me have your favor, -- you must all Dine with me to day; and at
night, Widow -- I Will say no more. --


Well, Sir, as I shall see how you behave your self, I shall prove my self a
loving Uncle


I will be your Heir yet, in spite of ill Luck, and all my damned
Debaucheries, which now farewell to. --


See, the Musick's here indeed, we'll lead the Bride a Dance, and then they
shall do as much for us, Clara


Now, Clare, that you and I may happy prove,
The Priest within shall consummate our Love.

TOM. face about, with harmeless Rallery,
Instruct the Salewares of the middle Gallery.
Dear Friends, go home and look unto your Wives,
Bid 'em keep in and mend their gadding lives;
They all have got a trick to see a Lord,
-- Yet never the sooner for a hasty word.
I mean no harm, for there are Wives that do
Keep open Shop, and trade as well as you;
Deal by retail, and are to Husbands aiding,
And oftentimes, have much the better Trading.
When time and place are fit, I Will name you some
Who keep a journy-man, or two at home.
I Will say no more; truth sometimes hatred draws:
-- Yet
I Will not be dashed, nor basht, in a good Cause.
I am a Glass in which you all may view,
What strange good Natured things are most of you.
Tho you will believe no Man i the way of Trade,
Yet what believing Fools, by Wives you're made?
Three years you're married, and have never a Son,
Your Wives make visits, and the job is don,
She smiles to see you Rock and Sing, by, by,
And think it is Yours; ah, -- Stultitia tua tibi.
And of your Wives a Pattern see in Aly,
When Trading's dead, they all will strike a Tally;
Yet my dear Friends, be not at this dejected,
Carry't as I do, fair, and stand Corrected:
Act not a Henrick, or a jealous Diego,
It Is safer much, to be an Assenego.
Then let my Wife go visit Knight, or Lord;
Or they come to her, I do not care one -- hum, --
Sapientia mea mihi, is my word.
