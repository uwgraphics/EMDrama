LOok Nymphs, and Shepherds look,
What sudden blaze of majesty
Is that which we from hence descry
Too divine to be mistook:
This this is she
To whom our vows and wishes bend,
Here our solemn search has end.
Fame that her high worth to raise,
Seemed erst so lavish and profuse,
We may justly now accuse
Of detraction from her praise,
Less then half we find expressed,
Envy bid conceal the rest.
Ma^k what radiant state she spreds,
In circle round her shining throne,
Shooting her beams like silver threads,
This this is she alone,
Sitting like a Gods bright,
In the center of her light.
Might she the wise Latona be,
Or the towred Cybele,
Mother of a hunderd gods;
Juno dare's not give her odds;
Who had thought this clime had held
A deity so unparalleled*
Stay gentle Swains, for though in this disguise,
I see bright honor sparkle through your eyes,
Of famous Ar^ady ye are, and sprung
Of that renowned flood, so often sung,
Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluse,
Stole under Seas to meet his Arethuse;
And ye the breathing Roses of the Wood,
Fair silver-buskind Nymphs as great and good,
I know this quest of yours, and free intent
Was all in honor and devotion meant
To the great Mistres of yon princely shrine,
Whom with low reverence I adore as mine,
And with all helpful service will comply
To further this nights glad solemnity;
And lead ye where ye may more near behold
What shallow-searching Fame has left untold*
Which I full often amidst these shades alone
Have sat to wonder at, and gaze upon:
For know by lot from Jove I am the power
Of this fair Wood, and live in Oak'n bowr*
To nurse the Saplings tall, and curl the grove
With Ringlets quaint, and wanton windings wove.
And all my Plants I save from nightly ill,
Of noisome winds, and blasting vapors chill.
And from the Boughs brush off the evil dew,
And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blew,
Or what the cross dire-looking Planet smites,
Or hurtful Worm with canker d venom bites.
When Eev'ning gray does rise, I fetch my round
Over the mount, and all this hallowed ground*
And early ere the odorous breath of morn
Awakes the slumbring leaves, or tasseld horn
Shakes the high thicket, haste I all about,
Number my ranks, and visit every sprout
With puissant words, and murmurs made to bless,
But else in deep of night when drowsines
Has locked up mortal sense, then listen I
To the celestial Sirens harmony,
That sit upon the nine enfolded Spears,
And sing to those that hold the vital shears,
And turn the Adamantine spindle round,
On which the fate of gods and men is wound.
Such sweet compulsion does in music ly,
To lull the daughters of Necessity,
And keep unsteddy Nature to her law,
And the low world in measured motion draw
After the heavenly tune, which none can hear
Of human mould with gross unpurged ear;
And yet such music worthiest were to blaze
The peerles height of her immortal praise,
Whose luster leads us, and for her most fit,
If my inferior hand or voice could hit
Inimitable sounds, yet as we go,
What ere the skill of lesser gods can show*
I will assay, her worth to celebrate,
And so attend ye toward her glittering state;
Where ye may all that are of noble stemm
Approach, and kiss her sacred vestures hemm*

Over the smooth enameld green
Where no print of step has been,
Follow me as I sing,
And touch the warbled string.
Under the shady roof
Of branching Elm Star-proof.
Follow me,
I will bring you where she fits,
Clad in splendour as befits
Her deity.
Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia has not seen.
NYmphs and Shepherds dance no more
By sandy Ladons Lillied banks.
On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar,
Trip no more in twilight ranks,
Though Erymanth your loss deplore,
A better soil shall give ye thanks.
From the stony Maenalus,
Bring your Flocks, and live with us,
Here ye shall have greater grace,
To serve the Lady of this place.
Though Syrinx your Paus Mistres were,
Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.
Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia has not seen.
