HOW long is it since you saw I pray,
That strange old fashioned thing called a New Play.
Or how long indeed do you think 'twill be,
Before you taste that longed for Novelty?
You may set your hearts at rest for this Age,
Union and Catcaells have quite spoiled the Stage.
Time was the Poets could cock, look bigg, and cry,
Damn these saucy Players, let us all agree,
And starve the Rogues, the Times friends turned be,
And I am turned Poet, there is Farce do you see.
But now to my Geatheration friends,
What quick return, or what concise amends.
Have you my ever honored ever dear,
Renowned, whistling Patrons made appear
To him that is your servant every where?
My Name's Mr. Jevon, I Am known for and near.
But no more words in so much Company,
Satisfaction I must have and quickly;
Or Gad, I Will leave off writing directly.
Let me have a pledge of it now you are here,
Or in your Balls you may forget I fear.
Be favorable to this same piece at hand,
And do you hear friends don't, shall I, shall I stand.
If I in Pocket find you dive for Catcall,
I Will let down Curtain, He tell ye that all.
Catcalls well tuned might do well in Opera's,
They Would serve for Hoboys to fill up a Chorus.
Or in a French Love Song, observe you now,
A Cadmeus Pur Qua, Pur Qua, Meme Vou.
Begar Monsieur it be De pretty Whyne,
Ki La D'ance De Mineway, Oh it be very fine.
Dances you have and various here to Night,
But they are English all, all English quite.
Throughout, English Songs, Farce English too,
That Is French Sense,
All Nonsense without any more ado.
Kickshaws like this serve for a Lenten Dish,
If not for Flesh, pray let it serve for Fish.
And since Penance at this Time's in fashion,
Come three Days for Mortification.

GOOD Husband stay with me to Night and make an end of the Holiday at home.


Peace, peace, and go Spin, for if I want any Thread for my stitching, I will
punish you by virtue of my Sovereign Authority


I warrant you: But you will go to the Alehouse, spend your Money, and get drunk,
and come home like Old Nick, and use one like a Dog


How now Brazen-Face do you speak ill of the Government? I am King in my own
House, and this is Treason against my Majesty


I don't understand your stuff, but prithee don't go to the Alehouse.


Well then, I will not go to the Alehouse, I have made an appointment with Sir
Richard Lovemore's Butler, and am to be Princely drunk in Punch at the Hall
Place; we shall have a Bowl big enough to swim in


O Lord Husband, the new Lady they say will not suffer a Stranger to come into
her House, she grudges a draught of Small Beer, and several of this Town have
come Home with broken Heads from her Ladyships own hands for but smelling
Strong Beer in her House


A Pox on her for a Fanatic Jade, she has almost distracted the good Knight,
but she is abroad feasting with her Relations, and will scarce come home to
night, and we are to have much Drink, a Fiddle and Gambals


But her Fanatic Parson will disturb you.


If he does we will toss the Hypocrite in a Blanket, or kick the sanctified
Coxcomb to a Jelly


O dear Husband let me go with you, we will be as merry as the night's long.


Why how now you bold Bettress, what would you be carried to a company of
Smooth-faced, Eating, Drinking, Lazy Servingmen; Rogues whose nourishment runs
all into Lechery? No, you Jade, I will be no Cuckold


I Am sure they would make me welcome, you promised me I should see the House:
Sir Richard and the Family have not been there since you married and brought me
to Town


Why thou most audacious Strumpet, dare thou Dispute with me? go home and
Spin, or else my Strap will wind about thy Ribs


He that has the best Wife,
She Is the Burden of his Life,
But for her that will Scold and will Quarrel;
Let him cut her short
Of her Meat and her Sport,
And ten times a day hoop her Barrel.

We poor Women must be Slaves and never have any joy, but you men run and
ramble and take your swing


Why you most Pestilent Baggage will you be hoopt? be gone.


Well I must go.


Here now I think of it, here is six pence for you, get Ale and Apples, stretch
and puff thy self up with Lambs Wool, rejoice and revel by thy self, be drunk
and wallow in thy own Stye like a Sow as thou art


He that has a Wife, etc.

I would our blind Minstrel and our dancing Neighbors were here that we may
rejoice a little while, our Termagant Lady is abroad, I have made a most
Sovereign Bowl of Punch, and I have a good hoard of Wine and March Beer


We had need rejoice sometimes, but our devilish new Lady will never suffer it
when she knows it


I will maintain it there is more mirth in a Gally than in our Family, our
Master Sir Richard is the worthiest Gentleman, nothing but Goodness, Sweetness
and Liberality


But here is a House turned topsie turvy, from Heaven to Hell since her coming
hither


We are all alike, none of us can escape her rage and fury.


His former Lady is a Saint in Heaven, and lived so on Earth, all Mildness and
Gentleness


Ay, Rest her Soul, she was, but this is inspired with a Legion of Devils, and
one plaguey Non-Con Parson worse than all, that makes her lay about her like a
Fury


I Am sure I always feel her in my Bones, she has an Instrument of Correction
made of Whale-bone, and for fear I should forget her good usage, she refreshes
my Memory every quarter of an hour: if her Complexion don't please her, or she
look yellow in a morning, I Am sure to be laid on and look black and blue for it


Pox on her, when I carry up her Breakfast I dare not come within reach of her:
I have some six broken Heads already. A Lady quoth a! a Shee-Bear is a civiller
Animal: she has robbed me of my Cunny-Skins, my Kitchin-Stuff, and all my
Vails; and brought a damned eating godly Fellow with her, that scarce will be
content with five Meals a day


None of you have been used as I have.


That Is because none of us had a Spade-Beard of a Foot long.


I that have lived five and forty year in the House, and had for twenty years
preserved a reverent Beard, which made me noted for Wisdom and Discretion
through all the Country, and she to demolish this poor Beard in an instant


I beseech you, by what means did she depopulate and waste your Fruitful Chin?


Why it was ruined by Fire, with her own cursed hands she singed it off; she
said it always smelt of Brewis, and was a Sponge that soaked up more March Beer
in a month than any six the ablest Drunkards in the Hundred could in a year: I
saved nothing but this same one Sprig that grew upon a Wart, and that by my
Nail


What pity 'twas to lose such an emblem of Gravity and Wisdom.


Ay, I am become a shame to my Neighbors and dare not show my Chin before 'em:
Oh that Beard, that poor Beard, what Authority it had amongst 'em! I had e'ne
as live she had gelt me


I believe thou had, thy Beard was of as much use as any Implement about
thee


Methoughts he looked like one of the old Patriarchs, in the Arras I have seen
an old Eastern King, in a Mortlack hanging very much resembling his Phisnomy


Oh Mrs. Jane you do my poor Beard too much honor, but farewell dear Beard, I
shall never see the like of Thee


No, a man may as well hope to have two crops of Oak Timber from the same
place, as two such Beards from one Chin in an Age


Pish, what hurt does the loss of a Beard do? I was making a Shift for her,
and she did not like my Lacing it down; she turns the wrong end of her Fan,
strikes me on the Mouth so hard, that she beat out 2 of my Butter Teeth: A
shame on her light Fingers


She makes the Coachman chain the Footmen to Posts, whip 'em with Dog-whips,
and stands by to see the Execution


Heaven have mercy upon my poor Master, this devilish Termagant Scolding
Religious Woman will be the death of him, I never saw a man so altered all the
days of my Life


There Is a Perpetual motion in that Tongue of hers, and a damned shrill Pipe
enough to break the Drum of a man's Ear, I wonder my Master does not kick her
and her Parson out of doors


Her Parson, her Weaver; I believe he never had any Orders, but an inward
motion from his Stomach, which inclines him to eat more than a Wolf, and this
motion is an inward Call


(within.) Why, Cook John, Cook, where art thou?


I Am here, this is his outward Call; now is he almost famisht for his second
Afternoons Luncheon


Why, John, why do thou neglect me? my Spirits are exhaled, evaporated in
Study and Labor; I feel as it were a strange kind of emptifulness, I have not
eat this two hours


A Pox on him, set him fast by the Teeth or else he will disturb us.


I have a couple of cold Chickens, some Westphalia Bacon, and Christmas Pyes.


For your Christmas Pyes I defy them, they are abominable Scandalous, and
Idolatrous, they savor of Rome, they are so many Fortifications wherein the
Whore of Babylon intrenches her self, I will down with them, I will beat them
down, my zeal will not suffer such Popery in this House; ye are my Flock, I
will see that that Wolf the Whore does not prey upon you and devour you: down,
down I say with all her Outworks and High Places, her Superstitious and
Idolatrous Structures and Buildings, whether in Minced Pyes or otherwise: Your
Christmas is an Idol, a very Idol truly, have I not seen him in a Profane Mask,
in the Habit of an old Man with a long Spade-beard, and the deluded Rout have
worshipped and fallen down before him? your Bagpipes are as Pagan Organs, and
your Wassalers lewd and filthy Choristers unto Satan, I may not bear these Rags
of the Smock of that Scarlet Whore, my Spirit rises, my Zeal boileth and
bubbleth up as it were within me, I am transported with a holy Fury: But do you
hear John Cook send up those Chickens


What both?


Yea both with some Westphalia Bacon, and do you hear, John? a Tart; and you
Mr. Chipp let me have a Bottle of Sack, a Bottle of Ale and a Bottle of March
Beer, by help of this refreshment I shall be able to hold out till Supper. Fare
ye well till that time


What shall we do with this base sniveling Hypocrite? he will spoil our merry
meeting


'Ill warrant you it is but putting out the Candles and we'll make him weary of
his Canting, when e're he comes among us


So his Provision's gone up.


He Is fast by the teeth for one hour.


O welcome, welcome, here is to our wish, the Minstrel and our Neighbor! Oh old
Acquaintance, Goodman Iobson, how do thou


By my troth I am sharp set toward the Punch, and am now come with a firm
Resolution though a Poor Cobbler to be as drunk as a Lord, I am a true English
heart, and look upon Drunkenness as the best part of the Liberty of the Subject


Why did you not bring your Wife with you?


Because here are Waggs, young Rogues, and a Man may be a Cuckold before the
King's Health can go round


Iobson we'll have a Catch, strike up Blind Will: Ah Iobson I have heard thee
outsing the Lark or Nightingal, thou art heard above all the Church, let there
be never so many Voices, thine will still be predominant


Ay and he holds out the Note of one Verse till the Clark begins to sing the
next, he has a pure Wind


Ay I Am pretty good at a Psalm, I have some reason for it, I have stich'd Soles
this thirty years to those Psalms you spoke of


Come, let us fetch out our Bowl of Punch in solemn Procession. Now let us have
a Catch in honor of Punch


While you Court a damned Vintner for such nasty Liquor,
As worse was never swallowed by dull Country Vicar,
And the insolent Rascal will draw what he pleases,
While Boys you may kick 'em when Masters y'intreat 'em,
And from Drawers you up into Aldermen beat 'em;
But they get your Money and you get Diseases.
Stumme Brimstone, Lime, Arsnick, fond Drunkards bewitch,
While the villainous Host not content to be rich,
By Brewing and Poison sells that by false measure,
No Liquor like Punch gives delight to the Soul,
When we drown all our Cares in the bottom' oth' Bowl,
Sincere are our Ioys and immortal our pleasure.
We brew for our selves and we know each ingredient,
As well for our health as our mirth is expedient,
And who ever drinks Punch shall live merry and long,
It spurs up Jade nature and quickens the blood,
Which if it finds bad it never fails to leave good;
And while we drink Punch we shall ever be young.
And after that I Will bring up the Rear with a swinging Turkey-pye, and a mighty
Gammon, besides much Pyes and other Appurtenances belonging to our Office


Here Is our Master's Health in a Bumper. Huzzah.


Our Ladies Confusion in another. Huzzah.


What means this Lewd, Profane, and Babylonish noise, ye Popish Locusts, ye
Idolatrous Vipers, this sanctified Place is become a Denn of Wicked ones. Thou
Blind misleader of the blind, with thy Lewd Antichristian Squeaks, avaunt,
avaunt, I say Beelzebub, avaunt


Hold, hold, what do ye mean?
Ye Sons of Darkness I defy you,
I can suffer for the truth, I am a witness.
Blind him and gagg him.


Bind him hand and foot.


I will flee away from farther Persecution, Vipers my Lady will come, she will
to your Confusion


And as you like this do you come again.


A Pox on him; to our Business now he is gone. The King and all the Royal
Family in a Bumper. Huzzah


Are you ready for your Collation?


No, no, we'll have a bout at Blindmans-buff and a Dance first.


Ay, ay, come I Am old Dog at that, blind me, perhaps I Am as great a Master at
Blindmans-Buff as any one in Europe, no dispraise to any man


O Heaven and Earth! what is here within my House! is Hell broke loose! what
Troops of Friends is here, sirrah you impudent Rascal


My dear be patient it is Christmas, a time of Mirth, of Jollity, it has always
been the Custom of my House to give my Servants Liberty in this Season, and
all my Country Neighbors used to meet, and with their innocent Sports divert
themselves


Prithee hold thy prating, meddle with your own matters, cannot I tell how to
govern my own house without your putting in an Oar? shall I ask you leave to
correct my own Servants


Good Lady, I thought this had been my House, and those my Servants, and those
my Tennants


Did I bring a Fortune to be thus abused, and snub'd before my Servants, do you
call my Authority in Question you inhumane Monster? Look you to your Dogs,
your Kites and filthy Cattle, your Faulconers, Huntsmen, and your nasty Grooms
abroad, I Will make you know it is my Province to govern here, nor will I be
controlled by e're a Hunting, Hauking, unthinking Knight in Christendom


A Pox upon all Fools that shall marry for money, I am married to a continual
Tempest, Strife and Noise, Canting and Hypocrysie are the daily Portion I have
with her; but I Will not bear this long, if I by force oppose her, she falls into
fits, and raves worse than any one Bedlam


You stinking Scoundrels, and you filthy Jades, I Will teach you to Junkit thus
and steal my Provision, I shall be devoured by you


I thought Madam we might be merry once upon a Holyday.


Holyday, you Popish Curr, is one Day more Holy than another? and if it be
you will be drunk upon it, you Rogue, that by your late Demolished Beard, thought
your self an Example to the Family, is this your Example


Come you Minx, you impudent Flurt are you gigging after an abominable Fiddle?
all Dancing is whorish, Huswife

O Murder, murder, she has pulled off both my Ears.


Madam, for shame, remember your Sex and Quality.


Remember your own fools head, shall you instruct me?


Madam, I rejoice that your Ladyship is returned.


Oh good and holy man, how came my Family in my absence thus Debauched,
Drunken, Profane and Superstitious


When my Ears were first offended with these Lewd Noises, I came down grieved
in Spirit, and rebuked them, commanding them to surcease from these
Superstitious and Idolatrous Rites, which they Sacrifice to that Idol, that
beastly Idol, old Father Christmas, and while my Spirit was full of Godly
Chastisement, they did extinguish the Lights, surrounded and hemmed me in, and
these Instruments of Satan did buffet me even unto great anguish, and I am sore
bruised in Body


Alack good man! Oh ye Spawn of Belial the Fry of the bottomless Pit, how now
sirrah, who, are you in the Bumble you Buzzard


I am an honest Psalm-singing Cobbler, Madam; if your Ladyship would go to
Church, you would hear me above 'em all there


I Will try thy Voice now.


Nounz what a Pox, what a Devil ails you?


O Prosane Wretch, wicked Varlet.


Thou Son of the old Serpent, avaunt thou Frog of the Lake of Darkness.


Avaunt thou Coxcombly Son of a Whore of the new Light.


Be gone, Avaunt, Be gone from within these Walls.


What will you wrestle a Fall with me? Come on. Take that Lusty Lug you Rogue
of a Saint, with a pound of Ear of each side


Impudent Villain, has he not hurt the Good man?


He has very much disordered my two Ears, and bruised me exceedingly.


You deserve it for a meddling Coxcomb, go to your Book you ignorant Fop and
road, and rely more upon good Sense, and less upon your new Light


Oh wicked vile wretch, was ever poor Lady so miserable so horridly miserable
in a Brute to her Husband as I am, I that am so Pious, so Good and Religious a
Woman


She is an holy, a sanctified Vessel truly.


He that has the best Wife,
She Is the Burden of, etc.

O Rogue, Scoundrel, Villain.


Remember Modesty.


Are you gone, Sirrah? I Will rout the rest of you: I Will spoil your squeaking
Trebble


O Murder, murder, I am a dark man, which way shall I get hence? Oh Heaven! She
has broken my Fiddle, and undone me, my Wife and Children


Here Poor Fellow come this way, take your Staff, there, there is money to buy
two such Fiddles; go, there is your way


Heaven preserve your Worship, bless you sweet Master, here is a Change indeed,
little did I think to live to find such Doings at this Hall-Place


You are very Liberal, must my Estate maintain you in your Profuseness?


Go up to your Closet, Pray and compose your mind.


Oh wicked Fellow to bid me pray.


A Man cannot be completely cursed without a Wedding, but there is such a thing
as separate maintenance and a Joynter-House, which she to morrow shall try, by
the help of Heaven, I will no longer bear this nuisance in my House. Here, where
are my Servants, what must they be frighted from me? within there, Chipp, come
here and see who knocks there


Within there, where are my Sluts, ye Drabs, ye Queans: Lights there.


Sir it is a Doctor that lives ten mile off with his man, he practices
Physic, and is an Astronomer and a Cunning-man, your Worship knows him, he can
make Almanacks, and help men to their Goods again


Sir I am benighted, it is so dark I cannot see my hand, I cannot possibly reach
home, and therefore knowing the Bounty of your Worships Hospitality, I desire
the favor to be harbored under your Roof this night


Out of my house you lewd Conjurer, you Witch, you Magician.


Avaunt thou Instrument of Satan, I defy thee and all thy Works, thou wicked
Sorcerer avaunt


If you stay in my house, you shall be worse used here, than your Predecessor
Dr. Lamb was in the City


Here Is a turn, here is a change, which if I have any Art she shall smart for.


You see Friend the Case is altered with me, I am not Master of my House, but
e're to morrow this time I Will be Monarch here: go down the Lane friend, and
about half a Quarter of a mile off, you will see a Cobblers house, stay there some
little time, and I Will send my Man that shall conduct you to a Tennants house,
who shall take care of you


Thanks good Sir, I Am your humble Servant, but you Noncon with your surious She
Disciple there, shall have some proofs of my Magic Art this Night


Come Lady you and I must have some Conference.


Yes I will have Conference and Reformation too in this house, or else I Will
turn thee inside outward


My mind misgiveth me, these Varlets have left some good thing in the Bowl
there, but hold, is it not a Wassaling Superstitious Spice-Bowl, let me see,
hah! it is very comfortable and edifieth, there is a huge Island of Tossed, Nutmeg
and Sugar, I will attack it, it is Chearing, I have a Paper with some Parmazan
in my Pocket, which will eat very well with it, this is also a pleasing Liquor,
I will drink plentifully of it and eat Tossed exceedingly: ah my Spirits are
cheared as it were, and are excited unto Joy and Gladness


Oh that sweet toothed Lickerish Hypocrite who is always eating, and looks as
if he had never eaten


His meat does himself no more good than his Doctrine does others, stand close,
you will see him devour that Punch-Tost, he will never be contented without all in
the Bowl


It will disguise him most wickedly, and make him as drunk as one of the
Profane


It does begin to invade my upper Region, my Pericranium does seem to be
somewhat inclined unto Giddiness, hah the Room appears to turn round


He is overtaken.


It Is a very seasonable time, I Am just going to knock to Supper, and my Lady
will not eat without his Grace


Go quickly, he is in a sweet Pickle for a Grace of a quarter of an hour long as
he used to make 'em


Where am I? am I in the Buttery or my own Closet, a most excellent Spice I Will
promise you


Where are you Mr. Noddy? Supper is on the Table, and my Lady stays for your
Grace


Is it Supper time say you, now I think of it I begin to be hungry.


Pray Sir make have my Lady stays for you?


What is the matter with me? I think my Feet are asleep, I cannot use them, my
Eyes are somewhat dim too, which is the way


Ay the Rogue hears my Master intends to turn over a new Leaf, and he has a
mind to wind about, but this shall not serve his turn, he is a Fanatic Rogue still


Pray Sir mend your Draught if you please, you are very welcome Sir.


Thank you heartily good Woman, come I Will give you some requital, I Will tell you
your fortune


Oh! Pray do Sir, I never had my Fortune told me in my Life.


Let me behold the Lines of your Face?


I Am afraid it is none of the cleanest Sir, I have been about dirty work Sir all
this day


Come, it is a good Face be not ashamed of it, you shall show it in greater
Places suddenly


Oh dear, I Sir? I shall be ashamed mightily, I want Dacity when I come before
great Folks


You must be confident I charge you, and fear nothing, there is much happiness
attends you


Oh me, this is a rare man Heaven be thanked.


To morrow before Sun Rise you shall be the happiest Woman in this County.


How, by to morrow? Alack a day, how can this be?


No more shall you be troubled with a Surly Husband, that shall Rail, call you
names and strap you


Lord how came he to know that? he has a Familiar: indeed my Husband is
somewhat rugged, and in his Cupps will beat me but it is not much, He Is an
honest painful Man and I let him have his way, pray Sir take the the other Cup of
Ale


Thank you, to morrow you shall be the richest Woman in the Hundred, and ride
in your own Coach


O Father now you jeer me.


By Heaven I do not, but mark my words, be confident and bear all out, or worse
will follow


Where is this Queen, here Nell, what a Pox are you drunk with your Lambs-wool?


Oh Husband! here is the rarest man, he has told me my Fortune.


Pox on you, and has planted my Fortune too, a Lusty pair of horns upon my
head, has he


Thy Wife's a virtuous Woman, and thou wilt be happy.


Come out ye hang Dogs, ye Juglers, ye cheating Villayns, must I be Cuckolded
by such Rogues as you are, Mackmaticians and Almnack-makers


Prithee peace Husband, we shall be rich, and have a Coach of our own.


A Coach! a Cart, a Wheele-Barrow you Jade, by 'th mackin She Is drunk, bloody
drunk, get you to bed you Strumpet


Oh mercy on us, is this a taste of my good Fortune?


You had better not have touched her you surly Rogue.


Out of my House you Rogues, or I Will run my Nall up to the handle in your
Buttocks


Farewell you Paltry Slave?


Get you out you Rogues?


What? Hoh my Spirits, Nadir and Abishog, hoh!


Here, we are here.


Praesto, all my Charms attend:
'Ere this Night shall have an End,
You shall this Cobler's Wife transform,
And to the Knights the like perform;
This bed the Cobler's Wife I ll charm,
The Knight's into the Cobler's Arm;
Let the Delusion be so strong,
That none shall know the Right from wrong.
The Non-con Parson so affright,
That he may ever Rue this Night;
Scare him from his Little Wits,
And his Hypocritick Fits.

All this, this Night we will perform,
In a Whirlwind, in a Storm.
In Lightning and in Thunder fly,

And muster all the Clouds in the Sky;
Attend me till the Dawn of Day,
And then you may go sport and play.
Hold, here comes Sir Richard's Man: he will guide us to our Lodging, let us meet
him to Horse


Well my dear Friends, though you have found my House in some disorder, I
cannot but rejoice to see you, the sight of Friends will lighten great
afflictions


Some years have past, since we have been merry together.


We have not met these five years: Marriage, Travel, Business, and your
Retirement, Sir Richard, have thus separated us


Us that for several years, of pleasant Frolique Youth were never asunder.


I call methinks a pleasant Season back, here is a brimmer to our old
Acquaintance


About with it.


But now it is late, we keep you out of Bed from your new Wife.


A Wife! Oh Friends take warning, marry not, I say, do not marry.


Why? you have a handsome Lady and a rich one.


Oh Gentlemen, I would be glad to have the Witch of Endor, were she alive
instead of her; I am linked to an Amozonian Devil, such a Thalestris, such a
perpetual Fixen, and a Shrew, such a Tongue, that 'twould be a Blessing to be
lodged in London, with a Silver-Smith under me, a Brazier over head, a
Trunk-maker and a Peuterer on either side of me, and all of 'em Industrious
Rogues to boot; a Blessing I say in Comparison of her continual Clamor, all
those Noises in consort are soft and gentle Harmony to her one single Voice


Methought she looked somewhat proudly, her Countenance between Scorn and Anger.


She wished crooked Pins in every bit of meat you eat, and Poison in every
Glass of Wine you swallowed


Say you so, it is time for us to leave you then.


No, fear not, this Night is the last of her short Reign, I have sent for her
Father to dine with me to morrow, and after dinner I will pack her away with
her separate maintenance, and then we'll spend the Christmas in Freedom, Mirth
and Jollity, and I am overjoyed you are here to be Witnesses of my Proceedings


Sir, my Lady commanded me to tell you, She Will rout you and your Lewd
Companions, if you come not away presently, I hope you will pardon me


Tell her I come, I am sent for. But here is the other Brimmer to my Deliverance.


Away with it.


I lay my whole misfortune now before you, I have not only married an
Indefatigable Scold, but a Phanatick into bargain; nay, I have married her
Chaplain too, who was, I take a Weaver, and ordained himself by virtue of
outward Grace and inward Knavery, have a care I warn you of a Bigot or Zealous
Woman, for be she never so wicked, she will be always so full of spiritual
Pride, She Will think you a Limb of Satan


It Is a just observation.


And for a Chaplain, I would as soon have a Russian in my House, for he must
Govern or the Wife will Rage


Right, Then, my Friends, I conjure ye have a care of separate maintenance, a
damned invention to make Whores and cursed Wives as bad, I would not marry the
Queen of Sheba were she alive, upon those Conditions


All this daily Experience tells us.


A Curse of an Owl that must try and would not trust Experience; but at his
own cost another Point is, for I am bound in Charity to warn you, have a care
of an ill born or ill bred Woman, there is as much in the Strain, as in Horses
or Dogs, we all take after our kind


You are in the Right of it, I have not heard a better Preaching.


And for breeding, though almost all Women are Fools, yet those that are well
bred, by the help of that will behave themselves with some Discretion and Good
manners at least, and now in what a Case am I, that am under all these Curses
which I warn you from? how irksome must it be to me, who with my first dear
Wife, that St. in Heaven, had all the happiness that man on Earth was capable
of


It Is hard, but like to be as short.


One more to the memory of my former Wife, a Brimmer to help to dround my
sorrow for this


Let it go round: we knew her.


She deserved all honor.


Now shame upon you and your filthy Companions, I Will make your Glasses and your
Bottles fly, and that Lewd Minister of your Debauchery, your Butler I Will rout
him, for not bringing me the Key of the Cellar a Rascal


Your Pardon, we are going.


Going? yes, to make one another drunk and sott all Night about it, ye may be
ashamed ye Beasts, why do I call you Beasts, Beasts, I scorn to be drunk like
you


This Gentlemen is my sweet Lady.


Gentlemen! your fellow Scotts, your guzling Drunkards, get you to bed ye
Spunges


Light the Gentlemen, your Fires are ready, you see I am under Correction sweet
Princess


If you in one, would sum up every Curse,
Take such a Spowse for better and for worse.
WE have had a hard Tug to give these Gentlemen's men their Belly's full.


But at last we have left 'em quickly up tosome Tune.


I am Bouzy and right for mischief; let us execute our design upon Non-con.


Have at him, are your Jack-chanes and humming Tops ready?


They are, I have 'em here, he must be drunk with a Pox to him, and could not
say Grace


A Curse on him, he staggered against my Side-Table, and brake twenty shillings
worth of flint Glasses. And though we all deposed against his Drunkenness, our
Pious Lady called us perjured Rogues, and said he had eaten some thing that did
not agree with him


And when we could not get him to himself, my Lady said it was an Apoplexy.


Ay, and made me heat a Drying Pan red hot, to hold over his Pate; from which
she had made the hair be shaved off


Nay She has employed all her skill in Physic upon him, She has laid a huge
Caustick-Plaister between his Neck and Shoulders to raise blisters, which will
make him roar before morning


His Head's all raw with the singeing, if he had not begun to roar, I belive
She would have Carbonado'd him, for his Apoplectick Drunkenness


What Sport it will be when he wakes! he will wonder what the Devil they have
done to him, he will be plauguy sore


Now he has almost slept out his first sleep, he will wake half sober, devilish
sick, and in pain, and 'twill be a fit time to begin our Persecution upon him


I am afraid we shall make him distracted with the Fright.


If we make him mad he may get some wit by the bargain, he is now so dull a
Rogue that any alteration would be for the best


Come put on the shapes.


Here, the Dogs will fit me, John Cook shall be the Bear, and you shall
represent great Beelzebub himself


Agreed, hang on your Chains, list how the Rogue sports like a Sackbut, let us
withdraw into our Tyring-Room, and then Enter


Mr. Chip, why Butler Chip, I say some small Beer, give me an Ocean of small
Beer, I will swim in small Beer


He Is between sleeping and waking, now to our Work.


Mercy on me where have I been? I am all on Fire, and my head all burnt, is the
Bed or the Room on Fire? fire, fire, fire, hah Heaven what Noise is that! hah
it is Satan verily, what Friends are those in Chains? Oh Faith, Faith! where
art thou? I am frail, frail, even as one of the Satan! sweet Satan, dear Satan,
spare me, thou mistakest me, tempt me not, I am not Righteous, I am wicked, yea
even as one of the Profane. I am an Hypocrite truly, a zealous Hypocrite
verily: Oh spare me, oh! oh! sweet Satan, dear Satan spare me


This is enough in the dark, now let him behold ye?


Oh, oh, I conceive there is a Light now in the Room, let me see if I dare open
my Eyes: Friend is this comes to me? it is like a Dog, oh! oh! I conjure thee,
Friend! say Satan forbear, oh what is here the Chief Devil! I dare not see any
more, oh sweet Beelzebub, spare me, mercy good Satan


Art thou a true seared Hypocrite?


Yea I am, I am.


Falsely zealous, and truly seditious?


Oh, oh, I, I am Sir.


Most immoderately given to thy Gut?


Yes, yes, my great delight is in Creature comforts.


The chief motive to thy Zeal, those Creature comforts, thou get'st by thy
Hypocroisie


Oh, oh! yes verily.


By this thou have committed Carnality with Elders Wives and Daughters; and
have been much given to Concupiscence


It Is true, most exceedingly.


You use not Copulation with the wicked, for fear of Scandal?


No, I engender only with the Righteous: Good Sir, have done, I am half
dissolved


By this thou get'st thy self made Executor and Trustee.


Oh yes, it is the chief end of my Profession to prey on Orphans.


Oh Rogue! ha what a dreadful Thunderclap was that.


What a storm is this arising?


Gods body what a Clap was there, it shook the House.


Come let us be gone, we have tormented him enough.


No, no, this storm will help us better to affright him.


The Rogue shall no longer rail at auricular Confession, who, has confessed as
he thinks to the Devil


Oh! I am almost dead, sure the Fiends are gone, and have carried this end of
the Building with them at that last Clap


Come, come 'tother bout.


Ay, come, come.


Hah Tom! what is this? we are four now.


Why Ned? we were but three, ha! one, two, three, four?


Ha John! what is the meaning of this? who is this?


Nay, what a Pox know I? I am sure we were but three, we are increased one in
Number


Foh, what a stink of Brimstone's here.


Let me see, what is he a doing?


There is silence, now let me peep out. Oh Heaven!


Here Parson eat this Toad, here will you eat this Toad?


Oh Heaven what is this! my Hair begins to stand on End.


Eat this Toad I say.


Oh, no good Satan, I hate a Toad, it is too like Fish, and I could never
endure Fish, because the Papists eat so much


Who will eat a Toad?


Oh the Devil, the Devil, oh! oh!


Help, help.


The Devil, the Devil.


If ever I fright any Body again, may I suffer the Strappado.


What noises are these? here are Thieves in my House; what, ho where are my
Servants


Here Sir, we are got up, there have been most horrible Disturbances in the
Parson's Chamber, he roars like a furious Bull with the Dog about him, listen


The Devil, the Devil: Murder, help, help.


Hang him the Rogue's drunk still, is it he that has disturbed the House?


Oh the Devil, the Devil, avoid thou Tempter.


What is the matter here?


Oh Sir Richard, we have been so disturbed with Noises, we thought some Rogues
had got into your House, and were committing a Robbery


It Is nothing but a Drunken Zealot, that has been troublesome in his Cupps, and
he has disturbed the House


Drunk! I defy thee and all thy works.


Ha, what Apparition is that?


Apparition, whose, where?


I shall soon make your Apparition vanish.


I have seen a Vision this Night.


What of Malt and Hops, Punch and Stratsbury Brandy, or a Fools-head in a
Looking-glass? take him and lock him into his Chambers


Oh for Heaven's sake! it is haunted with Devils, I have been tormented all
Night: They have laid a Plaster of melted Btimstone upon my Shoulders, and
singed my Head with sulphurous Flames, oh the Devil, the Devil


You shall disturb the House no more to Night: Gentlemen, I am sorry that this
Phanatick Preacher should disturb you, he was drunk last Night and fancies he is
haunted with Devils, he is nothing but frighted with the Thunder and Lightning,
at this time of the Winter


Which has been the strangest I ever heard, I thought the House had fallen
down, or at least part of it


Such Thunder in this Winter Season is prodigious, methinks it should fright
the Women out of their Wits


I could not wake my sweet Lady, She lay as if She were dead, I believe it is
her property to be silent in a storm, and ever tempestuous in a Calm


See what is a Clock by the Pendulum.


It Is within less than half an hour of five.


It Is almost time to think of hunting: you told us we should see your Harriers
run


Let Us to our Chambers and rest an hour or two; we have Game just by.


With all our Hearts.


Bid the Grooms be ready, Butler, Do you call us; and Cook be ready with a
Breakfast, come Gentlemen our way is the same


Well met, it is time we now be gone,
Already all our Work is done;
The Transformation's wrought so sure,
The Doctour's time it shall endure.
The Lady's in the Cobler's Hutt,
The Cobler's Wife to the Knight is put;
And we defy the sharpest Sight,
E're to distinguish which is Right.

What has the Devil been abroad to Night? I never heard such Thunderclaps and
such a Storm, I thought my little House would have flown away. But now all is
clear, and it is a fine Starlight Morning. Come I Will to work: Winters Thunder
is Summers wonder


In Bath a wanton Wife did dwell,
As Chaucer be did write;
Who wantonly did spend her Days
In many a fond Delight.
Upon a time sore Sick she was,
And at the length did Dye:
Her Soul at last at Heavens Gate
Did knock most mightily.
Then down came Adam to the Gate,
Who knocks there quoth he?
I am the Wife of Bath she said,
Who fain would come to thee.
Thou art a Sinner Adam said,
And here no place can have:
Alack for you good Sir she said,
Go Gipp you doting Knave.
How now? what impudent Ballad-singing Rogue's that, that dare wake me out of
my sleep? I Will have thee flead thou Rascal


Why? what a Pox, does this Jade talk in her sleep, or is she drunk still.


I will come In in spite, she said,
Of all such Churls as thee:
Thou art the cause of all our Pain,
Our Woe and Misery.
Thou first brokest the Commandments,
In pleasure of thy Wife.
When Adam heard her tell this Tale,
He ran away for Life.
Why Villain, Rascal, Screech-Owle; a worse Noise than a Dog hung in the
Pales, or a Hog in a great Wind. Here where are my Servants? come and hamstring
the Rogue


Why, how now you saucy Jade, you confounded Queen, you must be drunk with
Conjurers, you shall have money for Lambs-wool, you whoreson Drab


Death! what Dog is this? where is my Bell? I cannot find it to ring, where is my
Servants? I Will toss the Dog in a Blanket


She is asleep sure, and all this is a Dream; the Conjurer told her she should
keep a Coach, and she is dreaming of her Equipage, ha! ha


Why Husband, Sir Richard do you hear this Insolence?


Husband! Sir Richard! what a Pox has she Knighted me? my Name is Zekel too,
here is a jest indeed


Hah he is gone, he is not in the Bed, Oh Heaven! where am I? foh, what favor is
this in my Nostrils! here are stinking Lether Breeches, and a Lether Apron,
here are Canvas Sheets and filthy ragged Curtins, a Beastly Rug and Flock-Bed:
am I awake? or is all this Dream? what Rogue is that? Sirrah! where am I? who
brought me hither? Rogue! what Rascal are you


This is most amazing, I never heard such words from her, so God save me, if I
take my strap, I Will make you know your Husband, and teach you a little better
manners, you saucy Drab


Oh astonishing impudence! you my Husband! I Will have you hanged you Rogue, I Am
a Lady sirrah, let me know who gave me a sleeping Potion, and conveyed me
hither


A Sleeping Potion, a Pox on you, you drunken Jade, you had a sleeping Potion,
has not your Lambs-wool done working yet


Where am I? where has my damned villainous Husband put me? why, Jane, Lettis,
where are my Queans


Ha, ha, ha, what does she call her Maids? the Conjurers have not only made
her drunk, but mad too


He talks of Conjurers, sure I am bewitched, ha! what Clothes are here? here is
a Linsey-woolsey Gown, a Callicoe Hood, and a Red-Bays Petticoat, and Shoes
with Hobnails, I Am removed out of my own House by Witchcraft, what shall I do,
or what will become of me


Hark the Hunters and the merry Horns abroad, why Nell you lazy Jade! it is
Break of Day, come to work, come, come and spin you Drab, or I Will swinge your
lazy Hide for you; Pox on you must I be working two hours before you in a
Morning


Why Sirrah, you impudent Villain, do you know me?


Know you, yes, and will make you know me before I have done with you.


I am Sir Richard Lovemore's Lady, how came I here?


Sir Richard Lovemore's Lady, no not so bad yet, She Is a damned stingy
Phanatick Whore, and plagues every one that comes near her, the whole Country
curses her


Nay then I Will hold no longer, you Rogue, you insolent Villain have at you.


This is more than e're I saw by her, She Is mad sure, I never had an ill word
from her before, come Strap I Will try your mettle; I Will fetch you out of your
Drunken Fitts you maukin, come, come on Huswife


Oh murder, murder! I Will pull you throat out, I Will tear your Eyes out, I Am a
Lady sirrah, Sir Richard Lovemore will hang you for this


Why Neighbor Iobson, what is the matter? I was going to fodder my Cattle, and
hear murder cried here


Oh Fellow, do you know Sir Richard Lovemore?


Ay marry do I well enough, he is my Landlord, he is as honest a Gentleman as any
is in forty mile o'his head


Prithee Neighbor don't mind her, She was drunk yesterday with Conjurers,
She Is mad still, and I cannot get her up to her Spinning-work


Oh help me, I Am Sir Richard Lovemore's Lady, conveyed hither I know not how,
to be tormented and lamed by this outrageous Villain


Did not I tell you she was mad, come out you Jade, I Will fetch you to your
Spindle


Hold you Neighbor, this is a pretty Whirlegig? I know my Lady right well and
Goody Iobson too, ah Goody Iobson I Am sorry to see this, you are mad indeed, my
Lady Quo she


What a Pox, do you think I don't know my own Wife? that mole under her left
Eye


A Lady? no Neighbor Iobson, you are ten times a better Woman no Dispraise to
her, She Is the hearteats Jade that e're came in the Parish, the whole Country
curses her


Oh he has bruised me, and larned me, and I am almost dead with the stench of
this filthy place, either I am removed by Enchantment, or they have given me
Opium, and in a dead sleep they have brought me hither, are you in earnest?
look on me, do you not know my Lady Lovemore? I Will give you a hundred pound and
carry me home


Why you mad Beast, you my Lady Lovemore? A Pox on her, I know her well enough,
she gave me three or four damned Blows of the Pate last Night, in her own House


I did so, I remember you now, I did give you those Blows on the pate, in my
House last Night


Why Goody Iobson, why do you think I Am blind? I do not know my Lady? a plaguey
Queen, why all the Country rings of her


This is a Conspiracy of Rogues.


Help, help, if She be not my Lady, she has learnt of my Lady.


Is this the Rogue my Husbands revenge upon me? here is Clothes, here is filthy
Rags; ob foh! oh miserable Woman! I shall be delivered and make 'em rue for it


Come, come you Queen, I Will make you leave your fooling, come to your Spindle,
or else I Will lamb your Hide, you were never lamb'd so since you were an Inch
long. Take it up you Jade


Hold, hold, what shall I do? I cannot spin.


Oh! I thought I should bring you to your self to work, I Will into my Stall,
it is broad day now, why, when you awkard Jade? I think her Brains are turned,
She has forgot to spin


I know this place, I Will try my Feet, I Will run into the Town, some body will
succor me there sure


What does the Jade run for it? I Will after her.


What Heavenly dreams I have had this Night? methought I was in Paradise, upon
a Bed of Roses, and of Violets, and the sweetest Husband by my side; sure it
was a Dream, Ha! where am I now? bless us! what sweets are these about me? no
Garden in the Spring can equal them, not Buds of Roses with the Dew upon them,
am I upon a Bed? the Sheets are Sarcenet sure; no Linen ever was so fine, what
a gay silken Robe have I gotten? Oh Heaven I dream! I dream nothing but Point
and Lace, and Gold, and Fringe. Oh let me never wake! nothing but Gold, fine
Works and Carving: oh Father what a Glass is there! there is a sumptuous Carpet
upon the Table and silver Plate, sure I died to night in my sleep, and am gone
to Heaven and this is it


Now must I go to be called Whore or Jade, and fifty other Names, I must wake
an alarm that will not lie still till Midnight at the soonest, Madam. Madam


Lord who this, what say thou sweet Heart?


Sweet heart, O Lord Sweet heart! the best Names I have had these twelve Months
from her, have been Whore or Jade: Madam, what Gown and what Ruffles, will your
Ladyship please to wear to Day


Oh Lord what does she mean? Ladyship, Gown and Ruffles, sure I am awake now, I
remember the Cunningman


Say you Madam?


The same I did yesterday Child.


Mercy upon me! Child! here is a Miracle!


Is my Lady awake, and have you had e'rea slipper or a shoe flung at your Head
yet


Oh no, I am overjoyed, she is in the kindest humor, nothing but Love and
Sweetness, go to the Bed and speak to her now, now is your time


You laugh at me, now is your time says she, what to have an Eye beaten out or
another Tooth? Madam


What say thou Girl? Father, what would she have?


What work will your Ladyship have me do to day? shall I work Plain-work, or go
on my Parchment


Work say thou, why? it is holiday Child, no work to Day.


Oh mercy, am I or she awake! or do we both dream?


Did not I tell you?


Here Is a blessed Change!


If it continues we are all made, we shall be a happy Family.


Who Is that?


Now shall I be condemned to the Dog-whip, instead of a Breakfast.


Some Billets for your Ladyships fire?


That Is a good Boy.


O Lord! O Lord, is that my Lady?


Go Sir, she is in rare humor.


Prithee Sweetheart give me my things, I Will rise, I cannot abide to lie in Bed.


Have I my senses or not, Good Lack?


This Cunning-man is a rare Man: he said I must bear it out, I Am amazed? I know
not what to do


Here Is your Ladyships Morning Gown.


Where are my Eyes? they are Dazzled, this is a Robe fit for an Angel to wear.
Bless me, I shall not know my self


Your Ladyships Chocolate's ready.


Mercy on me what is that? it is some Garment sure! well put it on then
Sweetheart


Put it on Madam, I have taken it off, it is ready to Drink.


Drink says she, I mean, put it by, I don't care for Drinking.


Now go I like a Bear to the stake, to know what her Scurvy Ladyship will have
for Breakfast, how many Rascally names shall I be called


You are mistaken, there never was such a change, she is nothing but Goodness,
you will be overjoyed to hear her


You arch Dog! I Will lug you by the Ears Sirrah, if you play the Rogue with me.


Oh! John Cook you will be out of your wits to see this change, oh! she is the
sweetest Lady


What the Devil are they all mad!


Madam, here is the Cook come to know what your Ladyship will please to have for
Breakfast


Oh Lord there is a fine Cook: He looks like one of your Gentlefolks.


Here Is Humility! what a Conversion's here?


Hey what is to do here! what the Devil's the matter! my Head turns round:
where am I? honest Man! I looked for Rogue or Rascal at the best


Oh Madam that will lie heavy upon your Ladiship's Stomach: he will get you some
rare dainty Dish immediately


Do then e'ne what twoo't good Mr. Cook.


Good Lord! good Mr. Cook! Ohcis a sweet Lady.

Chip, kiss me, prithee kiss me I say: I Am out of my Wits. We have the rarest
Lady, the sweetest Lady that ever Men served: go and be astonished as I am


You shamming Rogue, I think you are out of your Wits indeed; what the Devil
does he mean? the Maid looks merrily too


Chip the Butler is come Madam to know what your Ladyship will please to drink:
Come near Mr. Chip. You Will be amazed


Good Mr. Chip, let me have some good Small Beer when my Breakfast comes up.


Mr. Chip! Mr. Chip! I shall be turned into a Stone with amazement. Madam,
would not your Ladyship please to have a Glass of Frontinuque or Lachrimoe


Oh me, what hard Names are these! I must not betray my self.


Heaven and Earth, I Am amazed! here will be Joy! go get you in and be happy as
I am. Joy, Joy


The Cook has been bantring I do know not how long Do the Butler banter too?


Madam the Coachman is at the Door.


Come in good Coachman.


Will your Ladyship please to take the Air to day? if so, which will you have
the Coach or the Chariot


Thank you, which you think convenient.


O Heaven! the Sky will fall, what is this?


Sure I cannot be awake, how overjoyed they all seem to wait on me, Oh notable
Cunning man, I Am the happiest Woman, I grow giddy with my happiness, I Will
retire and give Heaven thanks for this,


Common Prayer Book! here is a turn, what will Non-con say? your Ladyship has
none, but here is my Master's


Thank you Sweet heart.


How do you like this Gentlemen? we have had a smart turn or two.


I never followed fleeter Dogs that had any Noses.


I hate your mere fleet Hounds, that kill presently in view, it is as bad as
coursing


Methinks there is Pleasure to see 'em hit it off at a fault, as well as there
is in a hard riding


And to see the Doubles, and Shifts an old Hare will make for her Life, faith
beyond a Fox


I spare my Horses to day which made me come home so soon, but to morrow you
shall try my Fox-hounds, and then Gentlemen I will lead you a dance


Sir, here is the rarest News.


There never was the like, Sir you will be overjoyed and amazed.


What are ye mad? what is the matter with you?


How now? what is the matter? here is a new Face in my Family, what all joy and
mirth, what does it mean, or is it a Christmas Gambal


Oh Sir the Family is turned topsie turvy, we are almost distracted, we are the
happiest People


I cannot contain my self, my self, my Lady, Sir my Lady.


what is she dead?


Dead! no Heaven forfend, she is the best Lady, the swetest Lady.


Oh the dearest, kindest Lady, you are the happiest man Sir living.


Never was such a change, such a miracle, why, all the House will lay down
their Lives for her


She has obliged us all the kindliest and the sweetliest, we'll live and dye
with her


Ay, all, all of us, long live her Ladyship, God bless her Ladyship.


Oh She Is the best Lady in the World, I could kiss the Ground she goes on.


I could lick the Dirt of her Shoes, she is the sweetest, gentliest natured Lady
breathing


Why? give me Breath a little, what do you mean?


It Is true, it is true Sir, go into her your self, and be witness of her strange
change, none but Heaven could work such a miracle


This is most astonishing, Gentlemen you see how I am surprised, if you please
to dress, I Will in and see the meaning of this Wonder, I Am impatient till I go
in


Sir you may put off your Boots and dress first, She Is at Prayers with the
Common Prayer Book in her Closet, and will be private for half an hour


How, Common Prayer Book? new Prodygies! what miraculous Power has been here at
work? my Friends, if this be true I shall rejoice indeed


True, ay it is true enough, long live Sir Richard and his Lady, Heaven bless
'em both, Huzah, Huzah


I well remember the Cunning-man warned me to bear all out with Confidence, or
worse he said would follow, I am ashamed and know not what to do with all this
Ceremony; I am amazed, and out of my Senses, I looked in the Glass, and saw a gay
fine thing I knew not, methought my Face was not at all like that I have seen
at Home, in a piece of a Looking Glass fastened upon the Cupboard. But great
Ladies they say have flattering Glasses, that show them far unlike themselves,
whilst Poor-folks Glasses show them as they are


Oh Madam, Here Is my Master now returned from Hunting.


Oh Heaven! this goodly Gentleman my Husband?


My Dear; I am extremely pleased to see my Family thus transformed to all the
joy imaginable, which as they tell me, you have created in them


Sir I shall be always overjoyed, at what gives you delight, and shall be ever
glad, if I can please your Family


Oh Divine Softness! this Gentleness of thine transports me.


Alas Sir what am I? I am ashamed of my own meanness, I shall be glad to be a
Fellow Servant here, you are Lord of all Sir


Dear Creature, if thou continuest thus, I had rather be Lord of thee than of
the Indies


You make me Blush Sir; I hope I shall have Grace never to be otherwise.


I am astonished, can this be Real?


All that is good above can witness for me: I am in earnest.


Rise sweetest Creature, what has wrought this admirable change?


Alas! I never did offend you nor any of them.





It was not I; I sure was not my self then, indeed, I find my self so much
changed, I scarce know who I am


It is a blessed change.


It is so, I have that pleasure in my mind; that every thing I see ravishes me
with joy, such a sweet House, such brave Furniture, such ready loving Servants,
and so noble, so sweet a Lord and Master: Oh Father! I know not where I am
methinks


Heaven be thanked for this: I would not lose this Dear, this Blessed Creature,
for all the Wealth and Power that King's can boast off


It Is sure Heaven's doing: and I can never have another mind, it is wondrous
that I ever had methinks


And I am confirmed: Joy! Joy! Oh heart make room for Joy! it will overwhelm
you else, upon my knees I kiss this dear, dear hand: Thou art so rare a
Creature, I shall worship thee


Nay hold Sir! pray Sir! what do you do? Indeed you make me cry, I am so
ashamed, oh Father! so brave a Gentleman to kneel to me? it is My duty to do
that


Hold heart, I say contain thy self, where are my Friends, my Servants, call
them all, and let them be witnesses of my happiness


O Lord! how shall I behave my self before these Gentlefolks.


And will thou never child, nor quarrel with me more, and show thy fury
amongst my Servants


I Will cut my Tongue out first, oh Lord I chidel.


I have one thing more, will thou go to Church with me, and leave the sniveling
Conventicle


Yes surely Sir, I Will do what e're you please, I Will have nothing to do with
Fanatics, they are a Melancholy ill conditioned People


Sure it was an Angel spoke in thee, thou art the best of all thy Sex, I hope
thou art convinced that the Phanatick Chaplain was drunk last night; would
thou let me discard him, there wants nothing then to complete my happiness


Yes, Heaven forbid else: what shall I disobey my Lord and Master?


Let me embrace my Dear, my Love, and prithee seal this promise with a kiss.


Oh rare sweet man! he smells all over like a Nosegay, Heaven preserve my wits.


Gentlemen, behold this day, here stands the hapstiest man that the sun shines
on, I am transported beyond my senses: I hear proclaim a Jubilee to all my
Family these three months: Summon in all the Country, I Will keep open house,
send for my Fiddlers, Hoboys, Trumpets, and all Instruments of joy: let all the
Bells in the Hundred Ring, let the Seeples Rock, and let the Ringers Drink
enough: here stands the best of Women and of Wives, the kindest and the
gentlest Mistress to her Servants: and she that has given me all this happiness


Lord Sir, you put me out of countenance, I blush, I Am sorry that I ever angered
any of you, indeed i will do you all the good I can, I should be to blame else


God bless my Lady, long live her Ladyship, we'll live and dye with her.


My Dear you did affront these Gentlemen last night, speak to them.


Indeed, I was not my self, i am sorry that I was uncivil, I hope in time to
mend


We are your Ladyships humble Servants, and largely must partake of the great
joy, which now possesses all the Family


Joy, Joy, to both the Bridegroom and the Bride; it is a new Wedding.


It Is true; some three months since, I did espouse her Body, this day I Am
married to her mind, this is a perfect Wedding: go send for all my Tenants,
there shall be naught but Feasts and Revels here


This will be a brave time, how I shall joy to see it.


Your Fiddlers were going by, having heard that my Lady would not allow of
Music, but I called them in


You did well; my Dear, do you not love Music?


Oh! I love nothing better.


That Is my joy, my life; call in my Music: Gentlemen, i will make them sing a
very unfashionable song to you, in the praise of marriage, a piece of my own
Poetry in my last Wives time

Let the vain Spark consume his store,
In keeping an expensive Whore,
For others to employ.
For all those snares, and baits he pays,
Which she for other Gallants lays,
And he must least enjoy.
Keep Whores then as perfumes you wear;
Of which your selves have the least share:
Of other's claps partake.
Your Bodies bring to the Surgeons hands,
And to the Scriveners all your Lands:
And give her your last Stake.
While with reason we bless the Fate,
That brings us to the Marriage State,
The only happy Life.
The chief enjoyment in a King,
No Wealth, no Power, such joy can bring;
As does a Wife, a tender Wife.
There can be no true Friend beside,
So often does interest divide;
But they are so conjoined.
By this most Sacred Rite are grown,
That they are not one flesh alone,
But they are both one Mind.

Sir, here are some Country Neighbors hearing of the happy conversion, desire
to dance before you


Let them come in.


What means this lewd noise; this most profane abominable Jigging? Lady I
must rebuke thee, in pure zeal, I must rebuke thee, I cannot bear it


Thou insolent fool be silent, I will have no Phanaticks, no Law-Breakers
within my Walls, especially no Hypocrites, you were drunk last night you Swine


I defy thy words, it was a fit, I was taken with a fit, a grievous fit: Lady,
what say you, are you become like one of the wicked ones


I will obey my Lord and Master, his will is mine.


Retire to your Chamber, you shall not be seen this day, to morrow I will tell
you more of my mind


What Is this, she is not as she was; Iampridem mulieri ne credas ne mortuoe
quidem; I may not go, I will not retire, my Zeal tells me, I must rebuke
thee, and I will thunder in thine Ears


Turn him out.


I may not go, I say I will not retire, my Zeal transporteth me, I am become
furious


Father you are welcome, doubly welcome; I sent for you upon another occasion
than I now find: Heaven has ordered things another way, we are all transported
with excess of joy, my Dear salute your Father


Good Heaven! my Father; what means this sure? I shall be distracted, but I
must bear it out


What means this, it is superstitious, and favors of Idolatry?


It Is nothing but her great Humility.


I like it not.


I shall endeavor then to please you Sir.


It Is well, I am glad to see you and my Son-in-Law well; but what is the cause
of this unwonted joy of this transport


The Cook has knocked to Dinner: let us in, you there shall have a full account,
and be a joyful witness of our Happiness


Was ever Woman yet so miserable? I cannot make one in the Village yet
acknowledge me, they sure are all of the Conspiracy, this wicked Husband of
mine has laid a Develish Plot against me, I for the present must submit that I
may get an opportunity into my hands for my Design, here comes a Rogue I will
have strangled, but now I yield


Come on Nell, art come to thy self yet?


Ay I thank you, I wonder what I ailed, this Cunningman put Powder in my Drink
most certainly


Powder! the Brewer put good store of powder of malt in it that is all, Powder
Quo' she, ha, ha, ha


I never was so days of my Life.


Was so, no, nor I hope never will be so again, to put me to the trouble of
strapping you so Devilishly


I Will have that Right hand cut off, for that you were unmercifull to bruise me
so


Why? Faith I Am sorry for it, but it did you a great deal of good tho, why? you
would have been mad and called your self my Lady Lovemore till this time else,
why come, why don't you Spin


I cannot you have bruised my Arms so, when they are well I Will work hard.


That Is my good Girl, I Will buy some Plums to make thee a minced Pie, come let us
be friends, faith kiss and friends


Oh cursed impudent Rascal, what does he say?


Nay, prithee now, faith I will not strap thee so no more.


I must stay till this be well, before I forget it.


Ounz if you go to that, I will kiss you.


Oh soh, how the Beast stinks of Cheese, Leather-apron, Pitch, Grease, foul
Linen and old Shoes


Why Neighbor Iobson? Why don't you put on your Bond, and go to the Hall-place?


Why, what is the matter?


Matter! why? there is such a change, they are all out of their Wits, there is
open House to be kept there till Candlemas, all the Tennants are sent for, why
you will loose your Dinner


What do I hear? here is fine work indeed.


What the Devil is to do there? is that Damned Jade my Lady dead?


Nay I know not, we shall hear when I go, the Bells ring, do you not hear 'em?
and there is order given for all the Parishes hereabouts to ring, Barrels of
Beer, Flaggons of Brandy and Money for the Ringers, and Alms to all the Poor
are ordered


Death what is this? Here Is a rout when I am gone, did they pack me away for
this, I shall have all my Estate run out


Come, come, make have.


Husband, shall not I go with you?


Why, what all'st thou? Did not I tell thee I would strap thee yesterday for
desiring to go, art thou at it again


What does this Villain mean by strapping, and yesterday?


What a Pox, I have been married but six weeks, and you long to make me a
Cuckold already, stay at home there is good cold Pie in the Cupboard. But I Will
trust you no more with strong Beer Huzwife


Well, you will have your way, I must do what you bid me.


That Is a good Wench, God be with you, come on Neighbors.


And I Will be there not long after you, sure I shall meet some there that are
not of the Conspiracy


Son-in-Law Sir Richard I long to see Mr. Noddy, methinks I did not eat the
meat with Appetite since he did not bless the Creature


Sir to tell you the truth he is very sick, he was drunk last night, I am sorry
to say it to you


Son-in-Law, I know you are a Lukewarm Formalist of the Episcopal way, and you
are glad to say it, but I believe it not


Pardon me Sir, I do not use to lie, the whole Family are witnesses of it.


I fear me they are all too much of the same Batch, will my Daughter affirm
this


I must needs say what Sir Richard says.


Come Gentlemen, perhaps he might e're he was aware be overtaken with the
Creature, he might be transported perhaps with Zeal and so the sooner
overtaken, and so it is not a sin, but a frailty in him that is Righteous: I
must see him


But it is a sin in us: very good Doctrine.

Though Zeal stand Sentry at the Gate of Sin,
Yet all that have the Word pass freely In.

I am sorry to see you ill Mr. Noddy.


Bless your Worship.


Now we have dined let him give Thanks.


Here Is a Riot and a Rout, you sirrah, Butler, Rogue.


Why how now? what a Pox is to do with you? who are you?


Impudent Varlet! don't you know your Lady?


Why how now you Queen? here, turn this Madwoman out of Doors.


S' Life you Rascal take that sirrah, why sirrah? don't you know your Lady? my
Lady Lovemore, hands off, I am she you Rogue


Why you faucy Jade? Huzwife have a care here is a good pump, we'll cool your
Courage for you


Why Jane? Huzwife, sure you do not forget me?


Forget thee Woman! why? I never remembeed thee, I never saw thee in my Life.


Oh wicked Slut! I Will give thee cause to remember me.


Oh murder! murder! help, help!


How now, what Uproar's there?


You Jade, Lettice! what will not you know me neither? I Will make you know your
Lady


Help, help!


What Is to do there?


Why? here is a Madwoman falls a beating and lugging us, and calls her self my
Lady


Some Christmas frolic, some Neighbor has a mind to be merry.


I warrant it is a Bess of Bedlam.


Oh here is my Chaplain, sure he is not of the Conspiracy against me! Mr. Noddy!
Thou art an holy man


I am so Woman, what would thou have with me?


What are you blind? do you not know me because I have these filthy Clothes on?
look on my Face, I am the most injured, the most abused Lady that ever yet drew
Breath


Lady! Woman, art thou not mad in truth?


Why sirrah, are not you my Chaplain? You base Villain, did not I lay on the
Plaster to your shoulders, and a red hot Pan to your Head last Night, and
saved your Life


Oh Heaven! this is the Sorceress that bewitched me this Night, lay hold on her
she is a Witch


Why Master Noddy? art not thou troubled in Spirit? it is surely a Trick, a
Gambal


My Father here! I am so distracted with my grieff and sufferings I did not see
you, but now I must embrace you, and never leave you till you succor and
revenge me, for the most Barbarous usage that ever Lady suffered: speak, will
you not speak to me, Honored Father


I know thee not, I fear thou art some lewd woman; be gone, hands off.


Nay, then I am desperately miserable.


She a is Witch and did confess it to me, I will have her burnt.


Stand by, there must be something more than ordinary in this Business.


What the Devil can this mean?


What should it mean? some poor Madwoman is got loose.


Why? I never saw thee, thou my Wife? poor Creature I pity thee.


Nay it is in vain to hope for Redress from thee, thou wicked Contriver of all
my Misery


How I am amazed! is that I there in my Clothes, that have made this
disturbance? oh Father! I am here in these fine Clothes, how can this be? and
yet to my thinking I am there, I am so confounded and affrighted, that I shall
begin to wish I were with Zekell Iobson again


To whom shall I apply my self? or whither shall I fly? oh Heaven what do I
see! Is not that I there in my Gown and Petticoat I wore yesterday? how can it
be when I am here? I can not be in two places at once


Surely no, unless thou were a Bird, but come Sir let us be deaf to these vile
Gambals and retire


Poor Creature she is stark mad.


What in the Devil's Name, was I here before I came hither? that I should come
hither, and find that I was here before I came is the strangest thing to me,
let me look in this Glass, Oh Heaven I am confounded, I know not my self, if
that be I that is represented in the Glass, I never saw my self before


What incoherent madness is this?





Ay that must be the Devil that is in your Likeness, remember my strap you Queen.


How inevitably wretched am I?


O Lord, I am afraid my Husband will beat me that am on yonder side?


Gallants pray pardon her, she was drinking with a Conjurer last Night, and she
has been mad ever since, and says she is my Lady Lovemore


Poor Woman take care of her, and do not hurt her, she may be cured of this.


Cured, yes and please your Worship, you shall see me cure her with this strap
immediately, Huzwife do you see this


Hold, hold, pray do not beat me Zekel.


What says my Dear? Does she insect thee with madness too?


I am not well, my head turns round.


Wait on your Lady in.


I beseech your Worship don't take it ill of me, she shall never trouble you
more


Take her home and use her kindly, I Will send my Physician to her shall cure her
I warrant you


Thank your Worship most kindly, come Nell.


What will become of me?


How now, where is my Father-in-Law?


He has taken Coach, he bid me tell you he loves no Christmas-Gambals, and he
took this for one


It is a very odd one take it all together, as e're I saw?


Methought there was a Method in her madness, she did not know her self in the
Glass


And if you observed, your Lady uttered some strange words.


She did so, which did very much amaze me.


But that I have not much Belief in Magic, I should have odd thoughts of this.


Now you have put me in mind of it, there was something in the latter part of
this story, very strange and very surprising


Sir, the Doctor who called here last Night, desires a word in private with you
on earnest Business


What can this mean? bring him to me.


We'll take a turn and wait on you suddenly.


Your servant Gentlemen, be gone Servants.


Low on my knees I fall, and beg your pardon, and put my Life into your hands,
I have exercised my art of Magic on your Lady, I know you are an honorable
Man, and will not take my Life, who might have still concealed it from you, if
I had pleased


Methinks you have brought me to a glimpse of misery, too great for me to bear,
is all my happiness come only to a short Live'd Vision and a Dream


Sir I beseech you fear not, if there be any harm toward you, I freely give
you leave to hang me


Can Magic bring me any thing but ill?


I never yet did mischief by my Art, there are Aerial Spirits I command which
do no hurt, they are Sylphs


What have you done? inform me.


I have so transformed your Lady's face, she seems to be the Cobler's Wife,
and charmed the face of Iobson's Wife into the Likeness of your Ladies, and
when the storm arose, my Spirits removed each to the others Bed


Oh miserable wretch thou have undone me, I am fallen from the top of all my
hopes, and still must have a most tempestuous Wife, that fury whom I never yet
knew quiet, since the first minute I had her


If that were all, I could continue the Charm for both their Lives.


I Will have no happiness from Hell, all my Blessings must come from Heaven, and
I will hang you if you will not undo your Charm, let the event be what it will


I Will do it in a moment, and perhaps you will find it is the luckiest moment of
your Life, I can well assure you your Lady will prove the best of Wives, give
me your pardon Sir


Upon condition you undo the Charm I will.


It shall be done, and you shall find all my Praediction true.


Hold there is yet a material thing, which I must know.


I will resolve you Sir.


May be to Crown this mischief I have suffered, the Cobbler may perhaps have
made me Cuckold


Then cut this Throat, for e're she was transported to that Bed; the Cobbler was
got up, besides he has done naught but beat her ever since, and you are like to
reap the benefit of his Labor


Go about the business, i will send for him and her.


I can assure you, there is no staying for you in this Family; my Lady has
yielded all up to my Mistress's power


Why look thee Edward Chip; thou art mistaken in me, I can conform in many
things, rather than leave so good a House and so good People


Where there is so much eating.


At least though I cannot conform inwardly, I will conform outwardly; and that
will do your business as well, give us some Wine, they shall see what I can do


With all my heart, Gentlemen you are come in good time to be merry with Mr.
Noddy


Ay God I Am in a merry humor.


Here Is a pretty turn.


Give me a Beer-glass, here is the King and all the Royal Family, Huzzah: to
'ther, here is Sir Richard Lovemore's, huzzah: the to'ther, nay Gad take me give
me a third, here is my Ladies, huzzah: pledge me all of you, and let every
Bumper be a facer thus


Is that a facer, faith it is very pretty.


Nounz I Will have you to know, I can be as good Company as e're a he that wears
a head

He that wears a brave Soul, and dares honestly do,
He Is a Herald to himself and a Godfather too.

Here Is a Transformation.


Come faith, let us sing a Catch.

A Boat, a Boat, haste to the Ferry,
For we come over to be merry;
To laugh and Quaff, and drink old Sherry.

Here Is a turn; here is a Hypocritical Rogue, I think we shall have Ovid's
Metamorphosis in this House, but I am too much concerned to mind this
Diversion: but where are my Friends I wonder


Come on Friends, and fall heartily to our Christmas Gambals after a Rouse or
two


What you tell us Sir has much of wonder in it.


It is prodigious if it prove true.


Come now, lets have a dance.


Now Parson let us have one Christmass-Gambal, we'll play the Blacksmith.


Ay come with all my heart, how is that?


Come we'll show you, you shall down first, here, lie down upon this form.


Ay come, come, Gad I Am almost drunk.


Come I Will play the Smith and blow the Bellows, ye are my two Journey-men.


We are ready.


Be sure you lay him on.


How now Iobson, have you brought your Wife with you?


Yes and please your Worship, she is here at the Door, a little from the House
she fell into a Swoon'd, I thought I never should have recovered her. But at
last a tweak or two by the Nose, and half a Dozen straps has done the Business,
here where are you Huswife, come in


Light there it is very dark.


O Heaven and Earth, what is this my Lady?


What does he say, is my Wife changed to my Lady?


I thought the other was too good to be my Lady.


Heaven to punish me most sharply for my Crimes, Heaven left me to suffer under
the power of Enchantment, I am fully sensible of all my faults, and since I
abhor 'em and detest my self for them, I hope that Heaven and you will pardon
me, here will I kneel and fix till I have procured yours at least, and Heaven
be witness to my Resolutions. The Remnant of my Life shall be employed in duty
and observance of you, if you will vouchsafe to take me to your Bosom


Rise Madam I forgive you, and if you be sincere, you will make me happier than
all the Enjoyments of the world could do


What a pox must I lose my Wife thus? where the Devil is my to'ther wife?
here is conjuring indeed


Oh Sir the strangest accident has happened, it has amazed us, and almost
bereft us of our senses, my Lady was in so great a swound we thought she had
been dead


And when she came to her self, she proved another woman.


Ha, ha, that is a Bull indeed.


She is so changed I know her not, I never saw her face before, O Lord is this
my Lady


I shall be beaten again.


I thought our happiness was too great to last.


Fear not my Servants, Sir let 'em all be called in, I will give ease and quiet
to your Family, I am a hearty Penitent, good Servants I acknowledge I have
Heaven has given me another mind, it shall be my endeavor to make ye all
happy. I Am sure no Mistress shall outdoe me in Kindness and in Gentleness


Hold in this mind, thou will be the best of women, and I the happiest of men,
the other was false and short lived Joy, but this I hope will long continue


May Heaven wreak all its vengeance on me if once I alter from this Resolution,
or e're I contradict your will again


This is a day of wonders.


My head turns round I must go home, why Zekel what are you there?


Look you, look you now, hey day, what a Devil, what is that Queen my wife?
here is a rare business, Gad I dare not come near her


It Is rare indeed, we have all this day been under the Power of Enchantment, to
which Heaven knows there was not my least Consent. Heaven often turns even the
malice of Devils to produce a good end, this is no doubt a happy change, I Will
celebrate it with all the joy I did proclaim, for my late short lived Vision


To me it is happier than my Birthday was.


Now Madam since you have resigned your will to me, where is the Chaplain?


Here Mr. Noddy where are you? he is in the Buttery, here come in.


Behold your saint here.


I do confess my self in the wrong.


Go Hypocrite, I discard thee.


Discard me for what, Nounz I Will conform, what a Pox do you mean?


Thou wicked Wretch, thou scandal to thy own Profession, would thou
maliciously thus bring one on ours, by thinking to conform by being vicious?
detested Beast be gone, carry him to his Chamber, our Church condemns all such
Debauchery, though such vile wretches would bring a scandal on it. Give him ten
Pound, and in the Morning send him packing: here Iobson take they fine wife


But hold Sir, did not your Worship Sir make me a Cuckold under the Rose?


No upon my honor nor ever kissed her till I came from hunting, she was my
Bedfellow for a little while, and for this happy change, I Will give thee with
her five hundred Pound, buy store of Lether, and be my Shoemaker, I Will help
thee to all the Custom in the Country


He boys I am a Prince, a Prince, come hither Nell, come to thine own dear
Zekel, I Will never strap thee more


Indeed I have been in such a dream, I Am quite weary of it.


Can your good Ladyship forgive my strapping your good Ladyship so very much.


With all my heart, the joy of this blessed change makes all things good again.


Forsooth Madam will you please to take your Clothes, and let me have mine
again


No thou shall keep 'em, and I Will preserve thine as Relics.


Gentlemen let me present you to my Wife.


We wish your Ladyship all the joy your heart can hope for.


May all your Life be ever happy Madam.


Gentlemen pray pardon me, and I think I was a Madwoman last night, Heaven now
has brought me to my self


No more of this Subject.

Proclaim my joys in every place aloud,
Bonfires surround my house, let the Bells ring,
Let Us dance and revel, feast, carouze and sing.

Long live my Lady and Sir Richard.


Now let me speak if I may be so bold,
Naught but the Devil sure can tame a Scold.

COme Nell, prithee while I dress for the Dance speak something in my behalf to
these Friends of mine here, for I Am sure they are all Friends


Who I Zekel? Oh Lord you know, I wand dacity when I come before great Folks.


How now Huzwife dare you dispute it? remember my strap you Queen.


Hold, hold good Husband, I Will try what I can do?


Oh most curious fine Gentlefolks, I hope you will pardon me for being so bold,
but never stir, I Will never let you alone till I find you kind to poor Zekel,
for he is as pretty a Fellow as e're strapp'd Wife


Why how now, what a Pox is all this for? what speak an Epilogue in Prose? (the
Devil) I could have done that my self you foolish Jade. For example now

Look you Huzwife, there is as good Prose as any is in England, but I must have
it in Verse, all beaten Verse, away with it


YOU cannot sure ungenerously refuse,
The first address of a young tender muse;
So modest that she never attempts to fly,
Up to the lofty pitch of Comedy:
Farce is her aim, the persons low and mean,
Humble the language homely it the seen.
Let this poor shrub secure from censure grow,
For all the Critiques stormy rage too low:
If you will your thundering indignation vent,
Let it on lofty bumbast all be spent.
Applauded nonsense where sad lovers pine,
And Hero's rant and fight and cry and whine;
And the old buskins empty swelling strains,
That cracks the Player's lungs and Poet's brains.
These, these are triumphs for your forces fit,
But who upon a Droll e're spent his wit;
Or crititiz'd on Merry Andrew yet?
Whilst all the lofty Frigots you attacque,
Pray let in safety pass this little smack.
Your shot against us will wast 'ith empty sky,
The whistling bullets over our heads will fly;
We lie so low your Canon mount too high.
