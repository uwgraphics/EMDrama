Which is upon this Stage: In the Front is erected the Crest of the Worshipful
Company of Grocers, being the figure of a Camel of magnitude, lively carved,
and aptly painted, on whose bunch-back (in a riding posture) sits a
Negro-Boy, beautifully Black, betwixt two Silver Panyers that are fraught with
several sorts of Fruits, as Raysons, Almonds, Figs, Dates, Prunes, and other

holding in one Arm a Pillar of Marble, and in the other Hand a Shield Vert,
charged with an Armed Citadel or Tower, Argent, bearing a Flag on the
Battlements, Gules. On the Left hand of Pallas, in Correspondent Order,
sits, first, LAW, a proper Lady, aptly attired, having on her a long, Sable,
plain Robe, with a Mantle of Scarlet, and on her Head (adorned with long,
curled Brown Hair) a round flat Velvet Cap, turned up with a Rose of Diamonds:
next to her sits PIETY, in a White Robe, with a Black Mantle, a Book in one
Hand, and an Hourglass in the other; and on her Head a bright, long Silver
Vail reaching all over her Shoulders: and next to her sittteth a Sober person
representing GOVERNMENT, in a Scarlet Robe faced with Furrs; about her Neck a
Chain of Gold, and on her Head a Cap of Maintenance; in one Hand the Kings
Banner, in the other the Cities. His Lordship being fixed in the posture of
attention, Pallas rises up, descends to the Stage, and makes Address in
these Expressions

The First SPEECH, spoken by Pallas.

I Am the Deity of Arts and Arms,
That do by Sciences and loud Alarms
Give Orders to the Universe, from me
Does issue both Art and Artillery;
My Name is Pallas, by me Men are endu'd
With Justice, Law, Prudence and Fortitude.
