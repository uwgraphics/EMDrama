AS in battles, so in all other actions that are to be reported, the first,
and most necessary part is the description of the place, with his oportunities,
and properties, whether they be natural, or artificial. The great hall
(wherein the Mask was presented) received this division, and order: The upper
part where the cloth and chair of State were placed, had scaffoldes and seats
on either side continued to the skreene; right before it was made a partition
for the dancing place; on the right hand whereof were consorted ten Musitions,
with Basse and Mean Lutes, a Bandora, a double Sack-bott, and an Harpsicord,
with two treble Violins; on the other side somewhat nearer the skreene were
placed 9. Violins and three Lutes, and to answer both the Consorts (as it were
in a triangle) six Cornets, and six Chapel voices, were seated almost right
against them, in a place raised higher in respect of the pearcing sound of
those Instruments-eighteen foot from the skreen, an other Stage was raised
higher by a yearde then that which was prepared for dancing: This higher Stage
was all enclosed with a double vale, so artificially painted, that it seemed as
if dark clouds had hung before it: within that shrowde was concealed a green
valley, with green trees round about it, and in the midst of them nine golden
trees of fifteen foot high, with arms and branches very glorious to behold:
From the which grove toward the State was made a broad descent to the dancing
place, just in the midst of it; on either hand were two ascents, like the sides
of two hills, dressed with shrubbes and trees; that on the right hand leading to
the bower of Flora: the other to the house of Night; which bower and house were
placed opposite at either end of the skreene, and between them both was raised
a hill, hanging like a cliffe over the grove below, and on the top of it a
goodly large tree was set, supposed to be the tree of Diana; behind the which
toward the window was a small descent, with an other spreading hill that climed
up to the top of the window, with many trees on the height of it, whereby
those that played on the Hoboyes at the Kings entrance into the hall were
shadowed: The bower of Flora was very spacious, garnisht with all kind of
flowers, and flowrie branches with lights in them; the house of Night ample,
and stately, with black pillors, whereon many stars of gold were fixed:
within it when it was empty, appeared nothing but clouds and stars, and on
the top of it stood three Turrets underpropped with small black starred pillars,
the middlemost being highest and greatest, the other two of equal proportion:
about it were placed on wire artificial Battes, and Owls, continually moving:
with many other inventions, the which for brevity sake I pass by with silence

Thus much for the place, and now from thence let us come to the persons.

The Maskers names were these, (whom both for order and honor I mention in the
first place

Their number Nine, the best and amplest of numbers, for as in Music seven
notes contain all variety, the eight being in nature the same with the first,
so in nu^bring after the ninth we begin again, the tenth being as it were the
Diappason in Arithmetic. The number of 9. is famed by the Muses, and Worthies,
and it is of all the most apt for change, and diversity of proportion. The
chief habit which the Maskers did use, is set forth to your view in the first
leaf: They presented in their feigned persons the Knights of Apollo, who is the
father of heat, and youth, and consequently of amorous affections

These are the principal persons that bear sway in this invention, others
that are but secunders to these, I will describe in their proper places,
discoursing the Mask in order as it was performed

As soon as the King was entered the great Hall, the Hoboyes (out of the wood
on the top of the hill) entertained the time till his Majesty and his train
were placed, and then after a little expectation the consort of ten began to
play an Air, at the sound whereof the vale on the right hand was withdrawn,
and the ascent of the hill with the bower of Flora were discovered, where Flora
and Zepherus were busily plucking flowers from the Bower, and throwing them
into two baskets, which two Siluans held, who were attired in changeable
Taffatie, with wreathes of flowers on their heads. As soon as the baskets were
filled, they came down in this order, First Zepherus and Flora, then the two
Siluans with baskets after them: Four Siluans in green taffatie, and
wreathes, two bearing mean Lutes, the third a base Lute, and the fourth a
deep Bandora

As soon as they came to the descent toward the dancing place, the consort of
ten ceac't, and the four Siluans played the same Air, to which Zepherus and
the two other Siluans did sing these words in a base, Tenor, and treble voice,
and going up and down as they song, they strowed flowers all about the place

Flora robbed her bowers
To befrend this place with flowers;
Strowe about, strowe about,
The Sky rayn'd never kindlyer Showers.
Flowers with Bridalls well agree,
Fresh as Brides, and Bridgromes be,
Strowe about, strowe about,
And mix them with fit melody.
Earth has no Princelier flowers
Then Roses white, and Roses red,
But they must still be mingled.
And as a Rose new plucked from Venus thorn
So does a Bride her Bride grooms bed adorn.
Diverse diverse Flowers affect
For some private dear respect,
Strowe about, strew about,
Let every one his own protect.
But he is none of Floras friend
That will not the Rose commend.
Strew about, strew about,
Let Princes Princely flowers defend.
Roses the Gardens pride,
Are flowers for love, and flowers for Kings,
In courts desired, and Weddings.
And as a Rose in Venus bosom worn,
So does a Bridegroom his Brides bed adorn.
The Music cease, and Flora speaks.

FLowers and good wishes Flora does present,
Sweet flowers, the ceremonious ornament
Of maiden marriage, Beauty figuring,
And blooming youth, which though we careless fling
About this sacred place, let none profane
Think that these fruits from common hills are taken,
Or Vulgar valleys which do subject lie
To winters wrath, and cold mortality.
But these are hallowed and immortal flowers
With Floras hands gathered from Floras bowres.
Such are her presents, endless, as her love,
And such for ever may this nights joy prove.

FOr ever endless may this nights joy prove,
So eccocs Zephyrus the friend of love.
Whose aid Venus implores when she does bring
Into the naked world the green leau'd spring.
When of the Suns warm beams the Nets we weaue
That can the stubborn'st heart with love deceive.
That Queen of beauty, and desire by me
Breaths gently forth this Bridal prophecy.
Faithful and fruitful shall these Bedmates prove,
Blessed in their fortunes, honored in their love.

ALL grace this night, and Siluans so must you,
Offering your marriage song with cha^ges new

The song in form of a Dialogue.

WHO is the happier of the two,
A maid, or wife?

Which is more to be desired
Peace or strife?

What strife can be where two are one,
Or what delight to pine alone?

None such true friends, none so sweet life,
As that between the man and wife.

A maid is free, a wife is tied.

No maid but feign would be a Bride.

Why live so many single then.
It Is not I hope for want of men?

The bow and arrow both may fit,
And yet it is hard the mark to hit.

He leuels fair that by his side
Lays at night his lovely Bride.

Sing Io: Hymen, Io: Io: Hymen.

THis song being ended the whole vale is suddenly drawn, the grove and trees
of gold, and the hill with Dianas tree are at once discovered

Night appears in her house with her 9. hours, apparrelled in large robes of
black taffatie, painted thick with stars, their hairs long, black, and
spangled with gold, on their heads coronets of stars and their faces black,
every hour bore in his hand a black torch, painted with stars, and lighted.
Night presently descending from her house spoke as follows

VAnish dark vales, let night in glory shine
As she does burn in rage, come leave our shrine
You black hair'd hours, and guide us with your lights,
Flora has wakened wide our drowsy sprights
See where she triumphs, see her flowers are thrown,
And all about the seeds of malice sown?
Despightfull Flora is it not enough of grief
That Cynthia's robbed, but thou must grace the thief?
Or did not here Nights sovereign Queen complain
Hymen had stolen a Nymph out of her train.
And matched her here plighted henceforth to be
Loves friend, and stranger to Virginity
And make thou sport for this?

Be mild stern night
Flora does honor Cinthia, and her right,
Virginity is a voluntary power,
Free from constraint, even like an untouched flower
Meet to be gathered when it is thoroughly blown.
The Nymph was Cinthias while she was her own,
But now another claims in her a right
By fate reserved thereto, and wise foresight.

CAn Cynthia one kind virgins loss bemone?
How if perhaps she brings her ten for one?
Or can she miss one in so full a train?
Your Goddess does of too much store complain.
If all her Nymphs would ask advise of me
There should be fewer virgins then there be.
Nature ordaind not Men to live alone,
Where there are two, a Woman should be one.

THou breathe sweet poison wa^ton Zephyrus
But Cynthia must not be deluded thus.
Her holy Forests are by thieves profaned,
Her Virgins frighted, and lo, where they stand
That late were Phoebus Knights, turned now to trees
By Cynthias vengement for their injuries
In seeking to seduce her Nymphs with love:
Here they are sixth and never may remove
But by Dianaes power that stuck them here.
Apollos love to them does yet appear,
In that his beams has guilt them a they grow,
To make their misery yield the greater show.
But they shall tremble when sad Night does speak,
And at her stormy words their boughs shall break.

Toward the end of this speech Hesperus begins to de^cend by the house of
Night, and by that time the speech was finished he was ready to speak

Night, hail Queen of Flowers,
Mild sprited Zephyrus hail, Siluans and Hours.
Hesperus brings peace, cease then your needless iarres
Here in this little firmament of stars.
Cynthia is now by Phoebus pacified,
And well content her Nymph is made a Bride*
Since the fair match was by that Phoebus graced
Which in this happy Western I Will is placed
As he in heaven, one lamp enlightening all
That under his benign aspect does fall*
Deep Oracles he speaks, and he alone
For arts and wisdoms meet for Phoebus throne.
The Nymph is honored, and Diana pleased:
Night be you then, and your black hours appeased*
And friendly listen what your Queen by me
Farther commands, let this my credence be,
View it, and know it for the highest gemme,
That hung on her imperial Diadem.

I know, and honor it lovely Hesperus,
Speak then your message, both are welcome to

YOur Sovereign from the virtuous gem she sends us.
Bids you take power to retransforme the friends
Of Phoebus, metamorhpos'd here to trees,
And give them straight the shapes which they did leese.

This is her pleasure.

HEsperus I obey,
Night must needs yield when Phoebus gets the day.

Honored be Cynthia for this generous deed.

Pity grows only from celestial seed.

IF all seem glad, why should we only lowre?
Since to express gladness we have now most power.
Frolike graced Captives, we present you here
This glass, wherein your liberties appear,
Cynthia is pacified, and now blithe Night
Begins to shake off melancholy quite.

WHo should grace mirth, and revels but the night,
Next love she should be goddess of delight.

It Is now a time when (Zephyrus) all with dancing
Honor me, above day my state advancing.
I Will now be frolic, all is full of heart,
And even these trees for joy shall bear a part.
Zephyrus they shall dance.

Dance Goddess? how?

Seems that so full of strangenes to you now?
Did not the Thracian harp long since the same?
And (if we ripp the old records of fame)
Did not Amphions lyre the deaf stones call,
When they came dancing to the Theban wall?
Can music then joy? joy mountains moves
And why not trees? joys powerful when it loves.
Could the religious Oak speak Oracle
Like to the Gods? and the tree wounded tell
TO Aeneas his sad story? have trees therefore
The instruments of speech, and hearing more
Then th'aue of pacing, and to whom but Night
Belong enchantments? who can more affright
The eye with magic wonders? Night alone
Is fit for miracles, and this shall be one
Apt for this Nuptial dancing iollitie.
Earth then be soft and passable to free
These fettered roots? joy trees the time draws near
When in your better forms you shall appear.
Dancing, and music mnst prepare the way,
There Is little tedious time in such delay.
This spoken, the four Siluans played on their instruments the first strain
of this song following: and at the repetition thereof the voices sell in with
the instruments which were thus divided, a treble and a base were placed near
his Majesty, and an other treble and base near the grove, that the words of
the song might be heard of all, because the trees of gould instantly at the
first sound of their voices began to move, and dance according to the measure
of the time which the musicians kept in singing, and the nature of the words
which they delivered

Move now with measured sound
You charmed grove of gould,
Trace forth the sacred ground
That shall your forms unfold.
Diana, and the starry night for your Apollos sake
Endue your Siluan shapes with power this strange delight to make
Much joy must needs the place betide where trees for gladness move,
Afairer sight was nere beheld, or more expressing love.
Yet nearer Phoebus throne
Mete on your winding ways,
Your Brydall mirth make known
In your high-graced Hayes.
Let Hymen lead your sliding rounds, and guide the^ with his light,
While we do Io Hymen sing in honor of this night
Join three by three, for so the night by triple spel decrees
Now to release Apollos knights from these enchanted trees.

This dancing song being ended, the goulden trees stood in ranks three by
three, and Night ascended up to the grove, and spoke thus, touching the first
three severally with her wand

BY virtue of this wand, and touch divine,
These Siluan shadows back to earth resign,
Your native forms resume, with habit fair,
While solemn music shall enchant the air
Presently the Siluans with their four instruments,

Diana charge,
And The Earth obayes
Opening large
Her secret ways,
While Apollos charmed men
Their forms receive again.
Give gracious Phoebus honor then,
And so fall down, and rest behind the train
Give gracious Phoebus honor then and so fall etc.

When those words were sung, the three maskers made an honor to the King, and
so falling back the other six trees three by three came forward, and when
they were in their appointed places Night spoke* again thu

THus can celestials work in humane fate,
Transform, and form as they do love or hate.
Like touch, and change receive: the Gods agree
The best of numbers is contained in three.
The song of transformation again.

Night and Diana, etc.

THen Night touched the second three trees and the stage suncke with them as
before. And in brief the second three did in all points as the first: Then
night spoke again

THe last, and third of nine, touch magic wand,
And give them back their forms at nights command

Night touched the third 3. trees and the same charm of Night and Diana was
sung the third time, the last three trees were transformed, and the Maskers
raisd. When presently the first Music began his full Chorus

Again this song revive and sound it hie,
Long live Apollo Britains glorious eye.

THis Chorus was in manner of an Echo, seconded by the Cornets, then by the
consort of ten, then by the consort of twelve, and by a double Chorus of voices
standing on either side, the one against the other bearing five voices a piece,
and sometime every Chorus was heard severally, sometime mixed, but in the end
altogether: which kind of harmony so distinguished by the place, and by the
several nature of instruments, and changeable conveyance of the song, and
performed by so many excellent masters, as were actors in that music, (their
number in all amounting to forty two voices and instruments) could not but
yield great satisfaction to the hearers

While this Chorus was repeated twice over, the Nine maskers in their green
habitts solemnly descended to the dancing place, in such order as they were
to begin their dance, and as soon as the Chorus ended, the violins, or
consorte of twelve began to play the second new dance, which was taken in
form of an Echo by the cornetts, and then cat'cht in like manner by the
consort often, sometime they mingled two musickes together; sometime played all
at once; which kind of ecchoing music rarely became their Siluan attire, and
was so truly mixed together, that no dance could ever be better graced then
that, as (in such distraction of music) it was performed by the maskers.
After this dance Night descended from the grove, and addreste her speech to
the maskers, as follows

PHoebus is pleased, and all rejoice to see
His servants, from their golden prison free,
But yet since Cinthia has so freendly smilde,
And to you tree-borne Knights, is reconcild,
First ere you any more work undertake,
About her tree solemn procession make,
Dianas tree, the tree of Chastity,
That placed alone on yonder hill you see.
These green leau'drobes wherein disguisde you made
Stelths to her Nymphs through the thick forests shade
There to the goddess offer thankfully,
That she may not in vain appeased be.
The night shall guide you, and her hours attend you
That no ill eyes, or spirits shall offend you.

At the end of this speech Night began to lead the way alone, and after her an
Hour with his torch and after the hour a masker, and so in order one by one,
a torch-bearer and a masker, they march on toward Dianas tree. When the
Maskers came by the house of Night, every one by his hour received his helmet,
and had his false robe plucked off, and bearing it in his hand, with a low
honor offered it at the tree of Chastity, and so in his glorious habit, with
his hour before him marched to the bower of Flora. The shape of their habit
the picture before discouers, the stuff was of Carnation satin laid thick
with broad silver lace, their helmets being made of the same stuff. So
through the bower of Flora they came, where they joined two torch-bearers, and
two Maskers, and when they past down to the grove: the hours parted on either
side, and made way between them for the Maskers, who descended to the dancing
place in such order as they were to begin their third new dance. All this time
of procession the six Cornets, and six Chapel voices sung a sollemne motet
of six parts made upon these words

WIth spotles minds now mount we to the tree
Of single chastity.
The root is temperance grounded deep
Which the coldiewc't earth does steep:
Water it desires alone,
Other drink it thirsts for none:
Therewith the sober branches it does feed,
Which though they fruitless be,
Yet comely leaves they breed,
To beautify the tree,
Cynthia protectresse is, and for her sake,
We this grave procession make.
Chaste eyes and ears, pure hearts, and voices
Are graces wherein Phoebe most reioyces.
The motet being ended the Violins began the third new dance, which was lively
performed by the Maskers, after which they took forth the Ladies, and danced
the measures with them, which being finished, the Maskers brought the Ladies
back again to their places: and Hesperus with the rest descended from the
grove into the dancing place, and spoke to the Maskers as follows

KNights of Apollo proud of your new birth,
Pursue your triumphs still with joy and mirth,
Your changed fortunes, and redeemd estate
Hesperus to your Sovereign will relate,
It Is now high time he were far hence retired,
Th'ould Bridal friend, that vshers Night desired
Through the dim evening shades, then taking flight
Gives place and honor to the nuptial Night.
I that wished evening star must now make way
To Hymen's rights much wronged by my delay.
But on Nights princely state you ought to attend,
And t'honour your new reconciled frind.

HEsperus as you with concord came, even so
It Is meet that you with concord hence should go
Then join you that in voice, and art excel,
To give this star a musical farewell.

A Diologue of four voices two Bases and two trebles.

Of all the stars which is the kindest
To a loving Bride?

Hesperus when in the west
He does the day from night divide.

What message can be more respected
Then that which tells wished joys shall be effected?

Do not Brides watch the evening star?

O they can discern it far:

Love Bridegroomes revels?

But for fashion.

And why?

They hinder wished occasion.

Longing hearts and new delights,
Love short days, and long nights

HEsperus since you all stars excel
In Bridal kindness kindly farewell farewell.

WHile these words of the Chorus (kindly farewell farewell) were in singing
often repeated Hesperus took his leave seue ally of Night, Flora, and
Zephyrus, the Hours, and Siluans, and so while the Chorus was sung over the
second time, he was got up to the grove, where turning again to the singers,
and they to him. Hesperus took a second farwell of them, and so past away by
the house of Night: Then Night spoke these two lines, and therewith all retired
to the grove where they stood before

COme Flora let us now withdraw our train
That th'ecclipst revels may shine forth again

Now the Maskers began their lighter daunces as Currantoes, Leualtas and
galliards, wherein when they had spent as much time as they thought fit, night
spoke thus from the grove, and in her speech descended a little into the
dancing place

HEre stay, Night leaden-eied, and sprighted grows
And her late hours begin to hang their brows
Hymen long since the Bridal bed has dressed,
And longs to bring the turtles to their nest.
Then with one quick dence sound up your delight,
And with one song we will bid you all god-Night.

At the end of these words, the violins began the 4. new dance, which was
excelle^tly discharged by the Maskers, and it ended with a light change of
music and mesure: After the dance followed this dialogue of 2 voices, a base
and tenor sung by a Siluan, and an Hour

TEll me gentle hour of night
Wherein do thou most delight?

Not in sleep,

Wherein then?

In the frolic view of men?

Love thou music?

O it is sweet.

What Is dancing?

Even the mirth of feet

Joy you in Fayries and idelues?

We are of that sore our selves,
But Siluan say why do you love
Only to frequent the grove?

Life is fullest of content
Where delight is innocent.

Pleasure must vary not be long,
Come then lets close, and end our song.

YEt ere we vanish from this princely sight,
Let us bid Phoebus, and his states god-night

This Chorus was performed with several Echoes of music, and voices, in
manner as the great Chous before. At the end whereof the Maskers putting off
their visards, and helmets, made a low honor to the King, and attended his Ma:
to the banqueting plac

Neither buskin now, norbayes
Challenge I, a Ladies praise
Shall content my proudest hope,
Their applause was all my scope
And to their shrines properly
Revels dedicated be:
Whose soft ears none ought to pierce
But with smooth and gentle verse,
Let the tragic Poem swell,
Raising raging seendes from hell,
And let Epicke Dactils range
Swelling seas and Countries strange.
Little room small things contains
Easy praise quites easy pains.
Suffer them whose brows do sweat
To gain honor by the great.
It s enough if men me name
A Retailer of such fame.
