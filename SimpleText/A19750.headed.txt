WHy how now Puss, what ails my Monkie to chatter out of tune thus?


A whoreson senseless Coxcombe -- but I am glad thou art come, I long for a
pottle of wine and a Capon


Good provision for the present Monkie, but viderit futuritas, in the mean
time, who lays up for futurity? Come you raise four hundred per annum, out of
pottles of Wine and Capons


Yes my Granado, in this quality: they that come short of my breeding have
don't. The first credit I won was in a Garrison


In Holland.


No; and yet in the low Countries: I never sat foot in a leaguer yet.


The reason of that?


My hard fate nothing else, having as much impudence, and as many ways to
manage it, receiving weekly Corantoes from Paris, Roterdam, and Flushing, and
having trade too in Middleborough, I have been house Lecturer three years
together, and read Aretine, both in print and picture, and that is much for one
of my years


'T may be thou wantst acquaintance.


No such matter, the old Exchange, the new Burse, and new Town, afford plenty;
not a Prentice that can cry Bawd, nor a Butchers Dog that can say bow wow, but
is of my acquaintance


Yet it may be they are precise, and will not be seen in it.


That I know not, but most sure, I have feasted the Liberty twice at mine own
charge, and helped their wives and daughters to the earning of many a fair
pound: they will be seen in that


Well, I am sure I have furnished thy Library with all books of behavior, and
tables of entertainment


And I have culled out all my phrases as curiously and stuck my language with
such enticing conveniences: and for intellicence, all the lawn women, lace
women, box women, and to come nearer to the business, very hair women,
perriwig women, and candied Elicumpany lick halbars, come in twice a week like
decoy Ducks, with whole sholes at the ^aile of them


Why, then there is a fault in your company.


I, I, that villainous company undoes all, There Is Lodowick Tomaso Vallentine,
high talkers, and deep drinkers, but they have wit in their wine, and too much
honesty in their actions at all time, there is only on Gentleman --


Stultissimo of a plain cut and square size, he runs just as you throw him; rub
him a little against the grain now, and he will come off a great deal the
smoother. You would not think, what charitable benefactours three or four
such plush Colonels would be to the founding of a new honor


But have thou such a purpose, indeed?


Why should not I have purpose and effect as much as any: A leager, yes, so it
lay in the I Will of plenty; I Would dig through the Alps with Haniball, and fetch
Theseus from Hell, with Hercules purpose and practice, my precious Monkie, it is
done


And shall I come to the honor to write Mistress of the Leaguer.


Shall not bate an accent of that title my Catamptiall Monky, but you must look
out for Spiders Monky, and the Sprall of all four Puzz: I have laid the
foundation in gold already


Have had a good return of thy Rings chuck?


Rings hangum, they are as stale as Scotch Lanson, Or as your Decoy,

No, I have sent um out in a desperate venture to Cape.

No Monkie, my old friend Franciscus has repaired my Jacket already, and has
promised to new thatch my outside too

One of these boxes has 100 pieces of new gold,

With chains and keys correspondent.


For what use Chick?


For a dead lift Monkie: a Leaguer cannot be planted, manned, victuall'd and
munition'd with a small Magazine: to work Monkie, a mouzing Puss, make choice
of your company, admit no parley with the popular, be high and proud of thy
self, and let those that will needs buy thee, pay soundly for thee with a pox
to um, Puss a wink to the wise, you know my mind, let us have no more midnight
catterwowlings under Sale-mens shop windows, Vintners dark cellers, no Justices
long Entries, but bear up your self so civil and so meager

You may be stilde a sister of the Leaguer.


Away you Rogue.


As I am a Gentleman body and soul I Will break your windows.


Master, as you are a man stand and tickle her.


Will you, you Rascal.


Ah, sweet heart, prithee good woman.


Nay, let her come I Will give her heart belly full.


Let her alone Fub: let her alone, by this hand, I Will make the boys maule her
Ruffs


Fie how I am tired a whoreson stinking shamleg'd, Fie, fie, fie, use a
Gentlewoman thus in her own lodging


How does your back, O the Fucas, out alas, here is half a Crown in Complexion
utterly cast away


If I be not even with the Rutter --


If he come where you have to do, let him pay soundly.


A plague upon his Asses ears, by my Virginity, I Will send his beard into
New Foundland for this


And so I would, to make lines to catch Cods: out, out, out, a Gentleman, and
use a woman no otherwise; in faith, yfath, it stands not with his reputation


A whoreson smelt: Mistress Durable, I would I had some of your aqua vitae, I Am
sick after the conflict


And shall good woman, come, come, pray keep your self warm.


Forsake me honor, when I do forget the bond of friendship, let not poverty,
no, nor your fathers haviour Julio: though our Venetian law proved him a
Traitor: come pluck away your interest from my breast: when we were pupills in
the Academy, I was Franciscus and your fellow then; I am Franciscus and your
fellow still, nor can be altered: I have now a heart as free from pride, as
when I clipped thee thus, before thou knew'st the taste of poverty, or I
prosperity. Think not ancient friend I can forget thee, though thy need were
such as beggary despised


The liberal hand of heaven reward your love, or lend my wishes that ability
to thank you in requital


Amen to that and more.

I tell thee Iulio, I am not happier in my virtuous wife: and yet that is
greater than yielding thee relief it is all that good men wish: Why have we
wealth bestowed on us, but to return the same, where stern necessity pinches
the ribs of him or her that wants? it has no other worth, no more esteem of
me. Heap it together while the, massy weight e'ne crack, what bears it less
than dust? on dust deserves no more regard. I have a Wife, Nurse, and mother,
all she is in one; yet one deserves more Titles, besides her feature, which may
make compare with those that boast of parts: she is so kind, that many
millions may be stamped again, ere one so perfect current. She is worth more
than the earth is: but she is my wife, and I will cease her praise: you know
her father when you have his name: he is called Chrisippus, many style him
good, and wish all Venice such


Ere I was banished for my fathers fact, my knowledge coated, and all Italy,
spoke of a Damsel called Cornelia, this good Chrisippus daughter


She is that jewel, that unmatched, thing I made my boast of: That Cornelia is
none but mine, I dare boldly say, and eke affirm it: See my Julio, she meets
us unexpected, and comes to hinder what I would speak more, in cause of her
demerit, modesty, and sweetness


Franciscus: son!


My Love and duty make me ever such.
To all this company a happy hour.

You have bin mist Franciscus.


You have been mist Cornelia.


Where?


Where ere I have bin, this is my friend, tender him your welcome with as good
respects as I my self where he


Sir, bid your own welcome, and command as much as all we have, were yours.


Your courtesies to one so thronged in misery As my self, dulls my behavior,
that I know not how Enough to laud or thank you


You shall exchange your habit:

Phemone, sister, Anthonio --


We mist you yester night.


I durst not come believe it:
Vallentius for says rowses are too great,
They make me quake to see 'em.
How fares my cosen Lodwick?

He spoyld our sport: he was not well he said:

I would you had been there: Tomaso pledged you twice.


I thank his love.


It is not worth it Sir.


In Faith Nephew I was extreme drunk, ask my man Fub else, he will tell you what
a coil he had with me: the rarest lest in faith: prithee tell 'em how thou
foundst me underneath the stairs


By no means, 'twill make 'em drunk to hear it.


Signior Arbaces you are the man I wished for.


Well met Gentlemen: are you here Antonio?


Cornelia.


Sir.


No, it is no matter. Tomaso you shall do it,
Go see nothing want; you are all my guests, you dine with
Me that is certain: Nay, I will not be denied:
Most welcome Sir to you: will you walk?

Ever, ever welcome.


Will you walk sir? will you munch?


Sirrah Fub, thou would not think how sore my head is, ever since I had the
knock with the Ladle


I believe you: will you feed sir?


No more in the Ladle. Me thinks I am pocky melancholy here of late.


So I ghest, ever since you knew the Gentlewoman that beat you.


Thou say true, ever since in faith.


Why she is able to make any body pocky melancholy. But would you would snap a
bit sir


I love her I cannot tell how: in faith and I were well searched, I think I am
little kin to a Spannell, the more I am beaten, the better I affect


Would I were sure of that.


Well, she shall hear from me in some Sonnet or Ditty; some rare thing of mine
own invention, and that speedily: Let me see to what tune shall I have it


And if you please, let it go to the Punkes delight; it is your only sweet
tune: for women do love the Punks delight


By this hand gramercy; they do indeed, thou can sing if need be.


I can make a scurvy shift: But to say truth I am no good Querister.


But can thou do well and scurvily?


After my manner.


Would I might be hanged presently, but methinkes I am a piece of a Poet
already, there is such a whistling in my pate


That Is nothing but your conceit sir.


Conceit merrily: O that my love were any thing but woman.


O that your love were any thing but Common: then might she be. --


What might she be.


Nay what you will in faith.


I Will to it while it is hot, I know I Am in an excellent vein.


Prick it quickly then:

But Hark you Signior, shall you not need my help?


I defie't, It shall be all mine own, I cannot abide, it is the scurviest thing
to rob others of their wit, good or bad, it shall flow from mine own sweet
brain


I believe you will find the tide turned, it is ebbing water there, would I might
be begged, as he had like to have been, if his foolery do not vex my
discretion, but he gives me means, and I could do little if I could not smile


Well Vallentius, and you be caught in the purlues: and you be not stung for it
I Will forswear privacie, and all that belongs too^^, I have a Girl, the very
spirit of what she was made for, and she were honest, she might crave
supremacy of Hellen, and make her ride behind


And I love one were she not honest, that is her only fault, she were a Paragon
unparalleld, mingle all beauty that our Venice yields, and set her self aside,
she would stand peerlesse, over-shine them all, and dim the Artists cunning


Is she a woman?


Yes, but such a one no voluntary habit, nor sly drift with all accommodations
that beseemes, unblemisht truth it self can bring to speech or give my
thoughts access


What is she for a Saint, that stands in the how fair and beautiful: may one
of my birth entreat her name and knowledge


Vow your assistance to my purposes, and I a Traitor to my self reveal the
treason of my mind


Give me your hand, I am yours for better or worse, in all causes, all
adventures, my sword and self vow fealty: Is she a wife


I, would she were not.


Know you Vanderman our great Physician.


What, my fretfull Doctor? the only curer of mad folks; Know I my self?


You know he is married.


Yes, and what of this (oh would you be ministering therein.) I have you my
dear Flora, well take my word she is thine


I would that I were hers.


Why it lies in thine own choice.


But setting all this pleasantness aside, in earnest Lodowick I affect her so,
no motive mean nor yet dire accident can change my steadfast will, I must enjoy
her, or I must not live


Thou shall enjoy her, or I will not live.


You speak like a friend.


I speak like what I am, a Christian, and by that Epethite, I meant as much as
I speak, nor could I think, Vallentius, you of all the men alive, would have
mistaken me


In any kind but this I never had: pardon me Lodowick this doting loves bears
such a jealous sway, the least suspicion puts us on the wrack, and breaks all
chains of duty: You may persuade me to believe, but yet he that never saw a
Vessel under sail, cannot imagine what the Seaman brooks, the Merchant
sleeping on his downey Cowch, nere dreams what danger the bold Souldie^r dures,
and he that never felt the pangs of Hell, cannot report the torments: assure
thee Lodowick so be satisfied, since I knew her, I have not known my self, so
mighty is loves extremes


It Is strange.


She troth plight was to me, and had been mine, had not desire of pelf altered
her friends, and I dare well vow she loved me once, what ere her mind be now


Come be ruled by me, thou shall set thy toe in the Doctors stirrup, ride and
go a foot at thy pleasure: did she love thee once


I had her oath.


Go to, renew thy suite, the fire is not all out, stir up the ashes, and thou
do not find some embers, that will both glow and warm, pawn me for buttered
Sack, and let me never be worthy redemption


I want the means.


Think not of that, it is here my Flora, what man? he is not the first Doctor has
worn a corner Cap: come, will you be merry Vallentius, and you will forsake not
this mood, I renounce society


I am yours, obedient as your hand.


Follow me then, and I drive not this melancholy fit out of thee, I Will never
trust my conceit: what, ho Damazella? Knocks, and Clarislona looks out at the
window


Whose there?


He Is here that should be here, come down?


Lodowick.


Yes.


What Is she.


The commodity I told you of, there is a Gentleman a friend of yours in love
with her


Not your self.


No faith, though you shall hear her swear as much, it is our rich heir
Signior Stultissimo


What, the Fool?


That mor sell of man's flesh, she cannot beat him away, he haunts the Eves
like a Sparrow in March, you may hunt flies from honey sooner then him out of
her company: now Mistress how stands things with you, when did you play with
your fools babble


You Will never leave this.


Bid my friend welcome.


I thank you Lady.


Come kiss me?


Will you stay all night?


Yes, when I am weary of strength, and foes with my back.


In Faith Lodowick, you must leave this?


So I will*


When?


When thou leave thy trade?


Will you sup here?


Yes drink, nothing else.


Lord, how wise your grown?


So I were, if I could keep out of your company.


Fie, your'e to uncourteous Lodwick: nay, he is ever thus, but it is my fault.


Marry mend it then for shame.


Where Is my Bracelet, which of your Truls has that?


Shall I be true to thee?


Your'e nere true to me.


I mean honest.


I care not for your honesty.


I believe that too, but in plain verity. Your bracelet embraces my horses main.


Come, you jest.


No good troth.


Swear you, I hope you make a difference between your horse and me.


Faith but little: and yet your'e both good bearers.


By the bright Sun you wrong her: weep not fair one.


What, shall we have tricks?


You are too blame beshrow me.


Now, when, what needs all this, nay, and you powt farewell.


As I am a Gentleman you part not so.


Sweet, Lodwick.


Hum, why was not this before, I have seen the Bears.


Do not I know your woman?


Hist, hist, Are you the man of War?


Nay, you must draw nearer, if you will have your Embassy answered: how is it
Mistress Durable


How do you Master Lodowick?


The worse for you, and your creatures.


It Is a good hearing.


Shall I have three or four words in private?


Not with her unless I participate.


What Is the matter?


Yonder Is Fub, the parties man you wot on has something under hand and seal.


For me.


So he gives out.


You may admit him.


Rest you merry Gentlemen.


Whose this secret party, this concealed Champion* What have ye here, Signior
Stuliissimoes man


All hail.


This fellow would keep a vilde coil if he were a top ath' tiles.


Gentiles, good speed.


What, the Plough?


No, you, and you please, Marona to your self.


This fellows discreet.


To me.


So says his backside.


You the man of War, or more properly Pirat, that gave summons to the leaguer.


Leager, Sir.


Leager, Sir, the report of your Pot-guns cannot make us hang up a white flag.


The skirt of a clean smock's more proper ath' two.


We come not to learn what is proper of you, Monkie, and catch flies.


Play at his foolery, come hither Punck.


Sir, you are uncivil, she is none; nor this a Bawdy house; but a Leaguer of
gentle entertainment


The fellow dreams: Come wake and be thy self.


My self? Would you were as sure your selves as I am.


A what?


I Would feign know that of you:
But I advise you to take council of your best judgment first,
Your words will be questioned.

Question that dares, thou art an arrant Cheater.


It Is not your pare royal of plush Coxecombes can secure you in it.


Valiant a the sudden too.


Not suddenly neither:
The growth has both time and sufficient temper.
Why I a Cheater? let any impartial --
Ride Circuit, and sit in judgment of us all,
And show any reason either in Art or Nature,
Why I a Cheater more than any of you.

Thou have nothing but a little wit to live upon.


That Is endowment enough for a Gentleman:
I ever shall count him the nobler gentleman
That makes himself a fortune in the world, than he
That brings it into the world with him.

Suppose this granted: yet why this a Leaguer?


I want words for you: only for conclusion, one out of a strange affected
carriage has gathered an admirable method of drilling, and training men from
the flying of Cranes: Another rare order and government of Commonwealths, from
the poor labor of the Be: And I out of this Leaguer --


Will extract certain ways and carriages for Cheaters and Libertines.


Twere not from my purpose if I granted that to. Lycurgus was the first
Lawmakers; and the best Law that ever he made, was a provision or maintenance
for Cheats, as you call em, and Fellons (viz.) That he (without exception of
age, quality, or condition) which could do the most high dainty, and dangerous
piece of Felony, and come clear off, should be preferred to the most eminent
place of office in the State; but if he failed, he was then to receive Martial
Law


Strange course, pick Officers out of Fellons.


It Is a kind of Meslin or mingled grain still. How much of the poores money
was found in one of the Churchwardens purchase last day


None I think.


How many thieves horses have bin watered at the High Constable of the hundreds
watring trough within this ten years


I think not any.


It may be so: But I am sure, I have heard, or read* or something, that a new
Chief Justice of some place, or a better man would not ha made very nice to bid
a fat purse to breakfast with him if he light upon it soundly: so that it is
not so much the Art to know, as the government to dispose: that quallifies the
man


He says true: all times have bin guilty of good fellowship, why not this? I
like the Leaguer now so well, I care not if I buy a place of command in it my
self


Why now you come to me,
That Is the Pearl I ha^ dived for all this while:
I have a catalogue of names, places, and prizes.
A cup of entertainment for my friend.
Welcome to the new Leaguer.

We Will pledge, we will pledge:
Victual'd and Win'd already?

To the Society at the Swan two pottles and a half: Monkey the health; these
are my noble and prime visi tants; the boxes I gave you to lay up


How now Iulio, gold?


By this light, and the most curious.


A poor Grannams gift gentlemen: 300 pieces, or such a taste, par^ly induction
to a business, or so. There Is a Bordeaux Merchant in Town now, would lay me
between wind and water this twelve month, but the spite is, I am tied not to
part with this gold for ever: if I knew where to borrow but half the worth
on it --


Half the worth?
I Will vow to lend the full worth,
If that will pleasure thee.

You shall keep the gold under lock and key for your pawn.


Thou shall not want for such a courtesy to do thee good: I Am glad thou art so
thriving


Lock up the box, and keep the key; there is the full sum.


To a Piece I assure you: you shall see else again.


No more, no more trouble:
Let me see for how long?

Three Months, not a day longer:
Nay sooner if money chance to come in before:
I have offices in my Leaguer stand upon Fortunes hill.
'Vds me Signior Stultissimo promi^ed
Me a courtesy last night:

Assure thee sweet chuck he will not fail thee.


I believe thee without an oath:
Make my friend welcome to the Leaguer Monkey:
As soon as I have dispatched my voyage
To the Canaries, I am for you again Lads.

Gentlemen, who can read?


Who cannot?


I can resolve you:
She cannot.

What Is here?
Opprobrious Saint, and most Angellicke fiend,
Ere I begin, thus do I make an end.

I should have been sorry else:
Nay silence, or the Proclamation's lost.
And if thy heart be not patcht up in Marble,
Hark how my pen does in thy praises warble.

O dear Apollo, how art thou abused, Is there more?

Sweet stinging Waspe, and well conceited Dove*
For beauty nice, entitled Queen of love
Of me; Sir reverence; that does thee adore;
Which art esteemed a good one and no more:
Let reason rule thy Amazonian sist*
Let ladle rude be thrown at hady wist,
So shall I love thee, take it for no fable
Better then well, and more then I am able.
Yours despite your guts. S. S.

Ass, Ass.


The Authors name.


Cannot you get her Signior Stultissimo?


O, lamentable complaint!


As ever poor man heard.


Will he take no warning.


Is this a Challenge?


Fie no, they are too violent to come in rhyme.


Lodowick, is not this your practice?


Why, do thou think me so simple, so ridiculous.


No, I Will assure you, It Is a token of good will of my Masters, there is no brain
guilty ont but his own: if you like it you may, and you will not, the laws in
your own hands, you may choose


Good Gentlemen return the Carrier.


What? a cuffe or a knock.


He has penned a Song too, which I should have tickled, if I had not been
hoarse with drinking Flap-Dragons last night


What Is thy name?


Fub.


Prithee honest Fub, tickle thy self out of our companies, we will be Fubb'd no
longer


Will not you be Fubb'd Sir.


Thou know my resolution.


Nay, but will ye not indeed?


No faith*


I am glad I know it, -- be with you.


Have you any wine in the house?


Yes dearest.


Come, a pox a these devices, hang off: will you drink Vallentius?


Will I live?


Where Is the Matron?


The Matron, Lord, you're the strangest man. --


Your Matron Grandum, what will you have it, your Bawd?


I must be quiet.


Nay, enter, enter.


The easy time, and such as thrive in it, favor my wishes, the ignorant whose
sole dependence is on verity, and carry conscience in their timorous breasts,
are not associates meet for Iulio. Those that near knew the strain of
Policy, nor aim at more, then what may well content, draw not my length, the
way to prosper, the directest course such are my sore necessities, is to get
liking of this lovely Maid Franciscus sister, bright Phemone, the Virgin's
modest, chaste, and debonaire, besides her brother's rich, there hang my hopes,
but she affects not me, all her desires are on young Anthonios, rich Arbaces
son, my friend (supposed) at least, but that is breath; by what man has, or
can have, he is my foe that hinders my design, where he my next of blood, that
shall he find: the mean to purchase what I reach at now, there is but only
one, one only mean that can supplant him, here it lies shall do it, were he
as dear in estimation as Nisus to Eurialus

I love my self, I count him still most wise,
That cares not who is thrown down so he arise.

THou have to say something, yet nothing I hope trivial, by our known affection
I beseech thee, speak what thou can


I would I had embraced my poverty, while the pale Moon has residence in
heaven, would I had been deaf


Whereto tends this speech if I thought my fault, or any ones pertain'd to me,
through wilful negligence, or otherwise, to breed the occasion of this
passionate mood, I should condemn the cause of the offense, and deem my self
unhappy


Can heaven suffer it?


What, what does heaven suffer, speak my Iulio?


Too much of ill.


Let me know that ill, and I rest satisfied.


Pray no more, the malady is mortal, unsanctified, monstrous. Anthonio is
there such a man


Many that wear that name in Italy: but one amongst that many known to me.


Hate all the name.


Pardon Iulio, I Will hate my self first.


Anthonio is a Villain.


Blot not the reputation of his youth with such calumny, he is no way such,
but as unblemisht, as the snow before it touch the Mountains


He Is a Villain.


Villain never had so fair an outside, nor yet heart so just as that he
carries


He Is a Villain.


I have some business at the Port, you will sup with me to night.


Do you love your self, do you love honor, do you love your wife?


I do.


Then hate that Anthonio.


Give me to understand, since you will force me to endure your report, wherein
he is culpable, or does deserve these ignominious titles


He loves not you.


It Is not my fault.


He wrongs your sister.


Therein, he is too blame.


He loves your wife.


That amends, quits all his former wrongs.


Can you bear it thus, wink Vulcan then,
And let the god of War, throw up her skirts again.

How Is this?


You will not understand; I Will speak no further.


Come, come, my wife is honest.


Yes.


If she be, it is nothing you have said, I Will hear no more; begone.


Will you list a word, Anthonio wongs you.


Wrong me, and if he would he cannot.


He plays the Parasite, the officious Ass to veil his sin.


Would I might understand you?


The Serpent tempts your wife, these ears and eyes can testify; for your
sister, she is stale: his excuse, whereby he cloakes his vice


I wish you Iulio, to know what you speak.


I am not mad, I love you, it is my love, you are my father.


I pray be advised, consider what you do? speak not this no report, be certain;
do not abuse my patience. Tempt my wife, rent earth, and swallow falsehood


Will you be moved Pernassus, the two topt, forked Mount?


My blood is not mine own, I want command of all that now obeyed me, how
different are my fits? I am now a congealed, kneaded cake of ice, bound from
all motion, now again (me thinks) a flaming Island, a Vesunius Hill, merely
combustion


Forget not, sir, your patience.


Tell me of patience when I am my self: how did he tempt her, how did she
accord on thy reputation


I would I had been dumb?


Hang not in the wind, (delay does torture) answer me as how?


Kind, sir, recall your wonted manhood?


Answer me how.


I pray pardon me.


What? strike and cry mercy, I must be resolved, thou have flung me in the fire,
even in the Oven, the mouth of Aetna, nothing thou coulst have said, nothing
have done, could have assured like torture


Would, when I saw him kiss her, crush her hand, wink and laugh out, use his
undecent language: Fie, fie


Cornelia false, the flood may come again, nothing impossible, kiss, and crush
hands, wink, wink heaven and all above


Kind, sir.


Bear witness, all that good are, how dear, how dear, I held that most
false man: set him here, here, even on the spire and pinnacle of my heart; my
life was his, and all that I call mine, but her he has abused


Dear friend, do not forget your name, these are but likelihoods, far from
the thing it self, and say he be a Villain, as no doubt he is little better in
his rude exposures: she may be honest


No Julio, no, had she meant well,
She would have warnd me of his foul attempts,
Said such, and so's his haviour.
When she was loyal, as sure one she was,
(If ever any was) no accident how vain
So e're it seemed, but she a woman, would unfold
Her sex, and say 'twas thus, and thus.

I have stroke him through.


Treble abuse:
Deflowred my wife, abused me,
Disgraced my sister; thrown infamy
On all our heads at once: What beast uncivil bred,
Amongst careless Monsters (but thee Antonio)
Would have been kicked on to that damned enterprise?
That I had patience; me thinks thou should not
Be the Villain yet, report does speak thee.

Nay gentle friend.


It Is true, it is true.
Had any 'twixt the North and Southern Pole
Spoke these words but he, it had not been,
And he had falsely lied.
This is a Creature I have raised, revived,
Snatched from destructions teeth,
Incorporated to me, so dear and just, as not
A thing in all the world can be more truer to it self
And certain: but his modesty conceales it,
Could write a Volume of their loathed designs,
And curse the stories cause. O false Cornelia!

Remember what you are.

Remembrance burst!
There Is no contemplation, nothing what ere can
Drive the thought of shame out of my mind:
Would I had never known discretion,
Could never have made distinctions of persons,
And harmless Creatures; hence forth be ignorance:
Mother of Nations and Understanding perish:
Fair, foul Cornelia. The blue faced
Occan, nor her fertile womb, that yields
Us all increase, nourishes none so false as woman:
Traitors have they been since their first being,
And betrayed poor man e're he beheld himself.
Cornelia can it be thou art a Strumpet?
Oh, oh, fury finish that, burns thee to Cynders.

Work on, work on:
Fate lifts me to the seat of my desires;
And I am prosperous and happy.
This Devil jealousy, my present friend,
Cannot at least but quite supplant Anthonio:
Besides this seeming honesty of mine, begets me good
Opinion of Franscicus, as shall install my wish;
All adds to my avail: what need I curses fear
For the debate my policy shall raise betwixt these Turtles*
I hold with Machievel, for fame or profit
To break oath or league with friend,
Or Brother: there is nothing gainful bad:
I ha my wish, Advancement now
Is what I aim at, present glory here:
He Is true religious, that does nothing fear.

And how? and how?
Was it not patheticall and pretty?

Y faith I never heard the like.

Nor I.

I thank the Muses, I have as sharp a conceit of mine own when I list.


Sir I take you to be a great devourer of Verjuyce.


Now and then; but it is not altogether that; every one has his gift.


It Is so.


Some has two or three.


You say true Signior, some has twenty: for which they may thank impudency and
the art of begging


The art of begging: pray you how long has begging been an art?


Ever since in rid in a foote-cloath, and wore the badge of authority.


How long's that ago?


Ever since you Grannams daughter had a Calfe of your age.


Is It possible?


Yes, and will continue till he is a Bull and horn mad.


Most miraculous: would I were mercinary, and had no more in me than an
ordinary man: Signior, I cry you mercy. How do you since you powered the
pottle of wine in my neck, and threw the pot at my head, because I would not
pay my part o'th shot


Was there such a time?


Was there? Why have you forgot how you kicked me, and I crept under the Table:
I Will be sworn this Hip's as lame ever since, as if I had the Cyatica


Absurd and gross.


We must leave you Signior.


I thank you with all my heart: I am going to the foresaid place: here is my
servant Fub can tell you if I lie in my throat


I will assure you he is wandering to Pusse, or as a man would say, to deal with
Mistress Clariflora


Yes faith am I: she beat me the other day, and I am now going to make her amends.
I think I endure more beating than any three in Venice


Than a Stock Fish.


It Is a sign you are offensive.


So they say that do it. Yester night a scurvy boy did so joule my head and the
wall together, for holding opinion that Cheese was unwholesome


No more good Signior: farewell.


At your service:
Shall we expect you at the old house?

If you please:
Have you heard the like?

These are Asses so tedious --

They Are kin to Burs, they will not off with shaking.
Now my Thomaso what I have to say:
The chief occasion made me summon you,
Is to entreat your knowledge and assistance
In such a project, (as your self set by) and him that must
Partake in the attempt, Venice in Italy
Conceales the man that I durst credit.

Let it not touch confusion of the State,
Treason, and Murder: whatsoever it be,
Command my will and sufferance.

Defend that ever I should be such:
Vallentius never had so foul a thought,
To infect himself, and others.
Thus, in brief, I love a woman; fairer
Than her self never wore the Epethite:
You have seen her sure, and know her:
She Is wife to Vanderman.

Correma's daughter?

That same only wight, is the most precious
Beauty I adore, and would feign call mine own.

Knew you her husband?

By his name, no further;
By that knowledge you understand his course.

Yes he is a Physician: and besides,
What else report speaks of him.

Listen then my purpose,
The severe sir, whose high stretched phrases
Galls the ears of Patience, and wisdom would fain shun,
Bears such a jealous and observant eye
Over the prey I aim at, all conference is debarred,
And you may sooner whisper with the Saint
Argos had charge of, than converse with her,
Unseen, and unsuspected.

Is there no device to compass her?

But one, and this is it;
Your self and Lodwicke (harken I beseech you)
Shall to this skillful Vanderman present me
As one distracted: nay smile anon,
And with a kind of sober modesty, as if you list you can,
Report some probable possibility, how
And which way I got my ecstasy:
Let me alone to make your words seem truth,
And so possess my prating Mountebanke,
That he shall say and swear I Am mad at least.
If not past all recovery.

Will this do?

This, or none.

Then none.
Why this is the shallowest, indirectest course to win a woman that ever was
composed, in my opinion

In your opinion: why sir?

Why, hope you to gain her thus with a mad fit: mark the event, this is a
course as wide: Are you so simple to imagine, she a timorous woman, will endure
your presence, seeming possessed? for shame believe it not, invent some other
means


I verily think so too, but he will never be persuaded.

This were a way to scare her, and to make her shun you.

Leav't off, leav't off, and study some other new passage.

Do, do; this is the grossest: fie Vallentius:

Come, you shall pardon him once: we all miss sometimes.

Good gallants do not ride me, lest I gall you: I Will assure you I trot hard:
why my brace of conceits, my wits; what does your abundance of wit run at
waste: for shame, have you so poor a brain, and you my most exquisite
excellent, for shame take off your spectacles and see better: are you such a
dunce: are you so rare a Coxcombe, to deem I will appear always the same:
are you the men you promised? will you be Masters of your words and oaths,
tender your vowed assistances


I am Lodwicke still.

And I Tomaso.

Continue so: what shall redound upon this adventure, falls upon my head, be it
no shame to yours: only preferment and your smooth apologies


Leave that to us.

But can you act the madman bravely?

Tut, I have played Ajax, and performed the part well, to make boast of
imitation, better than he that Lucian writes of, who so digested what he played,
that he run mad indeed


Can you do it?

So well, as Aesop could discharge his Scene, whereby he won most laud.

This praise were well in me.

Mistrust not my behavior, and if it prove not correspondent to my word,
think me an idle vanter, and no meet associate for you


When put we this in practice?

There Is no deferring weeks, nor days, this hour, this very evening does my
fit begin

Shall we about it then?

What else, what else? Remember gentlemen you fall not upon the scandal of
Ignorance: but in any case keep your countenances


Make no doubt of that.

Come then, and fortune friend us.

Draw your sword.

Against whom?

Against me.

Against any living man that's your enemy:
What ailes my dear Francisco?
By your face you should not be in health.

Draw your sword.

What mean you?

Draw your sword.

Against you never in anger:
Are you well Franciscus? me thinks your cheek
Carries a paler hue than wont to be his Livery.

I must fight with you.

With me.

With thee perfideous monster, with thee thou Judas.

Are you your self?

Thou have abused me, wronged me.

I wronged and abused you?
Franciscus, can you think so of me?

Do not enquire; yonder he sits knows all:
Look yonder, thou art to him transparent, and seen through,
As easy as the air: do not cloak thy vice, do not:
See thou this? see thou the place we tread on?
Mark my speech, one of us twain, or both (never start)
On this cold earth, this very Champion, shall
Offer up a crimson sacrifice of his most precious blood:
For that cause drew I to this silent shade,
Remote from all suspicion, where
Revenge might glut with satisfaction:
Draw thy sword, or else thou never shall.

Did not my love prohibit,
Think, Francisco, I could not be a Coward,
Nor endure the opprobrious taunts the malice
Of your heart has made your tongue throw on me;
Why I know not: believe me, and receive it for a truth,
Were you some other, in this wide vast world,
And not Franciscus, you had been a dog
That I had kicked long since; but you are my friend,
And my disgrace is buried: yet if you carry honor
In your breast, and bear your wonted venerable mind,
Make me to understand from whence, or why your
Comminations and undecent language point thus at me alone?

Will you draw?

Do you thirst for blood? if so, and mine, hide to the hilts your naked
instrument, my bosom is your mark: thrust home and take your fill


Will you draw?

You had mine answer, never* never.

Do you not love my wife?

Yes, by Heaven.

Confess, o impudence! my wrong cries out, no more expostulation, remember
Iulio

Wherefore him, he is a Toad more virulent, oh, oh!

Bathe there, adulterate fiend, and thy red drops wash off thy guilty stains.

Oh, some charitable creaure!
Francisco, dear Francisco.
No pity, no remorse, I bleed, and much effusion robs me of my breath,
something of sense relieve me, help, o help

That dying tune, was sure a man's, where art thou friend, speak thou that
cryd'st for help, if thou would have thy wish, speak once again: where art
thou


Here.

To one in thy case could I nere less wish, then health and mercy, how fare
you sir

Oh! Oh!

His utterance is decayed, and life begins to creep out of his wounds: let me
see, so many, and so mortal! can I but stay the course I wish no more: have I
nothing left, to stay this passage: well, yet still he breathes, that I had
here some help. Thy aid Omnipotent, yet his pulses beat, life is not quite
discharged, -- no succor! keep he but motion, till I can bear him to my Cell,
I doubt not, his recovery: this wind, this wind, that my Balmes were here:
for my youthful days heaven lend ability


Run to all brief confusion.

Good, sir, be pacified.

Even in the pride, and noon time of his fortunes, brought to destruction thus:
a milder, better tempered Gentleman, Venice nor Europe yielded; his knowledge
made me proud, and I was rich in his adoption


O my Franciscus, o my gentle Lord!

My brother, my dear brother.

My son, my son, so noble, valiant, wise, dearer to me then him I call mine
own by true succession, do you weep


I am not blessed, all things do sort contrary; 'twill not do, my projects
thrive not, would I had been silent, we know the first, but not the last, I
begin to perceive our policies of times whets the Axe, cuts off our own necks;
I have and one my self, that it should come to this, we seek to mend so
long, that we mar all: for mine own part, would I could have been content:
but who would have dreamt the course would have proved so violent: well this I
am sure on, I may starve ere I get such another friend


Sister, if it be true, as so the rumor goes, you have played false, and
wronged your dearest friend: you are not worthy such another man, you sole
Queen of Africa; had you to live as many ample years as our first fathers, or
their ages thrice: you might spend all those tedious houses twice told, ere you
find a Mate so worthy, were you equivalent, in birth and beauty, and had no
parallel: Neptunes gems to boot, you want worth and excellency both, to weigh
down his demerit; Virtue and Honor stamped him for their own, at his first
being, and the Graces strove to increase his plenitude. More perfection then he
has, he needs not, where ere he is betook


Something that is mighty, stain me Leopard like, if ere I gave offense.

I should be loath to wish so.

Not you offend? look here,
This letter left he as a testimony,
Who is there here amongst all this company,
That knew Franciscus, knew not he affected,
And highly prized the slain Antonio?
What could have raised such deadly enmity?
But this, but this, thou strumpet,
Between such twinlike friends?
Thy misdemeanour, thy approved falsnesse;
Which too, too well he knew*
Thou have und one him,
Fled he is and gone;
His goods already seized are for the State:
And die he shall if ever he be took,
Oh, fie upon thee my perpetual shame!

Can you this behold, you upright Justices?

Thou art not mine, I here deny thy claim,
And warn thee henceforth,
Come not near my roof:
Pine, starve and die, relief and comfort
Never more expect from him that was thy father.

It Is nothing I see, to work the dissolution of a house,
How easily this is done?

I must weep, to deem
I should be forced to be so cruel;
More I have to say, if tears would let me;
(Me thinks) I could both kiss and curse her:
If she be wronged, and through some make-strife,
These foul ills prove a greater plague,
Then fell in Egypt, light on the Authors head,
The maws of Dogs be his Tomb:
Help me to curse him Iulio.

Ten thousand swords struck me together.

Lived there such a wretch,
And that I knew him,
Let my faith not save me,
But I would tear the Viper with my teeth,
And like a rude and savage Caniball,
Eat out his treacherous heart.

Now the foul Devil, stuff thy glutnous paunch,
I am no viand for thee?

Who Is this comes here, Arbaces?

Disgrace and woe smite all this company, and make them feel my grief.

Disgrace, contagion, and what can be worse,
Smite thee and all thy tribe.

Undone, undone, where is Anthonio?
Where Is my son Crisippus?

Answer thine own words;
Where Is mine Arbaces?

Where such a Villain --
And fell murderer should.

More charity for shame.

Sorrow gripe my heart till it be blood less,
But what thou speak is false:
A more slanderous lie never left the lips of any.

Lie?

Sir, be persuaded.

Tell not me, I Will prove it on him, Arbaces, boy --

That we were alone.

Well said, old Lad.

Show thy self a man, meet me to morrow.

Good, sir, forbear.

Not meet him.

Will you be entreated?

Give me leave.

Will you be pacified?

Meet thee, yes I will meet thee;
I dare meet a man: Arbaces thou shall find it.

Come, you are a prater.

Prate; ye shall hear from me.

With reverence of your age, good sir,
You want of that discretion and stayed judgment;
Your years and place requires: It is not well,
One of your reputation and report,
Should so forget your self: to be plain,
You lack advice; and this same cavillation,
Merely provoked by you.
Proclaymes a loud your inconsiderate folly.

Sir, sir; check your own: --
You never lost a son, and cannot
Aim at my affections and paternall care:
You have undone me --
Robbed me of my joy.

You are not right considerate,
Who has undone you sir?

You, you, and she, and every one of you;
The punishment for murder fall on all your heads,
And blast your terrene hopes:
Cruel, cruel, butchery.
Wast not sufficient that he took his life,
As by his own confession:
Undid his woeful mother and my self,
But he must practice more
Immanly, more dire austerity;
Throwing his breathless trunk
In some obscure night-shaded Mansion,
A prey for ravenous beasts;
Where never eye of creature rational,
Shall more behold him: unchristian part,
If there be justice, above or here;
As certainly there is both: I Will petition,
My loud complaints shall pierce both sides of the globe,
And strike a sorrow in the rudest thing,
Nature for man's use molded:
O! my Antonio? my joy, my life;
My dear, my dear Antonio.

There Is cause for this.

Sure, sure, how fond was I
That could not weigh this before;
Having his proper cause,
If for some not slaughtred,
Nor mine own, but by selection,
I could sigh my age, shed floods of tears,
Meet dangers in my shirt, bid conquering
Death defiance, if all this and more I durst attempt,
For one no otherwise, then mine by law;
Needs must he rave past rules of Manhood,
And forget all precepts that support his suffrance:
See you this? What think you of your self?
Have you not done well? account thou scandal,
That like the Whore of Greece,
Was teemed for man's destruction;
Thy sin upon thy self, my door is shut;
That hospitality I show a stranger,
Shall be restrained from thee.

Most courteous sir, -- expect more.

Keep your Orisons to charm relenting beggars.
Such in need, as may thy wants relieve;
Or at least sympathy thy mournful tale,
When fierce distress smiles,
Expect more comfort from the blustering North,
When he does blow the highest Acorn head
Down to the Meadow, and there dips his cup;
Then least relief from me, for thee;
For thee chaste Maid, all benisons,
And goodness, that I can, command and have.

Your liberality was ever such,
As merits more then thanks; yet thus far,
Truth emboldens me to say you are too cruel kind,
Not all the proofs,
What ere incenst my brother to his rage;
Can wean me to that vain opinion,
To think it her desert: I dare protest for her,
No persuasion can drive belief in me,
To call Antonio false; if you prove so cruel,
So unnatural as you speak, there is no pity in you:
Nor are you such as a father ought to be,
Thrust her out, then turn me off;
If you supplant one, you extirp us both,
And her extremes are mine.

Since you disdain my proffered courtesy,
Together shelter your necessities;
Take up your harbor with the hardy beast;
These gates are locked to her and her relievers
Henceforth I will forget her,
Blot her name forth of the Bed roll
Where my children stand,
And vow I had none such:
Hence, hence, thou scandal.

Thus guilt less ones, suffer the guilties blame,
While they triumph in fraud, thus the strict Judge
Condemns the innocent for the thieves offense;
Whilst partiality allows his wrong,
And greatness makes it good;
Will equity never take place again?
Has trust left swaying here? that I but knew my crime:
Or that Francisco but beheld my heart!
Let mine eyes rain a river of salt drops,
And my tears drown me, if any foul sin of mine,
Deserve Franciscoes hate:
I had rather heaven had made me any thing,
Then one so much unhappy,
When ere thou bidest on the plenteous shore,
Or laboring flood,
Prosperity adhere to thy proceedings,
And fame conclude thy deeds,
For me despised, such be my fortune as my loyalty,
And I request no more,
My sweet, my sweet Francisco.

Heaven do thee right.

And if thou be not honest,
There Is neither pride nor coozenage in this City:
If every conscience were well searched,
And you did not find
Some dainty fine conceited Rogue
Has been tempering,
Let me return to my Cradle,
And be hanged in my swaddling clouts.

THink you it so?


Yes, and verily believe't.


It Is strangly carried.


Mark the end, mark the end;
Why do you sigh, Signior?
Are you troubled with the Crampe?

O, blame him not, he has good cause to sigh,
Francisco set by him precious: How fare you, Signior?

Never worse, my Friend's undone.


I, a mischief and a vengeance oth' cause, by this sword, nay, fear not man,
I am not angry, and I could not judge, well, I say no more: but if he did not
walk on Stilts, I do detest eating and drinking, and those are two
necessaries, a man can hardly live well without them


The very Paragon, mirror of the time.

If I could not have wept when I beheld her, and that was more then I did at
the death of my father, I have no belief in me


Who but she, the wonder of our age.

No more words, mark the end, mark the end; I say, still mark the end.

I must leave you.

Not as the wench left the Frenchman in the suds, there is neither mettle nor
society in thee; if thou abandon'st my company, till we have visited Valentius


I wonder how he speeds?

Did he not act the madman to the life, was it not well? could ever a Dunsticall
Doctor in this Town, have picked falsehood out of his behavior: he was so
mutable, so full of varying tricks (me thinks) I see him yet


Defer your visitation till to morrow, or late sometime to night: I am yet
unfit, this sudden trouble has made me not my self


Nay, you must go; I have sworn you shall, and (that presently.

I pray you pardon me,

I will not be denied, refuse me now and ever.

You Will have your humor still?

What, eschew acquaintanceship? forget, After my most hearty commendations, my
very trusty friend, 'Twere sin and shame Tomaso


But some other time.

This time, sometime, other times, and all times, this day, yesterstay, the other
day, and every day; no hour amiss, march on, march on


I could launch my Dagger through my side, at one easy throw: beggar my
friend; subvert mine own estate, and undo her, by whom I hope to climb,
accursed, brainles slave: could the damned Devil with all his firebrarnds,
beat into my pate no sounder subtilty. I had, I had relief, Fool vaunt of
that?* boast what thou had? or might have? it is past, it is gone, my villain
self, confounded has my self, and him that did sustain me

What choaks Corn sooner than side-fed weeds,
Who ofter does man wrong than he afeeds:
Let me ponder; have I no other invention?
No trick to take away my life, after my means:
Study upon it, I Am struck upon a sand,
Swallowed, devowr'd, through wilful ignorance,
Never to rise again: it is a villains cast,
First to sink others, them himself at last.

You cannot blame me neither:
For love himself undertook more for love;
Had you been tangled in a Labyrinth more intricate
Than held the Minataure, or have been
By Enchantments bound to servitude,
My life's adventure had my love expressed,
And offered the release.

Our plighted amities will dwell in me
While life endures; the many winters, and the tedious hours
We two have spent alone, alone Vallentius,
When nothing but what was not fit the Sun
Should look upon, -- Alack my Husband.

It must not be denied, I Will maintaine't before the Synod, here is my witness:
was it not well done of brave Caligula to make his horse a Senator? deny't,
deny't, would not a good horse show well among a teame of Asses: ha, what
think you: give me another sword: O noble Hector, look, Achilles flies, and
bloody Pyrrhus shrinkes


Alas, alas.

What news, what news?

Gentlemen he takes me for a Carrier:
You are deceived sir, I am not the party.

Will Pluto keep his word, shall all extortioners, engrocers, usurers, be
finely damned, of what kind soever? will he spare none


Wondrously spent.

Let me see, let me see, the son of Panace, a sprightly Lad; Hercules, a
lusty youth, a very lusty youth; Sampson, a tall young man, a very tall young
man


Does he not do it well?

I Will make thee proov't, I Will make thee proov't.

I think you are mad:
What shall I prove?

Why greatest generals, that command whole Legions, and train, and keep in
order every man, cannot keep in a woman


That Is an easy question, because most of them get Follies wings, and grow so
light there is no ho with them: they must fly out


Hang them, they are naught all: Tell not me learned Ovidius Naso, what is your
name

Good sir.

That bloody villain: Treason gentlemen, call up a Guard, the traytor's
discovered: bind him sure, sure: are you took napping sirrah: Down with him,
down with him, down


Help, help, help Gentlemen.

I do not like this.

Now my sweet I have sent him off in post,
Let us retire the while.
Who in affection will not his wits prove,
Was never loyal, nor did ever love.

Past, past cure, I doubt. Give me leave, I find by my Art it is no Vertiga, no
whirling, but a mere settled frenzy: Nay I pray you give me leave: for as both
Hypocrates, and Gallen, Avicen, Podalirius, Rucis, Cornelius, Celsus, Corannus,
Augustino, and Rombart, do you conceive me? besides a dozen or two of
Englishmen, most learned and worthy physicians (if I knew what they were) have
demonstrated paraphrastically, both it and the cause, styling the malady the
digestion of the brain, or Irrevocabilis ignis, the irrevocable fire: Nay,
will you understand me


Would we could.

I pray you give me leave.

Who hinders him?

Sir if you can speak our tongue, I would very feign be beholding to you.

Art thou mad?

Not altogether mad, though I confess I have been pricked with the thorns of
Love: I have been over shoes in my days


Avoydance, for charity avoydance.

Yes marry shall you: I would desire you to help me to a pill, or a potion
that could make one honest, that I doubt is a little gone astray


Avaunt, avaunt.

No sir, she is none of my naunts: she is one that must be my wife.

Turbulant fiend: avaunt, avaunt I charge thee.

I would have it applied sir.

Illiterate dunce, abandon my house, avaunt I say again.

Nay, I pray you be quiet, for though I have endured many hard words at your
hands, I shall hardly brook blows


Good gentlemen give me leave to laugh: ha, ha, ha, the Doctors wife, and the
Madman: the madman, and the Doctors wife


Why, what is the matter?

Why sir, the fits upon him, and he is upon her, and younder's such sport, ha,
ha, ha

Fire and Thunder.

Run: ware horns.

Is this true sirrah?

Follow the Doctor, believe your eyes.

Beware the trap Valentius.

Pray heaven he be not taken with nibbing.

Why are you melancholy Signior?

Faith sir IN me troubled with corns, and ever against rain they make me so
melancholy --

Is that it, for the thing you spoke on, you shall not be beholding to the
scald peremptory Doctor: Come to my Chamber anon, and I Will give you a powder
shall fulfill your request, as well as all the potions or Pills he can devise


Nay, but will you be constant.

Say no more:

And you do take my word, while I live: She and I will be at your service:
when shall I come for it

Any time after noone. Will you walk Tomaso?

This is good news withal my heart: Fub we are all made; thou shall have a
new Livery out of the bargain

I thank you sir, I would I had it.

Thou shall, that's as good: would I were whipped but I could be monstrous merry
now

No I pray you be not monstrous merry till you are married.

I Will go give thee a pottle of Sack.
And ever he gave her a bob,
And ever he gave her a blow:
But where he knocked her once above,
He thumpt her thrice below.
What will it not do? prethee-let's be lusty.

As a Crow in a Gutter. Run there she goes.

Father, for so I must style you,
Your care and pains in my recovery,
Deserves a recompense more than I am able to perform:
Now I consider with my self, had we compassionate souls,
Or were men but good, they would banish beggary
The World quite over, and every one have sufficient.
As hitherto you have conceald my course,
Continue still your wonted secrecy,
Call me your son, and such appoyntments as a father
Should command me to endure I shall perform:
Blessed, blessed be you: effectual be my prayers.

The longer time you so journe here with me
The more welcome: nothing more I crave;
But if I dye while you recide in the grove,
Out of your charity you will take the pains
To lay me in the grave I have prepared, and with your hand,
Your foot, or any thing, cast dust upon my body,
And spend a little Ceremony.

More than this I will, and more than I will speak.
Francisco, whersoe're thou bidest, abide in quiet,
And have my pardon ever. If thou be'st fled
For any cause of mine, and I thy ruin prove,
Defend it heaveu, were it not for trial of Phemone's love,
And promised constancy, how soon would I renounce
My habitatiation, uncloath thy fear, and set all even again?
Nothing 'mazes, nor drives me into that serious
Contemplation, as whence his wrath should proceed.
Perchance Franciscus thinks me unfit to call him brother,
And his sud daine rage proceeded from advice.
If it be so for ever will I keep this shady bower,
And never hold companionship with man,
More than is present, forget Arbaces ever
Called me his, or that I was his son.
Circle me safety, what are these come here
Where never neighbourd welt?

Calamity could not inflict so much as I could bear
With patienee, did Franciscus imagine but the truth:
No lenity, but all extremes that may
Attend me with their sharpest violence,
If e're I broke my vow: this sorrow,
Nor the haviour I sustain are for mine own endurings,
Witness you that know all secrets, it is for him
I wish thrice better than my self.

Yes, and that Cornelia; as sure as the black Ousell
Has a yellow mouth, that whistles me awake.
It Is she, or I am fond.

O my Franciscus! O my dearest Lord!

There needs no more for confirmation:
What make they here? Do not undo me wonder.
Never had two ragged coats more orient pearls,
Than you two shells do hide: it is she, or I am fond,
Leap not forth with joy, such needy robes
Should wrap the shoulders of necessity,
When winter falls the Leaf: happy Antonio,
I am disguised, and so, if that my speech reveal not,
Without suspect I may obtain my wish,
And have all doubts resolved: I Will greet 'em.
Bonny wight, what e're you be,
Luck be in your company:
Are you Sylvanus, say to me?

None such, good Shepherd.

Deft and trim ones mickle glee,
Be you what you please to be,
Some disaster tend by ye,

Never, never more.

A me unfortunate.

Welladay, now by my Creed,
And my merry Oaten Reed,
Sike another rousing sigh
Would well split me gay and blithe:
Let a loutish Clown partake,
Why this sobbing dole you make?

O inconstant world.

A me unfortunate.

Wonderment of woe relate
If simpleness you might not scorn,
How you hapt to be forlorn.

The story would be too tedious for the time,
And would undo the speaker: Friend no more,
You shall do well to leave us.

Be not all too keen, bright star,
If my pertnesse went too far,
Mercy is the doom I sue,
Good things never meant more true,
Than the silly shepherd did,
Late wen he your sorrow bid:
Discourse the means merry Pan,
And the sagest gods do scan;
Wherefore was it? well a near,
You foul mucky cloud I fear
Will be sprint us, Poebus twain,
If so list you but to daine
A poor shepherds entertain,
Welcome should you be, I wisse,
Nor thing comely should you miss,
Though not courtly: answer make,
Will you my small feasting take?

The rain begins to fall;
Sister accept the Shepherds courtesy,
His simpleness cannot but mean well sure.

Even what you please:
Whither I go, or wheresoever I rest,
Sorrow with me, and I with sorrow feast.
Welcome, welcome, welcome still,
Never with a freer will
Was welcome spoken, by the sky;
Welcome, welcome heartily.
Alack, alack, the rotten south
'Gins to open his dewy mouth,
Time to hide you: Father meek
Give kind welcome, I beseeke,
To these white ones, bonny girls,
Welcommer than heaps of Pearls.

You see our Cave, and make as bold as welcome.

Receive my adorations Queen of chance, Thou never gav'st that jewel to that
man, was half so well esteemed; my hopes have their desires, Phemone, blessed
success; nothing that is amiss, but I shall understand: disguise I thank
thee, joy ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak; they part not soon


What Angle of the Earth must be my grave?
The Sea and Sun have bounds, and know their course,
The sons of men have none:
Limitlesse he wanders the foreign deserts,
And begets more wonders every hour:
The Chime that tells the last minuite of the night,
Chides but in vain when every thing's a sleep;
So I in the relation of my woe, when no man hearkens,
Spend but idle breath, and never find relief.
But for increase sake, I could wish devoutly,
I never had known woman:
What comfort ever others reapt from them,
They have been plagues to me: to note the difference,
They are such things, nothing's more worse, nor better;
To say truth, they are Angels, and Devils;
I will not curse 'em, lest I make them worse
That needs no badnesse, nor rip up their defects,
Lest I spend all my after time of life in nothing else but that.
Iulio, the profit of my Orisona be thine,
Where e're I spend 'em, upright constant man:
Yet I am eased, in that I do not bear my slavish yoke,
Cocker mine infamy, as many do within our Venice gates:
Thanks to thee Iulio; Chastity, honor of women,
Whither art thou fled? that they are all so false
I must forget 'em, they will make me mad
To think of their abuse: would I could learn
What inquisition is made after me;
Some speech of my concealment will report blab out,
That I may hear the danger does pursue me,
Though I adventure life, I will know more,
Or dye in the presumption: I Will nearer to the City.

That Is a good jest in faith; Drawer, gives more Wine.

What Is a good jest Signior?

That none should be honest but the valiant.

How Is that? how is that?

Why my beetle-brow'd Host swears it is impossible for any to be honest, that
is not valiant

What said he? What said he?

That none could be honest, that were not valiant.

O very good, very good: more Wine here, he is packing, set out his hand.

And his foot too, ere I have done: where is this fellow? another Pottle sirrah.

Sir I thank you for my powder, it gave her half a dozen of tickling stools,
she has been loose ever since

Give me your hand, here is even now to all the invisible horns in the City.

Forget not the Country, let it go round I pray you.

A health.

You Will have reason to pledge this shortly.

Will you come? to morrow is the day I Will assure you, for better or worse.

To morrow from better to worse?

Yes faith he has said it, and I swear it, from better to worse indeed.

Married to morrow Signior?

You have said we shall be doing.

Undoing he means.

So near marrying Clariflora, and not acquaint your friend? in faith I thought
Mistress you would have let me understood what had past


It Is my part to conceal.

She were no good Bawd else.

Come, sit round, sit round, to morrow the day?

Pardon me, I Will not sit next this lousie fellow: gentlemen, what do you with
this poor rogue in your companies? Does he come to make mirth, can he play
the fool wittingly


I know him not.

Would he were set down stairs, I never could endure him from the first:
Franciscus made me know him

Sir, if you mean to depart in peace, begone suddenly.

Would the Ass could rid this intruding Copesmate.

Let me beseech you.

You shall go, your prayers cannot save you; Fub, show him the way down.

Shall I be your Usher? will you follow your leader sir?

Thus poverty's despised at home, abroad, and in all companies.

A whoreson Tatred-demallion, come amongst Gentlemen of sort. What, is it no more
but up and ride? How now Fub, is he vanished


The Drawers have drawn him out Sir.

Clinke boys.

Drink boys.

And let the Cannikin clinke boys.

Stultus.

Yes Lodwick.

Tomaso, shall's make a night on it mad lads?

And a mad night too Bullies: where shall's strike fail?

The Leaguer, where but a'th' new Leaguer: there is generous entertainment for
Gallants of sort at all times: and for entrance trust me my mates


But money grows low, and expenses will fly high.

Fly hye, let it, I have a jacke in a box shall pay for all one day.

I am as full as a Sponge, I cannot sink up a drop more.

No matter, we can squeeze some more out thus: we can wake the Constable,
trouble the neighbors, disquiet the Master and whole family, spill his Wine,
puff his Tobacco, foul his rooms, practice who shall break most holes, and
cleanliest, in the bottom of quart-pots, with a piece of a Tobacco-pipe: cry
good morrow mine Host, we have made a mad night on it I vow, and so trance; we
are no Gallants and we cannot do this


But this course is either conscionable, or commendable.

Faith it is the course, most of the corke-headed Candle-snuffes walk in these
latter days, late at nights

Well, let them rest: So, ho, the Leaguer.

Chi-va-lah.

Amice.

The word.

Pecima largienda.

Let 'em pass: down with the Percullis:
Lights and attendance, welcome Gentlemen.

I ever said, it might come in a night, that came not in an age, Et ecce noctem
faelicem; see, that joviall night is come: They have been playing high, and
potting deep: Lights, Wine, and more stools for these Gentlemen; welcome


Tomaso when is the day?

Assure's this the night before to morrow, I have brought in my Estate a matter
of 400 pound per annum, in Deeds, Leases, Fee-simple, and Coppy-hold already:
and that is no simple Estate you will say: I mean to bid you welcome to a Leaguer
of mine own shortly Gentlemen; some wine you Scondrils


I Am pleased to here't, whose faults this, yours Tomaso?

What Is this Leaguer raised yet, Par la ho boy, I thought we should have had a
second siege of Troy on it, is their Reckoning paid? not a penny, they called
for one, but in such a drunken key; I bad em sleep upon it, and I would tell em
more on it when they were sober


Best of all, and what is to pay then?

Nine and six pence, Sir, allowance for lights, linen, coals to light faggots:
and six pence for one journymans sleep only deducted, and yet they grumbled too


But nine and six pence, and grumble; my friend the reckoning's not paid you
say

Not a penny.

The reckoning but nine and six pence, how poorly this shows, in a Leaguer
too, and friends that pretended me a courtesy too? How many joints of meat to
supper


Only a couple of clean Pipes, some three times filled I think.

No meat, come to hansell a Leaguer, what no meat? Are they abed at Anthonies
Ordinary yet

Two hours ago.

Step down, and see, nine and six pence, they must and shall hear more of
this: we may go beg, or buy up all the, refuse, broken bread and meat, scraps,
offall, and garbage that Cooks shops, Shambles, Ordinaries, Entries, and
Richmens doors afford; nine and six pence, if they do not hear more of this --


It Is past that time of night; Charitie's bed, sir, but if not. --

Bread and meat for poor prisoners, Bread and meat.

What does that fellow cry?

Bread and meat for the poor prisoners, bread and meat.

For poor prisoners? as fit for my purpose, as a Conny for a Pursnet; here,
take money, buy his provision by the lump: if I had studied for a fortune to
fall upon me, I could not have had a fairer


Will thou victual thy Leager with scraps, sweet Chuck?

No, my sweet Monkie, I have further aims then so, this broken meat and
baggage offall, will I strew in my Kitchen, Dressers, Hall, Entries, and every
door and drawwindow, and perspicous places about the house: foul all the
vessel, three or four times over, all to besmeere the rustie spits and
dripping-pans; break all my broken glasses, beat the bottom out of my Cans:
beat all my foul Tobacco-pipes, into fraction


And to what end all this?

Perlahay, My friends shall hear more of that in the reckoning: My sweet
Monkie, when the Drunkards shall wake, and see all these ruins, or rather
remayns of a plentiful Leager: Oh, have thou no apprehension? Why, I tell
thee, they cannot choose out of their generous bounties, but see all discharged

Within. A cup of six, Drawer.

Oh, the Leager begins to rise! Come Monkie a few directions for you in
private, give you attendance on the Leager; let em call for what they will, and
want nothing they call for: only I will tell em no more of nine and six pence
in the reckoning


But for the nine and six pence.

Monkie, you shall hear more of that anon, when they are sober? why Drawer,
Dog, Dunghil-raker; is the Leaguer dry? By and by, a cup of six into the low
Leaguer, there


So, ho, the Leaguer.

What do ye lack? by and by, do ye call Gentlemen?

No, and I called a Gentleman, he would answer me, I call a Drawer goodman
Rascal, art thou one

For fault of a better, sir.

Could not ha said so then? where is the Master of the Leaguet?

Parlahey Monkie, been venu Gallants, com a stato Sigiores mio com I stato.

Marry the better for your entertainment; thanks, sir.

Thank him, I scorn to thank him, I Will pay him, and be out of his debt: come, to
pay? A reckoning Drawer

You Rascal, who takes away here? here is a house bestrewed with garbage and
offall, as if the great Inquest had been feasted, etc


As good men, to no man's disprayse be it spoken, where is a Bill?

Prithee knock us not down, before our time; was this certain feast of our
making? what a spoil of Poultery has here been? Tom^so, I must be beholding to
thee for this ordinary


Some small trifle Stultissimo, the Reckoning is thought to be.

The Reckoning's very high, nine pound six shillings.

Nine pound six shillings, Parlahey, and yet I use you like Christians too
boys

Nine pound six shillings, how could we four devour so much being half
drunk when we came in

Why there is the mystery? you fall asleep with meat in your mouths, my Mistress
and I stood it out

Wast not an excellent Swan-pie? Servant.

As ere swam in Mil-dam.

Nine pound six shillings, one lay out for all,
Come, your purses Gentlemen.

And you love me, let me have the credit at this time there is: ten pounds, give
me the rest again (ah, we had the bravest Marchpane, and Sugar Candy Custard)
or do not, let it run on toward fouling of linen, and paying for sawee: the
rest again, or do --


I do not think but you are sawst pretty well already, for the Devil a bit of
meat saw I, and yet all these scraps could not come of nothing


The Reckoning's paid to a hair, come let us withdraw (but while the Room be a
little finificald

Parlahey, welcome Gallants to the Leaguer still: please you withdraw.

We accept it thankfully.

Whose fault's this yours Tomaso?

There wants lap.

Throw down the pottle pot, let us have a gallon more.

Wilt please you Gentlemen, to hear any Music* and a good Song?

Very fain, a good one.

What Is your fellows, whose noise are you?

Ruberts noise, and please you?

Call your fellows, and strip your tools.

Here Is to you Signior.

A brace of them if you love me.

Marry and shall.

Score a gallon of Claret in the Pomegranat.

What Tim?

Master Fub I rejoice to see you well.

You are not merry Gentlewomen, Mistress Durable what, no mirth?

And how is it, how have you done this seven years, welcome again.

As you see, in perfect memory, when shall we ride the hogsheads?

Ha, do you remember that night, Ancient Thumps health overthrew me, my Master
goes out of Town next week; in faith and you will come, there is half a dozen good
boys, we will be swingeing merry, will give him a crash, old Will, Will be here


What Will?

Little Will of the Mitre. Oh, Master Fub, Sir, out Maid, that gave us the
Neats Tongue is gone

See, see.

Some Sugar there?

Ha, ha, hum.

In ample stories written it is,
Who list but for to mind it;
How loved Narcissus?
Go look and you shall find it.
This Echo was a Nymph most chaste,
A lack, the more the pity*
She should be so, and should not reap*
What follows in my Ditty?
Narcissus was but young, I wisse,
But yet of perfect feature,
And had enough to satisfy
A reasonable creature.
His brawny limbs became his parts,
No one of sense could blame them:
And so did something else I trow,
Echo knew how to name them.

A virtuous piece of matter, Gentlemen, we will no more on it.

Nay, hold up, Signior.

Bid her hold up, fear not me.

Come Gentlewomen, shall we have a dance? Tomaso what say you?

You prevented me.

I thought it should have been my motion?

Wherefore ring those bells?

Bells, you are deceived, it is the clincking of pots.

I would have sworn, it had been Coronation day.
Masters, can you play us Gascoynes Whibling?

Yes, sir.

Let Us have it.

Here lacks a couple, we cannot dance it.

Lack a couple, what serve Tim and I for?

It Is true, well remembered.

Truly, Master Fub, I cannot dance.

Truly, you shall learn then.

I shall be willing to endeavor.

Strike.

I Will throw the pot at his head that strikes here,
Whose that will strike?

Rare in faith, give's more wine.

What, Timothy?

By and by.

Look to the Lion.

I Will have my Galliard too

You spoil all.

How does your head, sweet heart?

Yes faith, and thank you too, what Rogue's he that turns the Room round? shall
we not quench our thirsts before we part


What else my sweet Signior, this is your servant?

Good enough for a property, he will serve my turn, as well as a better, I
shall but use his name: do you think I would marry the Coxcombe, but only for
color and fear of the Law? I Would see him baked first


It Is wisely done of you? and so my Gossip Slight could say I warrant you.

Boy, another quart, and bring a Reckoning. Here sir.

Heaven keep your Worship.

In honester company.

Fub, call for a Looking-glass.

Did you go the right way?

It Is a cup of neat wine, I Will assure --

Mistress to your self, and to our next meeting?

What Is to pay?

Nine and six pence, and you're welcome.

How comes that to pass?

Here Is seven groats Glasses.

How?

No less, I Will assure your Worship.

Come your money, Signior --

Fub, discharge it Fub.

Some lights, show the Gentlemen.

Fub, I am ene as full as a Toad.

Yes, sir, but do not spit your venom.

Prithee give me another sip. I am as dry as a Cook.

So I think.

A pox a this Megrum.

What Is here, I prithee mark Tomaso: Lodwick, I have my desire: fetch me off
speedily, lest I cure the Doctor? yours Vallentius, lest I cure the Doctor


What should he mean by this?

Why, belike he has infused his fit into him, and the Physician's turned
Patient

That Is impossible?

But for Vallentius.

We must redeem him.

What else.

Heyda, is the wind in that door?

A link good Tim, a link.

Here Is one ready, sir.

Signior, good night.

Not a drop more in faith.

We Will take our leaves.

When shall we see you?

Sometime to morrow, if my father send not.

Good night Master Lodwick, good night good, sir.

Good night Tim, remember Friday.

I warrant you, forget not to bring Hugh, Welcome Gentlemen.

I Speak't in thunder once again, no more: thou Babylonian Strumpet, in thunder
I command thee thou lump of sin, no more


Have patience, sir.

I rore it in thy ears, once more aloud, no more: cannot I deal, but you must
be applying, you must be tampering, you must minister: have you not Pills for
Potions? do you not traffic? do not you exchange Merchant


Good Vanderman.

Sorceresse, I defy thee, and thy deeds of darkness.

Hear me, sir.

I have heard and seen too much, has he not paid you soundly for your pains:
no, has he popt you


You are deceived.


You say very true, I am deceived indeed, and Fub'd, and Guld, and Rid, and you
are Rid too

What mean you?

Here blow it abroad, there is horns enough to do it.

Why are you thus impatient?

Dainty fine y faith, very dainty. Whore thou have made me monstrous, and I may
challenge Giants: Yes, he shall be your madman; Do you not like his fits, do
you not, do you not


God morrow to you both.

Why should this be?

How do you sir? how does your patient?

Are you not satisfied? am I a stale? must you have newfound Crochets?

Do you hear me sir: is he recovered*

Homo Armatus, a man armed.

Have you heard the like?

Me thinks it is excellent.

And when, when shall he plant again?

I wish you would understand me, sir.

Here Is a fruitful soil.

Ha, ha.

Sir, I will be heard, and understood:
Save you Lady:

More furies, might, and secrecy, whoredom and The every bring all to
confusion

Would we had more of this: we will see what will come of all.

I perceive Vallentius was in the right, he is mad indeed:

Good Morrow Gentlemen: I have good news for you; your friend is well.

Your tidings makes us happy, and gives us a moyetie of that content which
nothing can do more

I shall rejoice to see him what he was, and Master of that temper he
commanded, when he did dare the vaunting Bajeset for taxing his belief


Tomaso, Lodwick.

Valentius.

I am glad to see you once again your self.

You're welcome to your wits.

When time and place shall serve, my wit shall thank you I am ever bound to
you sweet Lady

Hark you Lodwick, are not we partly Bawds?

Faith in one kind, we have a snatch that way.

So I say partly.

I must confess, partly.

Not remember you, have not that bad opinion, do not think I can be one so
false by this kiss

Sibylla.

Ay me, my husband.

Once again and part.

Sibylla.

Farewell, Valentius.

A thousand take with thee.

What, hungry still Vallentius, that you cast such a greedy eye that way?

How is it man? what in a trance?

And kinder far then fair.

What, shall we have a Pamphlet; that he begins to study? do you hear
Valentiuss: here is a friend of yours would speak with you, when you are at
leisure


I crave your pardon Gentlemen, as I live she is --

What Is this to the purpose?

You know my price: for the finenesse of the silk, the working of the stuff,
and the pleasantness of the color, the whole street shall not afford you a
better, I Will assure you it is died in grain


The better for him that shall wear it, nothing but what is in grain can please
him: let me see, I know not how my money will reach: the Silkman has emptied
my pocket this morning, but you will bate nothing of your price


I protest sir, I cannot, and save by it, and I know you would not wish me to
be a loser

By no means, I would have every man to live and thrive by what he professes,
it is mine own case: let me see, I cannot make up the sum, I pray you let one
of your men step over to the next lane: I lie there at the Barbers, I Will
dispatch him presently


My servants are all busy for the present, you see my shop is full of
Customers, and every one striveth who shall be first served


And I am in haste too, for I have sent for my Tailor to meet me at my lodging,
and I am loath to disappoint him, because I would have his opinion in the stuff


I pray you, sir, be expeditious, and my man shall be with you by that time you
have told out the money

I am much obliged to you as a stranger, I care not if I accept --

Dispatch me that Customer quickly, and follow this Gentleman to his lodging:
you hear where he lies

Yes, at the next turning?

I Will but fold up this boult of Satin, and be with him instantly.

Turn by the next lane, and thou shall be sure not to miss it, though thou
find not me, I have took sufficient order and you shall be sure to be
satisfied


We have many cheapners, but few buyers, many such customers as this would make
quick riddance

What comes the sum to, sir.

Three yards of Satin and a half at seventeene, eight yards of Plush at four
and twenty; nay, there are diverse other parcels, the sum is soon cast up:
thou shall have a note of all


And I Will but fold up these few boults lie loose, and clear the counter and be
gone

Be quick there.

But thou must be secret.

As your self, Sir.

A pretty handsome youth, and will be loath to discover himself, being
extremely bashful, and will make it strange

Leave him to me, I Will persuade him that I knew him, ere I saw him.

He Is my Kinsman, next Cousin German's by the Mothers side; now playing the
Wag, as many youths will do, you know it Barber


Very well, it has been many a good man's case.

He has got a clap.

These claps are got by clapping.

But for one thing, never should it grieve me, I fear it might go nere to
spoil his marriage, which I would not for more than I Will speak


You show your self a Kinsman.

Now his exuse will be (as I told thee he is extremely bashful) to enquire for
a Gentleman that owes his Master money, to comply with the old Proverb, Though
his excuse be draff, yet drinks his errand


And lotion must be used.

As it shall seem best: but think thou he will endure it.

'Twill put him to some pain.

Which I Will not hear, my heart's so tender ore him: when he comes (as long he
will not stay) take him in charge, Thy pains shall be well paid, for doubt not
but I Will come to the conclusion


Very good, sir?

My hope is it will succeed according to my wishes.

Make no doubt of that, sir.

If I had, I had not made choice of thee above any other.

You are my friend indeed: and so I hope to keep you.

I will withdraw for the present, and instantly return.

Now good speed with you, good customers are thick sowed, and come up but
thin. It is good to make much of them, when we have them. This should be the
patient, that he talked off


I come to seek a Gentleman.

You do: that owes your Masters money.

Very true, sir, you know my errand then.

Before you came.

The Gentleman belike has told it you.

He has indeed.

Is he within?

But before he went, left order with me, you should be dispatched.

Then I shall find him as good as his word: he has acquainted you with my
occasions

I Will assure you that, and intends well toward you, I pray come near into the
withdrawing Room

I Will wait on you, pray know you what it comes too.

Yes youth, I know, wherefore you come: pray rest you in that chair, and I Will be
for you presently; be not ashamed, you are not the first, nor shall be the
last, that meet with these disasters: and now come, pray show me your commodity


The commodity belongs, sir, to my Master, 'twas not mine.

Are his in danger too? let him not fear, but if he have not let it run too
far, there may be help found: nay, come, will you show


Mean you the note: there are the parcels sent.

These parcels may in time grow great, come, will you be ruled, the Gentleman
your Kinsman, told me before, how bashful you would be; and it becomes you
well: but for your parcels, show them in time: for if delay be long, that
little which perhaps you shall have left, in time will come to nothing: your
Kinsman's loath that you should spoil your Marriage


Spoil my Marriage, spoil not my Masters debt, Neither draw these fearful
tricks on me: I need them not, pay me the money that your friend has left,
Dispatch me so, for Kinsman I have none; And honest Barber find some else to
sport with, make me none of your Guls


But I pray say.

I say, pay me sir, what is my due, and what by your confession, your friend
left, or bring me to the party, or commodity he late had of my Master, or Coin
for it: you have confessed him to be your friend, therefore for him must answer


By your favor, no more friend of mine, then you found him, to claim Kindred:
my acquaintance with him, yet is scarce a full hour


You are Confederates, and so I fear that I shall find you: You know my
errand, and promised me dispatch: Why am I not dispatched then


My meaning was to give you a Sering, or an incision Knife, Of which he told me
you did stand in need: Indeed I deal in such commodities, And am acquainted
what such parcels mean: For other wares or money due for them, I know not what
belongs to it


Satisfy my Master so, quit me, and clear thy self; or 'twill fall foul upon
thee

Willingly: my cloak boy, I Will along, yet am afraid That he who had professed
himself thy Kinsman, and my dear friend, will prove thy Masters Cousin


Give you joy Master Stultissimo; give you joy.

You talk like Gentlemen, and I like your talk the better, because you talk to
a Gentlemen; you call me Stultissimo, and I say, Stultorum plena sunt omnia:
and now I talk to you like a Gentleman and a Scholar


All health and joy betyde you.

Gramercy Gentlemen, I am not now the man, I was in the morning; I did rise
single, I return double: in the Meridian but Worshipful, in the afternoon
Honorable before Sunset, and who knows but Majesticall before midnight: nay I
persuade my self I am so: am I not sweet Monkie


Thou art my dear Baboon.

Very pretty names in faith: I prithee let us enterchange them still betwixt us:
or Marmoset, or Apes face

Yes, yes, by any means.

All thy goods and chattels, thy movables, and the stuff that belongs thereto,
thy utensils and implements; now are all mine


They are, to have and to hold.

Yes, as long as ye can keep them.

I have purchased thee in thy proper person by my word, but all thy other
omnium gathrum, beforenamed, by my deeds, I think thou have them to show


The mind gives sometimes words unto the tongue, and makes it speak perforce,
bear with him Lodwick

Let the Doctors wife bear with him, for mine own part, without he renounce
this mood, and become sociable, as he had wont, I defy his fellowship


Will you dine with me Vallentius?

Yes, shall we be merry?

O is the tide turned, is the wind come about, by this good day, and I were
not cursing my self, for being accessory to this melancholy, I have no faith
in me; if women can transmute men thus suddenly, hang me, if I keep not out of
their clutches


Gallants, shall we walk? I have a story for ye: prithee Lodwick frown not, be
a friend indeed, and see not my defects, I have a tale shall make you laugh
anon, and will excuse my blame; prithee be thy self, be jocund man


Nay, I am soon persuaded.

Where shall we be?

At the old house.

Come then, I Will make you laugh I swear.

Thus by degrees, with hazard of my life, have I attained unto my wishes rest;
and boldly gaze thee Venice in the face: the time has been, Oh, but that time
is past, when I was more familiar with thy pomp, but all that bliss is gone:
And murder now, has with a crimson stain sealed me accursed, and like a
condemned guilty Fugitive; I wander in despair; fearing the ru^^le of the
harmless bird, and the flies clamor, the Ant, the Waspe, and every lesser
thing, Dreadlesse of danger, strayes abroad for food; Not caring who behold
them, But I, alas, of all; am most unhappy: Would I were dead, and past the
fear of that, Makes me thus Cowish. Who art thou comm'st here, more needy
then my self


Where might I run to meet destruction, And set a period on my wretchedness?
Stern misery I know, and feel thee now: Yet is the earth content to bear my
weight, And suffer what proud man disdains to know, Unless to spit upon, or
add to that, Which wants no extreme


I cannot hold: his voice, his humor, I dare swear as much, it is he; It Is he
by heaven, my Iulio

Franciscus, preserver of my life; O let me kiss the ground whereon thou
treadest, then rise to thank thee

That I could spend my self to tears for joy, bear witness you that know it:
Iulio, for ever dwell within these arms of mine, thou truest among men, I have
not power to question thee, my danger, my joy is so excessive; run all to
spoil, and terror meet with terror; I fear none my Julio


Strike when thou will proud death, I dare thee now; For having what I wished, I
wish no more, nor would entreat time to defer a minuite to have him rest an
age, since all things must have end, end it at once, my prayer is confirmed, I
have seen you e're I die


And if you love me wish me not that wrong by praying for your end: do not
quite undo me, if you but knew my heart, my Julio, you would not crav't
again: I could have comfort now, and clean forget the dangers I have past,
and those pursue me still: nothing to come can half so much dismay, as thou
do comfort; be it sudden death or torture worse than it: but for your sake,
would in my womb I had bin strangled, and never drawn this air


Where art thou Conscience? whither have thou took Since thou did leave man's
breast? that we should all have mothers; Wisdom all, yet all contemn her
precepts: when you first fled, and by command'ment from the Senate house, your
ships and lands were siez'd on for the State, those that which staid them did
appear so near, as if their blood had tied them to your service, grew so
forgetful in a moments space, that neither argument, nor extreme signs could
win them to belief there had been such, as what you were to them: I (as no
less I could) bound to it by duty, spoke your merits still, and did maintain
your right, on the Allies of your inconstant wife: but I am poor for it, truth
was still despised, and less I could not be


Take all I have* had I my former wealth,
My bounty could not recompense thy worth,
And power it all before thee (my dear Iulio:)
Be not impatient with thy sufferance, he is above will pay thee all
My debts, though I should perish now.
Contemned for me? alack, alack, if there be such
A thing in Charity, be charitable: do not curse the cause
Of this thy present want, I do beseech thee do not thou Iulio?
I prithee answer me, and either do what I have wished,
Or cure the wound thou have made.

Good sir no more: do not call all the tears out of mine eyes; think who I
am: would you did but know

I will not urge thee further:
Shall we here combine, and shape our course alike,
And never, never part; yet pardon me,
I will not wish thee so much injury
To be unknown of woman.

You wish me not so well, how e're you wish, if you wish otherwise: your misery
be mine, and my enduring yours; one grave receive our bones; and he that says
this Sepulcher is mine, call it Francisco's Tomb


I have a habit for thee yet unknown, or worn,
But by my self: it is not a Furlong from the Antique Beech,
Whose hollow sides conceales it: bide but here,
Till I can reach it from the hidden place,
And take it for thine own: though homely,
Yet the coursenesse will keep warm,
And ward the sharpest blast.

You bind me to my prayers.

I Will be with thee straight.

Ignorant honesty, shallow Italian, yes, live a wretch: Can thou be so fond
to think me of that mettle? have thou eyes, and may, yet will not see how
thou art o're-recht: yes, do continue innocent, do, and die a fool, my
friend, my friend, my very loyal friend, all friendship I forswear, save
outward signs, which with my garment J cast nightly off. The father of the
slain Antonio promises liberally by Proclamation to any that can bring
Francisco forth. I will betray him, I will be the man shall purchase the
reward: What way I curses, or care for the report the multitude shall clamor
therein. I Will imitate the Lawyer, making bad words my gain. Franciscus thou
wast born for my advancement: he is sunk himself, and fruitless is the hope
depends on that which was, and not which is; give me the present, not precedent
man. Let me not hanker for emergency, but take the instant sway, the published
recompense is mine, it is said, it is mine


That any should be false -- But were there no dross, gold could not be
esteemed, nor nothing precious rare. Cornelia let me forget that name and
nothing else


It is a month and more since she left Venice.

Would I had left the world when I first saw her.

And the same minuite did Phemone forsake her friends and kindred: but where or
whither they have betook themselves the most knowing but conjecture


How easy could we make our miseries, if we might live and dye when it
pleased our selves

These strange additions to my news I add, Antonio's Carcass never could be
found since yours and his contention

I left him dead: thou art still just; some beast has made that fouler beast
his prey, and made up my revenge: but come with me, let us withdraw unto you
thicket by, and speak at large that woeful history commixt of my proceedings,
and pursuith; wilst time's our own


I would provide me of some necessaries, small in expense, which make a mighty
miss, and health cries out to have: so if you please but let me fit my present
want, at my return enjoyne me to your will, though it continue to the latest
date, and I am serviceable


Speak no more such words, but make your own content: yet good Iulio be not
absent long, make me not long to see thee


Such shall be my speed, you will not wish me sooner to return.

Not wish thee? yes, though thou should make return e're thou depart.

Mark the end.

Be brief, and goodness take with thee. This Iulio, if desert might purchase
Fame, deserves sufficient: but thou art partial Fortune in cramming Buzzards,
whilst the Eagle sterves: How many in this fertile Italy, whom Nature molded
when she loathed her task, and blew her seed among the ignorant, have thou
adorned with plenty? whilst seemly virtue, wrackt with poverty, jets under
base control: There Is no felicity, nor true content here upon earth: The
Spider builds his Web in Barnes and Palaces: and the Prince himself tastes
gall as honey: Happiness there is none, for least or greatest: Here my grief so
parches me, that it does pain me to relate my woes, and make my feelings
known. Beneath this Hill a clear and pleasant fountain curles along, whose
shallowness makes the small pibbles 'peare above like Rocks, and murmr as
she runs down to the silver Current, thither will I high, and borrow so
much of her watery store, as will assuage my thirst

All things are kind,
And feed our wants when they themselves are pined.

Now my Catter-whauling Pusse, how did thou like my last Cheat? did I not
fool them finely

Thou art the very mere Mephostophelus, and I persuade my self thou have new
vampt thy wits

Tush these are nothing: I have cheated one of the bravest Stats-men of the
world; the very quintessence of Spain: Nay, I have fooled him who boasted in
his Country, he had guld all our Nation A Guelding is not rid in the
horse-faire, but he is mine to ride, maugre his Masters teeth. I have
out-fac'd a fellow of his horse in the open Market, sold him before his face;
and but making a question whether he trots or ambles, ride away both with the
horse and money, my Pusse. Sweet Munkey look to the house at home, I must
abroad again, to fetch in a new purchase


May thou thrive according to thy will, and to my wishes.

And what is your Action?

Three hundred pound: be you ready to snappe him, and not to escape you
without good bail: he is as slippery as an Eele


Therefore we will take him by the shoulder, and not by the tail; and so we
shall be sure to hold him. But can you show us the man


This is his walk, and without waiting long you may spy him.

Say but that is he, and it is enough.

Stand as close as you can: If he have but the least suspicion of an arrest,
he is gone in a twinkling

But will not you stay and assist us?

By no meunes; I Will but see him in hucksters handling, and be gone. Are you not
paid your Fees aforehand, and -- That Is he now: Now let him escape upon your
own perrill. Farewell


If he do, say no more: Yeo man stand to me.

Now let me see: whom shall I next encounter?

Marry the Counter sir: for we arrest you.

Ha, Counterfeits so nigh?

Yet current enough to carry you to prison.

And yet your Counter-tenour sounds but like scurvy Music: am I caught then?
I pray you at whose fuite

At three men's suite.

Then three merry men, and three merry men be we, are we not honest Sergeants?
well, there is a piece to begin withal: lets talk further of the business


You speak well sir, if you hold on as you begin: and if you can find good
bail, ten to one but we shall prove as you late called us (Honest Sergeants.


Me thinks you do not speak like Varlets:

May it please you, sir, to employ mine industry For any further service?

Something more,
Which in my former Letter I forgot,
I would entreat you bear in memory:
And that is but this --

And in good time: Know you that reverend man?

Know him sir, yes, for a worthy Doctor.

He Is mine own Uncle: will you take his word.
And make it to me as a free discharge?
If he but say (nay there is another piece)
I Will see you satisfied?

Yes could we hear him say so: for he is one whose word will not be questioned.

It Is enough:
Give me but so much leave as speak unto him,
All I Will keep in fair distance: on my life,
If he ^ay not I Will see you satisfied,
I will return your prisoner.

It Is enough: for so far we dare trust you: you have paid for it well: but we
will watch him at an inch

I know he will not suffer me to lie
For such a petty sum: Now brain or never.
Excuse my boldness Sir: though it be scarce manners,
To interrupt your serious conference.

With me sir is your business?

Such a business,
Which as it touches me in Charity,
So should it you in Conscience.

Speak it pray.

Look well on these two men.

He points at us.

The one is an arch Brownist, and the other
Cannot endure to see a Surplesse worn:
Subject indeed to no conformity;
Yet both so well persuaded of your learning,
And spotless life, that what you shall propose
They Are willing to subscribe too.

I am as ready to give them my instructions.

And please you say so, that they may hear you sir.

Well I will:
My honest friends, and please you to have the patience
Till I have ended with this gentleman,
And instantly I Will see you satisfied.

It is enough grave sir.

Now honest Sergeants: what desire you more?

Nothing from you sir.

I hope so honest Sergeant: you see I deal fairly.
Farewell my honest Sergeants.

I have told you all: only remember me to these my noble friends.

With all the art
My weak tongue can deliver.

So, he is now at leisure.

And now I come to you.

Most welcome, sir, we stay for the same purpose.

Now, tell me briefly, which of you is the Brownist?
which the other, cannot endure a Surplice?

You are pleasant, sir,
We wait here, hoping to be satisfied.

And to that end I stay, for these opinions
So erroneons and so gross.

Sir, all the opinion that we hold is that you will pay us the money.

Still obstinate in error; it is this money,
And worldly care on which so much you doat:
Breeds in you these distractions.

Please you to pay the money, you shall find us conformable in all things.

Money my friends, are not you Sectaries?

Sectaries; no, sir, we are Sergeants.

Sergeants; and wait for me? I owe you money?

Yes, sir, for your Nephew that was with you but now, and told you of it; and
we heard you say, you would see us satisfied

The man's to me a stranger I protest,
And his request was I should satisfy you
In some points of Religion.

Religion, sir, it is a theme we seldom think of,
But three hundred pound is money.

But I tell you,
I past my word for counsel not for coin,
And this is all that you from me can have:
Endure a Surplice, and beware a Knave.

Had we not warning sufficient of this before?

Well, howsoever, we have had good counsel,
If we had the grace to follow it.

ASsure me of the promised recompense, I Will bring you to his presence.

Hear me a word.

Now Signior, how do you feel you self? How like you marriage?

Faith it is a pretty quaint thing, and there is much good sport belongs to it,
would I were unmarried again

Why? are you weary of Clariflora already?

Weary no, but I would have store.

Hark you, sir, take my counsel; though store be no sore, meddle with no more
of them, lest you make me a Prophet, and get many a sore head by the match:
have you not heard the ancient saying, No man can serve two masters


That Is true, but any man may serve two Mistresses.

And serve their turns well.

Nay, i will leave that to the performer.

Hark you Master Lodwick, you or any man may think he does well, and yet come
short

Briefly, directly, and learnedly spoken, sweet Fub.

I speak by proof.

Go to, your are a Knave Fub.

Hold your peace, there is more in the company.

Well said, in faith, thank him Lodwick.

It Is not worth it, though I should say as much by you.

This fellow flows with wit.

Gallants, when were you at Court? I have been desired thither forty times, my
wife (I think) has a hundred friends there: besides Cooks and Pantlers, that
she has had many a good thing of, and they have sworn to bid me welcome for her
sake


You may see what comes by marriage?

If we might see all that comes by marriage, there would be old butting abroad?

Here Is the sum, perform thy word, and claim it.

Good morrow, good Arbaces.

Make me not known to these?

Vallentius.

He?

Are you not mad, I heard no less of late.

Report's a calumnious queen, and will abuse virtue it self you see, both what
he is, and what he was

I am not sorry, that I am deceived: hear you not of Franciscus.

Upon my credit nothing.

Fair be your company, come Gentlemen.

What Is he that throws his Cloak about his nose?
Is it not Iulio?

By all exterior seeming?

My life it is he?

What should this mean?

I was asking that.

Marked you Arbaces: he has some drift in hand.

Did you not note his followers?

Yes, and the Arms they carried.

Shall we trace them, firs? and leave our wonder: I dare gage my life, the
knowledge will deserve the industry

You speak my words.

He named Franciscus.

Yes, and questioned me.

Withal, observed you but his speed.

Come, we will pursue him.

La, la, la, la: nay, I pray take me with you Gentlemen.

If not for company, for mirth's sake, take heed before there.

In mighty men how great appears the virtue nere so small; how small the vice,
though mighty Philosophy, they rules bridles my cogitations, and prolongs,
what manhood would disdain, the time to come appales my courage and strikes
instant fears through every nerve and artery: might we like beasts end when
we die, and never make account in no other place then here: what heart so base
would fear the threatening Law? Flatter the Judge to save him: I would not
sure: but there is bliss and torment much to come, we cannot think on it yet
the Resurrection aws me, I am much distempered, and want of company, begets in
me millions of terrors: Iulio tarries long, my Orisons secure him, could the
tears wash the blood but of my hands, my mind were something free


This is the place, and there Franciscus walks.

Where?

That Is he: apprehend him, i will not be seen in it.

Your office, sir.

What are these for men.

Lay hands upon him.

What mean you friends?

This we mean to attach you, as a murderer.

Arbaces, I am betrayed.

Look to the homicide, such mercy as a Tiger yields his prey, when he is pincht
for want of what is his booty, expect from me thou murderer


None I have deserved, or am about to crave, I know the worst, my life thou
can but have, It Is thine; I make a tender of it ere the sentence come, and
give thy labor ease, alas, poor Iulio: thou will unfriended, run thy future
race without society, I pity thee my friend more then my self, danger to me
is such, I do expect and dread not. Fare thee well, my breach of promise, is
not with my will, but merely on constraint


Lead him hence.

Here they are.

Who have we here bound to the good behavior? Franciscus!

My dear friend.

My brother.

Officers, why do you linger thus, away with him?

How fare you, sir?

Sick, sick to death Vallentius: shall we hence?

I now behold my fear, when I did hear Arbaces speak of him.

Something of badnesse shoot me instantly, but he does pierce me through.

Good Gentleman.

Has he recided here since he first fled?

I thought him now in Millain, where he did traffic much.

I wonder how he came to be discovered?

Beshrew my blood, I pity his estate.

Will you accord with me, show that respect you once did tender him, and
withal willingness strive to invent a means may do him ease


What, my sword, my word, or wealth can do is his, command it for him?

Let us petition to his rough adversary, and like true Suppliants in our own
behalfs, draw mercy from Arbaces

Agreed.

About it then, and our intentions thrive. Manet Julio.

The gold is mine, his certain bondage does assure me it, why should I be an
Ass, and nicely stand on that no Tradesman does: no thrifty one, what
conscience, any thing but such a word: our wise divines that preach an't, know
it not, nor make good use of that, or ought they say, but of good money: this I
daily see, and sometime make my daily meditation, all is Ceremony composed for
purpose

But be it what it will, this is my grace,
If not for one, I Am for the oath place.

Bring the offender forth.

Have mercy, good my Lord.

Believe't thou may sooner move a rock, which neither blustering wind, nor
boisterous Sea could shake or swallow, then beget remorse or smallest favor in
so foul a case: I were unjust, and much unmeet to be the man I am, should we
show mercy where the crime deserves, beyond the laws extent. He that shall
pardon murder, take it from me, is accessory to the guilty deed, and stands in
self predicament: Heaven defend we should be such, were he my Nephew, nay, my
firstborn son, or one more near: let me not be blessed in my proceedings, if
our Authority should blind his sin, or alter justice course, set him forth:
what favor equity can yield be his, no more expect Crisippus


Read the indictment.

Save that pains, guilty, nor do repent, that in my wrath I did, whereof I
stand convict

Art thou not sorry for thy heinous crime?

No mighty sir, but rather joy the more, in that it breviats my passage here,
which I would willingly leave

Impudent homicide: justice good my Lord, with that severitie which they
deserve, which wilfully commit --

Arise, thou needst not kneel, nor beg for justice, be assured Arbaces: such
his deservings, such his punishment, and cruel as the cause, thou most
brutish man, nay, beast or something worse: had thou no humanity, no spark
of reason then, nor sense, to think thy trespass foul and ugly? do not
repent thy tyranny in death, though not the deed it self: fie on thee monster,
have thou a foul and dreadst not her perdition: what heathen savage, nay, what
ruder thing, having the life thou soughtst, would have enacted such a deed of
ruth, as thou, thou worst of creatures, on the image and livelesse carcass of
thy loving friend


'Twas most uncivil, most unchristianly.

An act, a Tigre would not have performed, on one that had slain his brood.

Hear me good my Lord.

My poor Antonio.

That I did take his life, I have confessed, what further accusations laid on
me, is merely malice, and proceed from some, could wish my torment worse


Out on thee butcher: give me leave my Lord.

Silence.

Can thou deny thy wrathful cruelty, impetuous tyranny, and fell revenge
upon his bleeding trunk

Unless I should belie my self, and speak like a vain boaster, more then
what I did, I must say this is false, and he is from truth, as far as I am
from hope of life, begot this slander


Produce your proof Arbaces, strike blushes through the cheeks of this false
man, and let him see his shame

What Devil should be raised from the lowest hell, to justify this wrong?

This is strange.

I never thought Franciscus one so foul, as I behold him now.

Not thought, I durst have sworn him of a purer mettle* and better temper far.

Prosperity to the Venetian State.

Iulio: he is not his proof I hope.

Is this the Gentleman?

This is he my Lord.

Make room, give way there.

How comes this about?

The fact's confessed, my Lord, what need we further wade into the Law, or heap
on troubles which we may eschew, upon so plain a case? the crime is Murder,
Murder is confessed, then as you find the guilt, proceed to judgment, and make
no further question


We shall be sudden.

My sentence, good my Lord.

Speak, sir, can you report any thing more touching this business then what
already is delivered here in the open Court


No more or less, then what his own tongue uttered, can I or have to say.

How Is that?

We were once friends: once had I such opinion of his virtues, my life and
estimation were both his, he might command them, much it were to speak of all
that past between us: thus in short, I would some other were compelled to this,
which you have tied me too, my nearest friend alive


Arbaces: was this the man gave you first notice where this Murderer kept?

The same my Lord.

Did he betray me? can this be.

Forward.

Speak.

Must we be enforced, what should I speak, he flue him, ripped his bowels,
mangled him, and in his wrath, as man will any thing: tumbled his reeking
quarters down a Vault most steep and loathsome: what of this, he might deserve
much worse austeritie, yet this was bad enough


Ha?

Justice, gracious Prince, justice, justice, sir.

Is this truth?

Let me be deposed --

The most erroneous, execrable part that ever was performed.

Were he my father, should forget himself, and match this outrage, mercy
quite forsake me if I would sue his pardon

It was ruthlesse, fell, and bloody.

Look not up for shame, thou have no interest there.

I have done wrong, mighty, mighty wrong.

Can thou behold it now?

Pardon me father, pardon good Arbaces: that villain, that foul villain.

'Twas time to come.

Show mercy, mercy, Duke.

Pity our complaints, have some compassion.

What are these that make this earnest deprecation, with such a hearty zeal;
are they well known to this assembly

Cornelia, sister.

Fair Phemone.

When will these humid fountains be dried up, and yield no more warm drops?

My sweet Franciscus.

Some good or bad thing fell me suddenly, let me behold no more.

Is that his wife?

She was my Lord, while some hard fate dis-joyn'd their mutual league, and
burst the holy concord

Will thou pardon me and live a happy one, when I am dead, and lapt in this
cold earth

Franciscus I was ever true to you.

I see it, and believe: that villain, oh, that villain!

Harken thy sentence.

Hear me my good Lord, little I have to say, yet to much grief tend my few
words, this traitor, nay, it is title all too good for one so heinous foul,
that he is perjured, by the death I owe his latest words do witness what he
is more, and worse: with pardon Lords, I shall delate at large, that all
hereafter may example take, and shun a villains snare; I took him up, when
like an Adder in the frosty dew, the cold had starved him: that I had set my
foot upon his head, when to my bosom I did take the Serpent, not cherisht,
comforted long had he been, but he both bit and stung me: foolish man I was
to be so fond, not many months, nor happy days I had with this most truest,
most immaculate piece, but that perfidious Caitiffe, that black fiend by
strange suggestions, and invented projects, draws me into a confirmed
jealousy, that she had stained her honor, falsely played with young Antonio


O forgive me heaven, what is this?

I from my wrong conceived, least could I not, Drew him apart into a silent
Grove, Having before vowed solemnly revenge, Where I made some repetition of my
grief: he still (I see him) innnocent gentleman, taking my words For such as
Lovers use, when they are wanton, Smiles me in the face, and would not thing
'twas anger


It Is truth he speaks.

This inkindled me, and as Boar,
When he does chaw his foame, predicts some mischief,
So my bended front foretold his ruin,
Forth I drew my sword, and sheathed it
Within his breast, what else is added,
He Is a Jew averres, and falser than a whore.

See, see the Ages wickedness: can it be possible?
O miserable time, when men make no more reckoning of their souls! Fie, fie,
Francisco, think upon your end, and whither you must go. Most reverend
Fathers, observe you this his contumacy: I shall I fear be forced to speak
what in my heart till now I chested, and rib'd in, because mine oath, 'twas not
my will has hear constrained me to expose his blame, my soul had vowed to
hide; Note into malice how he throws himself, and would stain my reputation
with a calumnious lie


Art thou a man, or something else; oh fool, fool.

Is this possible?

Give ear unto thy sentece.

I must, in --

Did not I say he is mad, stark raving mad, away with him. The man's alive
that is dead

Yes, they supt together: I love this fellow.

Your Grace shall do well to punish this saucy groom.

You are a most pernicious damned villain, and your soul knows it.

Come, sir, depart, and rave not, or I shall see you whipped.

Good Father pardon; pardon mighty Duke, pardon Antonio, cause of this
disquiet. Lod. Antonio

By this light he supt with him indeed.

It is not so, this cannot be.

Is there no mountain nigh to fall on me, no roten house?

I know not whether I may call thee son, or rest in doubt for ever.

I am Antonio, and I was your son, when I left Venice last.

Is no man here amazed but only I?

My dear Phemone!

Were you the Shepherd?

You see chaste Cornelia.

Was ever man so blessed?

Nay, come Francisco, I must have your hand: I can as well forgive, as I can
love; and nothing more than both: good Crissippus, my old friend


You have bin a stranger Signior; but I Am glad it is thus.

Whither away: stay him officers; we have not done with you.

Wither shall I run to hide my self?
What Climate, or what Region? Pardon greatest Prince.
Pardon grave Fathers.

Against that prayer kneel I:
No pardon Prince, as thou do hope for bliss.

Grant him a halter; nothing else good Duke.

Give him his liberty: Art thou so impudent to plead for mercy, and beg of me,
having committed such a capital trespass here in my view


Though what I speak, with some additions, I have done and more, and he more
false has played, than I have said, blot his offenses: be propitious Sir


Though the greatest sufferance fell on my part, I here acquit him, and beseech
for mercy

Yet be compendious, and possess this presence, what cause thou had that
tempted thee so badly to seek my ruin

The Devil and his Angels.

O fie Ioretzo.

How Ioretzo? not the son of that pernicious traitor, had plotted with
Lamunes for sums of gold to burn our City

He Is dead, and suffered for the same offense.

When brought the toad forth other than himself, unless 'twere something
worse

Forget his Fathers faults: be pitiful.

He that prays next in his behalf, by heaven friends not himself, and is mine
enemy: We have too long suffered such Weeds as these to flourish in our soil:
No more the bosom of this earth of ours, shall (like a mother) lend her
fruitless increase, to cherish those would bane her: The sword of justice cut
the justice off that keeps it sheathed to such: His deeds were shameful, his
rewards be so, and quittance his desert: S^are on his brow in letters
cappitall, the name of knave, that all behold may read him what he is, and
hate him in the sight: His next doom is this; after three days we charge thee
on thy life, never set foot more in thy Native Climate

So, bear him to his torture, speech is vain:
For what is said there is nothing can restrain.

Most worthy Prince.

I Will be honester while I live for this trick.

Can you forgive mine injury, Antonio?

As freely as I hope to be forgiven; and crave no more amends, but only this
you will call me brother, and make Phemone mine


I need not make what is made, take and enjoy her that has vowed to be none but
yours

Thy hand Arbaces, our quarrell's over, we will no fighting.

Fight, yes: I hope we shall find something else to do.

Daughter I have done thee wrong too; but I Will seek forgiveness when we have
more leisure

This day breeds wonders: by what accident escaped you of your wounds?

Here stands the means, whom I must ever tender with respect, as with my full
proceedings you shall hear, when none can interrupt


Francisco, henceforth know your virtuous wife, and prize her as a jewel: I
have heard the world speak well of her, and those unmatched wish they may have
your fortunes. Lodwicke where is the dumb show you promised me


Even ready my Lord; but may be called a motion: for puppits will speak but such
corrupt language, you will never understand without an interpreter, or a short
plot; which I have drawn thus -- Now the motion follows


What not divulge: yes, yes, I will divulge.

The jealous Doctor: I have him.

Do me right, sweet Duke, do me right.

What art?

A fool, a physician, a maintainer of whoredom, with a pox to me.

Then Medice cura teipsum; more knave than fool, the plot's false drawn else:
away with em

Come sir, depart.

Purge me Duke, purge me, or let my wife take out my corrupted brains, and
rince them in a Cucking-stoole: I come Skimmington, I come


Vallentius you must take some order for the Doctors cure: he befriended you in
as great a courtesy

Trot on before: is the Corne-cutter come yet?

The Horne-cutter is come, sir.

On, on to the Leaguer then: I am ashamed to show my head amongst Animalls: on
to the Leaguer

This is a Monster of your making, Lodwicke, buy him a Cap-case to hide up his
horns in, for shame of the world

Come we are both --

He comes, he comes.

Where does he come? he is rather drawn hither like a Bare to a stake.

What in a Coach?

Nay, rather in an open Chariot: and yet it cannot be properly called a
Chariot, because it runs but on two Wheels


Room for him there: for I am sure he had rather any here had his room than
his company

Silence there; you in the Docket there, let but one speak in the Court at
once

Noverint universi,
It is the Dukes mercy;
And the condition of my Obligation,
To make my recantation,
That I within bound,
Should give reasons profound,
Why (much against my heart)
I thus ride in a Cart.
Nay, gentlemen, no eggs I beseech you: for I love them at this time, neither
raw, roasted, nor rotten. For should they hit me on the breast, they would go
clean against my stomach


You Phaeton.
Is that your Father Phoebus his Chariot, and will he allow you never a Box to
sit in

No juglers Box, I Will assure thee friend: for here is neither pass, nor
repasse, I stand here you see for an example, And could wish all these good
people to follow it


Who Is that, Boots mounted in his Charles waine? does he cry Pippings,
Carrets, or Turnips

You are deceived, Signior: rather Bread, and Meat, as Pye-crust, bones, and
fragments out of the Ludgate man's basket: Nay, hold your hands, I beseech you
Gentlemen, and use your tongues and spare not


Well, he stands hear but for a show, and I am sure I suffered for it really
and indeed

Bear witness my Masters, that is the maine malefactor indeed, and I stand
here for a show: I Will go no further than his own confession


They talk of Cheaters, here is a twenty shillings piece that I put into my
mouth, let any Cheater in Christendom cosen me of this, and carry it away
cleanly, and I Will not only forgive him, but hug him and embrace him for it,
and say he is a very Hocus Pocus indeed


What said that fellow?

He says he has a piece in his mouth, that all Europe shall not cheat him of.

I have marked him, it is mine own: and notwithstanding all this melancholy
we will spend it at night in Wine and Music


He that can pluck this piece out of my jaws, spite of my teeth, and I
keep my mouth fast shut, I Will say he is more than a Cheater, and a Doctor
Faustus, or Mephostophilus at least


Do hear how he brags?

It Is mine own I warrant thee.

But what is become of my horse?

And what is become of my load of hay?

May I eat hay with your horse, if they were not both done neatly and cleanly.
But Gentlemen, and the rest, you see I am at this present your pitiful
spectacle. I looked once within this twelve month, not to have been mounted in
such state: but no man knows what preferment he is born to. You see I have
hitherto sailed through this great storm without soyling my Suite, spoiling my
Ruff, or spattering my Beaver: thanks to these kind spectators


But Master Fast and Loose; do you remember what a slippery trick you served
Master Doctor and us

And was it not fairly done Master Sergeant, to teach you how to digest the
wearing of a Surplice, before you came to stand in a white sheet


Well now you are at your journies end: May it please you to alight for your
ease

Withal my heart: and if either you or any of my accusers be weary with
following me on foot, the Room is now empty, I will give him leave to ride in
my place.

He draws his handkerchiefe (as to wipe his eyes) just before the Country
fellow, and scatters some small money

Sir, you have (I think) let fall some money.

Thanks honest friend.

What do you look for? I can assure you here is all that fell.

Nay, sure I had more money? it is not in my handkerchief, nor in my pockets, I
have examined them both

Why, what do you want sir?

A piece, a piece, and had it now, just now; sure whilst I was so high pearcht
none could dive so low into my pocket, it was sure as I lighted, and dropped from
me, just as I drew my handkerchief


Some such thing I saw fall.

Pray who were they that stoopt?

I saw none stoop but this Country fellow.

Then sir, I must demand this piece of you.

Of me? I profess I took up but two shillings and six pence, and that I gave
into your hand

But I profess that one of them was a piece, and never came into my hand, and
that I must demand of you: say did no body stoop but he


None I assure you.

Thou art still my honest Sergeant.

That fellow has something in his mouth.

Yes my tongue and my teeth, and what of all that.

Nay, something else sure, for he is not troubled with the Mumps, and yet see
how one side of his cheeks bumps out

I am afraid, we shall find him a Cheater.

Sirrah know I am an Officer, I charge you open your mouth, and let us see what
you have in it, etc

Well sir, I have a twenty shillings piece, what then?

And this man misseth a twenty shilling piece out of his pocket.

Plead well Sergeant and thou shall have thy see.

Well, there it is, what can you make of it?

Marry twenty shillings good and lawful current money, Puss, was not this the
piece that I put in my pocket this morning


I know it by that mark.

And she is witness sufficient in conscience.

Do you see Gentlemen. I am here brought to public penance for a Cheater, and
here is a plain fellow that (it seems) in his simplicity would out-doe me: if I
be thus censured merely for suspicion; shall he escape free that is taken in
the very action


No, no, mount him, mount him.

Nay, by your favor Gentlemen, I have driven a Cart often for my pleasure, and
would be loath to ride in one now for my punishment. It is penance enough for
me to part with my piece, which cannot be more current of Coin, then his is
Arrant for Knavery


He Is gone, I am still here, now Gentlemen,
If heretofore there has been any Doll,
Any bold Beachum, and any Cutpurse Moll.
Any Bawd fat with wealth, or with care meager,
That spends her time in Garrison or Leager,
Grace me so far to say, that of a Cheater
Though some have been more grave; scarce any greater,
But Gentlemen; what need we more repeating?
Knowing, that even in all Trades there is cheating?
It Is common both in buying and in selling,
In all Commerce; nay, even in money telling.
It Is frequent 'twixt the Pander and the Whore,
We our selves find it at the Playhouse door.
And though (for an example) here I stand,
I am not all the Cheaters in the land.
Some here (no question) know it but I vow,
(They what they please) I will cheat none of you.

We understand their humors,
And the cause of their distempers;
And have too long suffered such weeds
As these to flourish in our soil,
But now no longer shall this earth of ours,
Like a ^inde Mother lend her fruits increase,
To cherish those would eclipse her worth.
But those whose aims and acts are imitable,
Crown with green Garlands, and with Bowls brim'd full.
Music proclaim a general Festival,
A Jubilee of joy and mirth to all:
May love and truth, never like comfort miss,
Nor Knave in Grain, escape a reward like this.
