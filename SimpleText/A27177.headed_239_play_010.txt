I Would we were removed from this Town, Anthony
That we might taste some quiet: for mine own part,
I Am almost melted with continual trotting
After enquities, dreams, and revelations,
Of who knows, whom or where? serve wenching soldiers,
That know no other Paradise but Plackets:
I Will serve a Priest in Lent, first and eat Bell-ropes.

Thou art the froward'st fool --

Why good tame Anthony?
Tell me but this: to what end came we hither?

To wait upon our Masters.

But how Anthony?
Answer me that; resolve me there good Anthony?

To serve their uses.

Show your uses Anthony.

To be employed in any thing.

No Anthony,
Not any thing I take it; nor that thing
We travel to discover, like new Islands;
A salt itch serve such uses; in things of moment,
Concerning things I grant ye, not things errant,
Sweet Ladies things, and things to thank the Surgeon:
In no such things, sweet Anthony, put case --

Come, come, all will be mended: this invisible woman
Of infinite report for shape and virtue,
That bred us all this trouble to no purpose,
They are determined now no more to think on,
But fall close to their studies.

Was there ever
Men known to run mad with report before?
Or wonder after that they know not where
To find? or if found, how to enjoy? are men's brains
Made now a days of Malt, that their affections
Are never sober? but like drunken people
Founder at every new fame? I do believe too
That men in love are ever drunk, as drunken men
Are ever loving.

Prithee be thou sober,
And know, that they are none of those, not guilty
Of the least vanity of love, only a doubt
Fame might too far report, or rather flatter
The graces of this woman, made them curious
To find the truth, which since they find so blotted
And locked up from their searches, they are now settled
To give the wonder ever.

Would they were settled
To give me some new shoes too: for I Will be sworn
These are e'ne worn out to the reasonable souls
In their good worships business: and some sleep
Would not do much amiss, unless they mean
To make a Bell-man on me: and what now
Mean they to study, Anthony, Moral Philosophy
After their mar-all women?

Mar a fools head.

'Twill mar two fools heads, and they take not heed,
Besides the Giblets to 'em.

Will you walk Sir,
And talk more out of hearing? your fools head
May chance to find a wooden nightcap else.

I never lay in any.


Then leave your lying,
And your blind Prophesying: here they come,
You had best tell them as much.

I am no tell-tale.

I would we could have seen her though: for sure
She must be some rare creature, or report lies,
All men's reports too,

I could well wish I had seen her;
But since she is so concealed, so beyond venture
Kept and preserved from view, so like a Paradise,
Placed where no knowledge can come near her; so guarded
As 'twere impossible, though known to reach her,
I have made up my belief.

Hang me from this hour
If I more think upon her, or believe her,
But as she came a strong report unto me,
So the next Fame shall loose her.

It Is the next way:
But whither are you walking?

My old round
After my meat, and then to bed.

It Is healthfulll.

Will not you stir?

I have a little business.

Upon my life this Lady still --

Then you will loose it.

Pray let us walk together.

Now I cannot.

I have something to impart.

An hour hence
I will not miss to meet you.

Where?

In The high street;
For not to lie, I have a few Devotions
To do first, then I am yours.

Remember.

Cut his winde-pipe, I say.

Fie Antonio.

Or knock his brains out first, then forgive him
If you do thrust, be sure it be to the hilts,
A Surgeon may see through him.

You are too violent,

Too open, undiscreet.

Am I not ruined?
The honor of my house cracked? my blood poisoned?
My credit, and my name?

Be sure it be so,
Before ye use this violence. Let not doubt,
And a suspecting anger so much sway ye,
Your wisdom may be questioned.

I say kill him,
And then dispute the cause; cut off what may be,
And what is, shall be safe.

Hang up a true man,
Because it is possible he may be theevish:
Alas, is this good Justice?

I know as certain,
As day must come again; as clear as truth.
And open as belief can lay it to me,
That I am basely wronged, wronged above recompense;
Maliciously abused, blasted for ever
In name and honor, lost to all remembrance,
But what is smeared, and shameful; I must kill him,
Necessity compells me.

But think better

There is no other cure left: yet witness with me
All that is fair in man, all that is noble,
I am not greedy of this life I seek for,
Nor thirst to shed man's blood; and would 'twere possible
I wish it with my soul, so much I tremble
To offend the sacred Image of my Maker,
My sword could only kill his crimes: no it is honor,
Honor, my noble friends, that idol honor,
That all the world now worships, not Petruchio
Must do this justice.

Let it once be done,
And it is no matter, whether you, or honor,
Or both be accessarie.

Do you weigh Petruchio
The value of the person, power, and greatness,
And what this spark may kindle?

To perform it,
So much I am tied to reputation,
And credit of my house, let it raise wild-sires,
That all this Dukedom smoke, and storms that toss me
Into the storms of everlasting ruin,
Yet I must through; if ye dare side me.

Dare?

You Are friends indeed, if not.

Here Is none flies from you,
Do it in what design ye please, we will back ye.

But then be sure ye kill him.

Is the cause
So mortal, nothing but his life?

Believe me,
A less offense has been the desolation
Of a whole name.

No other way to purge it?

There is, but never to be hoped for,

Think an hour more,
And if then ye find no safer road to guide ye,
We Will set up our rests too.

Mine Is up already,
And hang him for my part,
Goes less than life.

If we see noble cause, it is like our swords
May be as free and forward as your words.

The civil order of this Town Bellonia
Makes it beloved, and honored of all travelers,
As a most safe retirement in all troubles;
Beside the wholesome seat, and noble temper
Of those minds that inhabit it, safely wise,
And to all strangers virtuous: But I see
My admiration has drawn night upon me,
And longer to expect my friend may pull me
Into suspicion of too late a stirrer,
Which all good Governments are jealous of.
I Will home, and think at liberty: yet certain,
It Is not so far night as I thought; for see,
A fair house yet stands open, yet all about it
Are close, and no lights stirring: there may be foul play:
I Will venture to look in: if there be knaves,
I may do a good office.

Signieur?

What? how is this?

Signieur Fabritio?

I Will go nearer.

Fabritio?

This is a woman's tongue, here may be good done.

Who Is there?
Fabritio?

I.

Where are ye?

Here.

O come, for heavens sake!

I must see what this means,

I have stayed this long hour for you, make no noise,
For things are in strange trouble: here, be secret,
It Is worth your care; begone now; more eyes watch us,
Then may be for our safeties.

Hark ye?

Peace: good night.

She is gone, and I am laden; fortune for me;
It weighes well, and it feels well; it may chance
To be some pack of worth: by the mass it is heavy;
If it be Coin or Jewels, it is worth welcome:
I Will never refuse a fortune: I am confident
It Is of no common price: now to my lodging:
If it hit right, I Will bless this night.

It Is strange,
I cannot meet him; sure he has encountered
Some light of love or other, and there means
To play at In and In for this night. Well Don John,
If you do spring a leak, or get an itch,
Til ye claw off your curled pate, thank your night-walks:
You must be still a bootehalling: one round more,
Though it be late, I Will venture to discover ye,
I do not like your out-leaps.

Welcome to Town, are ye all fit?

To point Sir,

Where are the horses?

Where they were appointed.

Be private, and whatsoever fortune
Offer it self, let us stand sure.

Fear not us,
'Ere ye shall be endangered, or deluded,
We Will make a black night on it.

No more, I know it;
You know your Quarters?

Will you go alone sir?

Ye shall not be far from me, the least noise
Shall bring ye to my rescue.

We are counseled.

Was ever man so paid for being curious?
Ever so bob'd for searching out adventures,
As I am? did the devil lead me? must I needs be peeping
Into men's houses where I had no business,
And make my self a mischief? It Is well carried;
I must take other men's occasions on me,
And be I know not whom: most finely handled:
What have I got by this now? what is the purchase?
A piece of evening Arras work, a child,
Indeed an Infidel: this comes of peeping:
A lump got out of laziness; good white bread
Let Us have no bawling with ye: 'sdeath, have I
Known Wenches thus long, all the ways of wenches,
Their snares and subtilties? have I read over
All their School learnings, dived into their quiddits,
And am I now bum-fidled with a Bastard?
Fetched over with a Card of five, and in mine old days,
After the dire massacre of a million
Of Maiden-heads? caught the common way, ith'night too
Under another name, to make the matter
Carry more weight about it? well Don John,
You will be wiser one day, when ye have purchased
A beavy of these Butter prints together,
With searching out concealed iniquities,
Without commission: why, it would never grieve me,
If I had got this Ginger-bread: never stirred me,
So I had had a stroke for it: 't had been Justice
Then to have kept it; but to raise a dayrie
For other men's adulteries, consume my self in candles,
And scowring works, in Nurses Bells and Babies,
Only for charity, for mere I thank you,
A little troubles me: the least touch for it,
Had but my breeches got it, had contented me.
Whose e're it is, sure to had a wealthy mother,
For it is well clothed, and if I be not cozened,
Well lined within: to leave it here were barbarous,
And ten to one would kill it: a more sin
Then his that got it: well, I will dispose on it,
And keep it, as they keep deaths heads in rings,
To cry, memento to me; no more peeping.
Now all the danger is to qualify
The good old gentlewoman, at whose house we live,
For she will fall upon me with a Catechism
Of four hours long: I must endure all;
For I will know this mother: Come good wonder,
Let you and I be jogging: your starved trebble
Will waken the rude watch else: All that be
Curious night-walkers, may they find my fee.

Sure he is gone home:
I have beaten all the purlewes,
But cannot bolt him: if he be a bobbing
It Is not my care can cure him: To morrow morning
I shall have further knowledge from a Surgeons --
Where he lies moord, to mend his leaks.

I Am ready,
And through a world of dangers am slown to ye.
Be full of haste and care, we are undone else:
Where are your people? which way must we travel?
For heaven sake stay not here sir.

What may this prove?

Alas I am mistaken, lost, undone.
For ever perished. Sir, for heaven sake tell me,
Are ye a Gentleman?

I am.

Of this place?

No, borne in Spain.

As ever you loved honor,
As ever your desires may gain their ends,
Do a poor wretched woman but this benefit,
For I am forced to trust ye.

You Have charmed me,
Humanity and honor bids me help ye;
And if I fail your trust. --

The time's too dangerous
To stay your protestations: I believe ye,
Alas, I must believe ye: From this place,
Good noble Sir, remove me instantly,
And for a time, where nothing but your self,
And honest conversation my come near me,
In some secure place settle me. What I am,
And why thus boldly I commit my credit
Into a strangers hand, the fears and dangers,
That force me to this wild course, at more leisure
I shall reveal unto you.

Come, be hearty,
He must strike through my life that takes ye from me.

He will sure come. Are ye well armed?

Never fear us.
Here Is that will make 'em dance without a Fiddle.

We are to look for no weak foes, my friends,
Nor unadvised ones.

Best gamsters make the best game,
We shall fight close and handsome then.

Antonio,
You are a thought too bloody.

Why? all Physicians
And penny Almanacks allow the opening
Of veins this month: why do ye talk of bloody?
What come we for, to fall to cuffes for apples?
What, would ye make the Cause a Cudgel quarrel?
On what terms stands this man? is not his honor
Opened to his hand, and picked out like an Oyster?
His credit like a quart pot knocked together,
Able to hold no liquor? clear but this point.

Speak softly, gentle Cousen.

I Will speak truly;
What should men do allied to these disgraces,
Lick over his enemy, sit down, and dance him?

You are as far of the bow hand now.

And cry;
That Is my fine boy, thou will do so no more child.

Here are no such cold pitties.

By Saint Jaques
They shall not find me one: here is old tough Andrew,
A special friend of mine, and he but hold,
He strike 'em such a horne-pipe: knocks I come for,
And the best blood I light on; I profes it,
Not to scarre Coster-mongers; If I loose mine own,
Mine audits lost, and farewell five and fifty.

Let Us talk no longer, place your selves with silence,
As I directed ye; and when time calls us,
As ye are friends, so show your selves.

So be it.

Nay Son, if this be your regard.

Good mother.

Good me no goods; your Cozen, and your self
Are welcome to me, whilst you bear your selves
Like honest and true Gentlemen: Bring hither
To my house, that have ever been reputed
A gentlewoman of a decent, and fair carriage,
And so behaved my self?

I know ye have.

Bring hither, as I say, to make my name
Stink in my neighbors nostrills? your Devises,
Your Brats, got out of Alligant, and broken oaths?
Your Linsey Woolsey work, your hasty puddings?
I fosler up your filch'd iniquities?
You Are deceived in me, Sir, I am none
Of those receivers.

Have I not sworn unto you,
It Is none of mine, and showed you how I found it?

Ye found an easy fool that let you get it,
She had better have worn pastornes.

Will ye hear me?

Oaths? what do you care for oaths to gain your ends,
When ye are high and pampered? What Saint know ye?
Or what Religion, but your purposed lewdness,
Is to be looked for of ye? nay, I will tell ye,
You will then swear like accused Cut-purses,
As far of truth too; and lie beyond all Faulconers:
I Am sick to see this dealing.

Heaven forbid Mother.

Nay, I am very sick.

Who waits there?

Sir.

Bring down the bottle of Canary wine.

Exceeding sick, heaven help me.

Haste ye sirrah,
I must even make her drunk; nay gentle mother;

Now sie upon ye, was it for this purpose
You fetched your evening walks for your digestions,
For this pretended holiness? no weather,
Not before day could hold ye from the Matins.
Were these your bo-peep prayers? ye have praid well,
And with a learned zeal: watched well too; your Saint
It seems was pleased as well: still sicker, sicker.

There is no talking to her till I have drencht her.
Give me: here mother take a good round draught,
'Twill purge spleen from your spirits: deeper mother.

I, I, son; you imagine this will mend all.

All in faith Mother.

I confess the Wine
Will do his part.

I Will pledge ye.

But son John.

I know your meaning mother; touch it once more,
Alas you look not well; take a round draught,
It warmes the blood well, and restores the color,
And then we will talk at large.

A civil gentleman?
A stranger? one the Town holds a good regard of?

Nay I will silence there.

One that should weigh his fair name? oh, a stichl

There Is nothing better for a stitch, good mother,
Make no spare of it, as you love your health,
Mince not the nutter.

As I said, a gentleman,
Lodge in my house? now heavens my comfort, Signior!

I looked for this.

I did not think you would havo used me thus;
A woman of my credit: one, heaven knows,
That loved you but too tenderly.

Dear mother,
I ever found your kindness, and acknowledge it.

No, no, I am a fool to counsel ye. Where Is the infant?
Come, lets see your Workmanship.

None of mine, Mother.
But there it is, and a lusty one.

Heaven bless thee,
Thou had a hasty making; but the best is,
It Is many a good man's fortune: as I live
Your own eyes Signior, and the nether lip
As like ye, as ye had spit it.

I am glad on it.

Bless me, what things are these?

I thought my labor
Was not all lost, it is gold, and these are jewels,
Both rich, and right I hope.

Well, well son John,
I see ye are a wood-man, and can choose
Your Dear, though it be in the dark, all your discretion
Is not yet lost; this was well clapped aboard:
Here I am with you now; when as they say
Your pleasure comes with profit; when ye must needs do,
Do where ye may be done to, it is a wisdom
Becomes a young man well: be sure of one thing,
Loose not your labor and your time together,
It seasons of a fool, son, time is precious,
Work wary whilst ye have it; since ye must traffic
Sometimes this slippery way, take sure hold Signior,
Trade with no broken Merchants, make your lading,
As you would make your rest, adventurously,
But with advantage ever.

All this time mother,
The child wants looking too, wants meat and Nurses.

Now blessing of thy care; it shall have all,
And instantly; I Will seek a Nurse my self, son;
It Is a sweet child: ah my young Spaniard;
Take you no further care sir.

Yes of these Jewels,
I must by your leave Mother: these are yours,
To make your care the stronger: for the rest
I Will find a Master; the gold for bringing up on it,
I freely render to your charge.

No more words,
Nor no more children, (good son) as you love me,
This may do well.

I shall observe your Morals.
But where is Don Ferdinand (Mother)

Ten to one
About the like adventure: he told me.
He was to find you out.

Why should he stay thus?
There may be some ill chance in it: sleep I will not,
Before I have found him: now this woman's pleased,
I Will seek my friend out, and my care is eased.

Believe sir, it is as possible to do it,
As to remove the City; the maine faction,
Swarm through the streets like hornets, armed with angers
Able to ruin States: no safety left us,
Nor means to dye like men, if instantly
You draw not back again,

May he be drawn
And quartered too, that turns now; were I surer
Of death then thou art of thy fears, and with death
More then those fears are too.

Sir, I fear not.

I would not crack my vow, start from my honor,
Because I may find danger; wound my soul,
To keep my body safe.

I speak not sir,
Out of a baseness to you.

No, nor do not
Out of a baseness leave mo: what is danger,
More then the weakness of our apprehensions?
A poor cold part o'th blood? who takes it hold of?
Cowards, and wicked livers: valiant minds
Were made the Masters of it, and as hearty Seamen
In desperate storms, stem with a little Rudder
The tumbling ruins of the Ocean:
So with their cause and swords do they do dangers.
Say we year sure to dye all in this venture,
As I am confident against it: is there any
Amongst us of so fat a sense, so pampered,
Would chule luxuriously to lie a bed,
And purge away his spirit, send his soul out
In Sugar-lops, and Syrups? give me dying,
As dying out to be, upon mine enemy,
Parting with mankind, by a man that is manly:
Let 'em be all the world, and bring along
Cain's envy with 'em, I will on.

You may sir,
But with what safety?

Since it is come to dying,
You shall perceive sir, here be those amongst us
Can dye as decently as other men,
And with as little ceremony: on brave sir.

That Is spoken heartily.

And he that flinches
May he dye lowzie in a ditch.

No more dying,
There Is no such danger in it:
What Is a clock?

Somewhat above your hour.

Away then quickly,
Make no noise, and no trouble will attend us.

Give me the candle: so go you out that way.

What have we now to do?

And of your life sirrah,
Let none come near the door without my knowledge,
No not my Land lady, nor my friend.

It Is done sir.

Nor any serious business that concerns me.

Is the wind there again?

Be gone.

I am sir.

Now enter without fear. -- And noble Lady
That safety and civility ye wished for
Shall truly here attend you: no rude tongue
Nor rough behavior knows this place, no wishes
Beyond the moderation of a man,
Dare enter here: your own desires and Innocence,
Joined to my vowed obedience, shall protect you,
Were dangers more then doubts.

Ye are truly noble,
And worth a woman's trust: let it become me,
(I do beseech you sir) for all your kindness,
To render with my thanks, this worthless trifle;
I may be longer troublesome.

Fair offices
Are still their own rewards: Heaven bless me Lady
From selling civil courtesies: may it please ye,
If ye will force a favor to oblige me,
Draw but that cloud aside, to satisfy me
For what good Angel I am engaged,

It shall be.
For I am truly confident ye are honest:
The Piece is scarce worth looking on.

Trust me
The abstract of all beauty, soul of sweetness,
Defend me honest thoughts, I shall grow wild else:
What eyes are there, rather what little heavens,
To stir men's contemplations? what a Paradise
Runs through each part she has? good blood be temperate:
I must look off: too excellent an object
Confounds the sense that sees it Noble Lady,
If there be any further service to cast on me,
Let it be worth my life, so much I honor ye,
Or the engagement of whole Families.

Your service is too liberal, worthy sir,
Thus far I shall entreat.

Command me Lady.
You make your power too poor.

That presently
With all convenient haste, you would retire
Unto the street you found me in.

It Is done.

There, if you find a gentleman oppressed
With force and violence, do a man's office,
And draw your sword to rescue him.

He Is safe,
Be what he will, and let his foes be devils,
Armed with your pity, I shall conjure 'em.
Retire, this key will guide ye: all things necessary
Are there before ye.

All my prayers go with ye.

Ye clap on proof upon me: men say gold
Does all, engages all, works through all dangers:
Now I say beauty can do more: The Kings Exchequer,
Nor all his wealthy Indies, could not draw me
Through half those miseries this piece of pleasure
Might make me leap into: we are all like sea-Cards,
All our endeavors and our motions,
(As they do to the North) still point at beauty,
Still at the fairest: for a handsome woman,
(Setting my soul a side) it should go hard,
But I would strain my body: yet to her,
Unless it be her own free gratitude,
Hopes ye shall dye, and thou tongue rot within me,
E're I infringe my faith: now to my rescue.

YOu will not all oppress me?

Kill him in the wanton eye: let me come to him.

Then ye shall buy me dearly.

Say you so sir?

I say cut his Wezand spoil his peeping.
Have at your lovesick heart sir.

Sure it is fighting.
My friend may be engaged: fie gentlemen,
This is unmanly odds.

I Will stop your mouth sir.


Nay, then have at thee freely:
There Is a plumb sir to satisfy your longing.

Away: I hope I have sped him: here comes rescue.
We shall be endangered: where is Antonio?

I must have one thrust more sir.

Come up to me.

A mischief confound your fingers.

How is it?

Well:
Has given me my quiet us est, I felt him
In my small guts, I Am sure, has feez'd me:
This comes of siding with ye.

Can you go sir?

I should go man, and my head were of,
Never talk of going.

Come, all shall be well then.
I hear more rescue coming.

Let Us turn back then;
My skull's uncloven yet, let me but kill.

Away for heaven sake with him.

How is it?

Well sir,
Only a little staggered.

Lets pursue 'em.

No not a man, I charge ye: thanks good coat,
Thou have saved me a shrewd welcome: 't was put home too,
With a good mind I Am sure on it.

Are ye safe then?

My thanks to you brave sir, whose timely valor,
And manly courtesy came to my rescue,

Ye' had foul play offered ye, and shame befall him
That can pass by oppression.

May I crave sir,
But thus much honor more, to know your name?
And him I am so bound to?

For the Bond sir,
It Is every good man's tie: to know me further
Will little profit ye; I am a stranger,
My Country Spain; my name Don John, a gentleman
That lies here for my study.

I have heard sir,
Much worthy mention of ye, yet I find
Fame short of what ye are.

You are pleased sir,
To express your courtesy: may I demand
As freely what you are, and what mischance
Cast you into this danger?

For this present
I must desire your pardon: you shall know me
Ere it be long sir, and a nobler thanks,
Then now my will can render.

Your will's your own sir.

What is it you look for sir, have ye lost any thing?

Only my hat in the scuffle; sure these fellows
Were night-snaps.

No, believe sir: pray ye use mine,
For 'twil be hard to find your own now.

No sir.

Indeed ye shall, I can command another:
I do beseech ye honor me.

I will sir,
And so I Will take my leave.

Within these few days
I hope I shall be happy in your knowledge.
Till when I love your memory.

I yours.
This is some noble fellow.

It Is his tongue sure.
Don John?

Don Fredrick?

Ye' are fairly met sir:
I thought ye had been a Bat-fowling: prithee tell me,
What Revelations have thou had to night,
That home was never thought of?

Revelations?
I Will tell thee Fredrick. but before I tell thee,
Settle thy understanding.

It Is prepared, sir.

Why then mark what shall follow. This night Fredr.
This bawdy night.

I thought no less.

This blind night,
What do think I have got?

The Pox it may be.

Would 'twere no worse: ye talk of Revelations,
I have got a Revelation will reveal me,
An arrant Coxcombe while I live.

What is it?
Thou have lost nothing?

No, I have got I tell thee.

What have thou got?

One of the Infantry, a child.

How?

A chopping child, man.

Give ye joy, sir.

A lump of lewdness Fredrick, that is the truth on it:
This Town's abominable.

I still told ye John
Your whoring must come home; I counseled ye:
But where no grace is --

It Is none o'mine, man.

Answer the Parish so.

Cheated in troth.
Peeping into a house, by whom I know not,
Nor where to find the place again: no Fredricke,
Had I but kissed the ring fort; it is no poor one,
That Is my best comfort, for it has brought about it
Enough to make it man.

Where is it?

At home.

A saving voyage: But what will you say Signior,
To him that searching out your serious Worship,
Has met a stranger fortune?

How, good Frederick?
A militant girl now to this boy would hit it?

No, mine is a nobler venture: What do you think Sir
Of a distressed Lady, one whose beauty
Would oversell all Italy?

Where is she --

A woman of that rare behavior,
So qualified, as admiration
Dwells round about her: of that perfect spirit --

I marry Sir.

That admirable carriage,
That sweetness in discourse; young as the morning,
Her blushes staining his.

But where is this Creature?
Show me but that.

That Is all one, she is forth coming,
I have her sure Boy.

Hark ye Fredrick.
What truck betwixt my Infant?

It Is too light Sir,
Stick to your charges good Don John, I am well.

But is there such a wench?

First tell me this,
Did ye not lately as ye walked along,
Discover people that were armed, and likely
To do offense?

Yes mary, and they urged it
As far as they had spirit.

Pray go forward.

A Gentleman I found engaged amongst them,
It seems of noble breeding, I Am sure brave metal,
As I returned to look you, I set in to him,
And without hurt ( I thank heaven) rescued him,
And came my self off safe too.

My work's done then:
And now to satisfy you, there is a woman,
Oh John, there is a woman --

Oh, where is she?

And one of no less worth then I assure ye;
And which is more, fallen under my protection.

I am glad of that: forward sweet Fredrick.


And which is more then that, by this nights wandering,
And which is most of all, she is at home too Sir.

Come, lets be gone then.

Yes, but it is most certain,
You cannot see her, John.

Why?

She has sworn me
That none else shall come near her: not my Mother
Till some few doubts are cleared.

Not look upon her? What chamber is she in?

In ours.

Let Us go I say:
A woman's oaths are wafers, break with making,
They must for modesty a little: we all know it.

No, I Will assure you Sir.

Not see her?
I smell an old dog trick of yours, well Fredrick,
Ye talked to me of whoring, let us have fair play,
Square dealing I would wish ye.

When it is come.
Which I know never will be, to that issue,
Your spoone shall be as deep as mine Sir.

Tell me,
And tell me true, is the cause honorable,
Or for your ease?

By all our friendship, John,
It Is honest, and of great end.

I am answered:
But let me see her though: leave the door open
As ye go in.

I dare not.

Not wide open,
But just so, as a jealous husband
Would level at his wanton wife through.

That courtesy,
If ye desire no more, and keep it strictly,
I dare afford ye: come, it is now near morning.

Nay the old woman's gone too.

She Is a Catterwauling
Among the gutters: But conceive me, Peter,
Where our good Masters should be?

Where they should be,
I do conceive, but where they are, good Anthony --

I, there it goes: my Masters bo-peep with me,
With his slye popping in and out again,
Argued a cause, a frippery cause.

Believe me,
They bear up with some carvell.

I do believe thee,
For thou have such a Master for that chase,
That till he spend his maine Mast --

Pray remember
Your courtesy good Anthony; and withal,
How long it is since your Master sprung a leak,
He had a sound one since he came.

Hark.

What?

Do not hear a Lute?
Again?

Where is it?

Above in my Masters chamber.

There Is no creature: he has the key himself man.

This is his Lute: let him have it.


I grant you; but who strikes it?

An admirable voice too, hark ye.

Anthony,
Art sure we are at home?

Without all doubt, Peter.

Then this must be the Devil.

Let it be.
Good Devil sing again: O dainty devil,
Peter beleve it, a most delicate devil,
The sweetest Devil --

If ye could leave peeping.

I cannot by no means.

Then come in softly,
And as ye love your faith, presume no further
Then ye have promised.

Basto.

What make you up so early sir?

You sir in your contemplations.

O pray ye peace sir.

Why peace sir?

Do you hear?

It Is your Lute.

Pray ye speak softly.
She Is playing on it.

The house is haunted sir,
For this we have heard this half year.

Ye saw nothing;

Not I.

Nor I Sir.

Get us our breakfast then,
And make no words on it; we will undertake this spirit,
If it be one.

This is no devil Peter.
Mum, there be Bats abroad.

Stay, now she sings.

An Angels voice I Will swear.

Why did thou shrug so?
Either allay this heat; or as I live
I will not trust ye.

Pass: I warrant ye.

To curse those stars, that men say govern us,
To rail at fortune, fall out with my Fate,
And task the general world, will help me nothing:
Alas, I am the same still, neither are they
Subject to helps, or hurts: Our own desires
Are our own fates, our own stars, all our fortunes,
Which as we sway 'em, so abuse, or bless us.

Peace to your meditations.

Pox upon ye,
Stand out oth' light.

I crave your mercy sir,
My mind o're-charg'd with care made me unmannerly.

Pray ye set that mind at rest, all shall be perfect.

I like the body rare; a handsome body,
A wondrous handsome body: would she would turn:
See, and that spightfull puppy be not got
Between me and my light again,

It Is done,
As all that you command shall be: the gentleman
Is safely off all danger.

O de dios.

How shall I thank ye sir? how satisfy?

Speak softly, gentle Lady, all is rewarded,
Now does he melt like Marmalad.

Nay, it is certain,
Thou art the sweetest woman I e're looked on:
I hope thou art not honest.

None disturbed ye?

Not any sir, nor any sound came near me,
I thank your care.

It Is well.

I would feign pray now,
But the Devil and that flesh there, of the world,
What are we made to suffer?

He Will enter;
Pull in your head and be hanged.

Hark ye Fredricke,
I have brought ye home your Pack-saddle.

Pox upon ye.

Nay let him enter: fie my Lord the Duke,
Stand peeping at your friends.

Ye are cozened Lady,
Here is no Duke.

I know him full well Signior.

Hold thee there wench.

This mad-brain'd fool will spoil all.

I do beseech your grace come in.

My Grace,
There was a word of comfort.

Shall he enter,
Who e're he be?

Well followed Fredrick.

With all my heart.

Come in then.

'Blesse ye Lady:

Nay start not, though he be a stranger to ye,
He Is of a Noble strain, my kinsman, Lady,
My Countryman, and fellow Traveller,
One bed contains us ever, one purse feeds us,
And one faith free between us; do not fear him,
He Is truly honest.

That Is a lie.

And trusty:
Beyond your wishes: valiant to defend,
And modest to converse with, as your blushes.

Now may I hang my self; this commendation
Has broke the neck of all my hopes: for now
Must I cry, no forsooth, and I forsooth, and surely,
And truly as I live,, and as I am honest.
Has done these things for 'nonce too; for he knows,
Like a most envious Rascal as he is,
I am not honest, nor desire to be,
Especially this way: h'as watched his time,
But I shall quit him.

Sir, I credit ye.

Go kiss her John.

Plague of your commendations.

Sir, I shall now desire to be a trouble.

Never to me, sweet Lady: Thus I seal
My faith, and all my service.

One word Signeur.

Now it is impossible I should be honest,
She kisses with a conjuration
Would make the devil dance: what points she at?
My leg I warrant, or my well knit body:
Sit fast Don Fredrick.

'Twas given him by that gentleman
You took such care of; his own being lost in the scuffle.

With much joy may he wear it: it is a right one,
I can assure ye Gentleman, and right happy
May you be in all fights for that fair service.

Why do ye blush?

'T had almost cozened me,
For not to lie, when I saw that, I looked for
Another Master of it: but it is well.

Who Is there?
Stand ye a little close: Come in Sir,
Now what is the news with you?

There is a gentlemen without,
Would speak with Don John,

Who sir?

I do not know Sir, but he shows a man
Of no mean reckoning.

Let him show his name,
And then return a little wiser.

Well Sir.

How do you like her John?

As well as you Fredrick,
For all I am honest: you shall find it so too.

Art thou not honest?

Art thou an Ass?
And modest as her blushes? What a block-head
Would e're have popt out such a dry Apology,
For his dear friend? and to a Gentlewoman,
A woman of her youth, and delicacy.
They are arguments to draw them to abhor us.
An honest moral man; it is for a Constable:
A handsome man, a wholesome man, a tough man,
A liberal man, a likely man, a man
Made up like Hercules, unslak'd with service:
The same to night, to morrow night, the next night,
And so to perpetuity of pleasures,
These had been things to hearken too, things catching:
But you have such a spiced consideration,
Such qualmes upon your worships conscience,
Such-chil-blaines in your blood, that all things pinch ye,
Which nature, and the liberal world makes custom,
And nothing but fair honor, O sweet honor,
Hang up your Eunuch honor: That I was trusty,
And valiant, were things well put in; but modest!
A modest gentleman I o wit where wast thou?

I am sorry John,

My Ladies gentlewoman
Would laugh me to a Schoole-boy, make me blush
With playing with my Codpeece point: fie on thee,
A man of thy discretion?

It shall be mended:
And henceforth ye shall have your due.

I look fort: How now, who is it?

A gentleman of this town
And calls himself Petruchio.

I Will attend him.

How did he call himself.

Petruchio,
Does it concern you ought?

O gentlemen,
The hour of my destruction is come on me,
I am discovered, lost, left to my ruin:
As ever ye had pity --

Do not fear,
Let the great devil come, he shall come through me:
Lost here, and we about ye?

Fall before us?

O my unfortunate estate, all angers
Compared to his, to his --

Let his, and all men's,
Whilst we have power and life: stand up for heaven sake.

I have offended heaven too; yet heaven knows --

We are all evil:
Yet heaven forbid we should have our deserts.
What is a?

Too too near to my offense sir;
O he will cut me peece-meale.

It Is no Treason?

Let it be what it will: if a cut here,
I Will find him cut-worke.

He must buy you dear,
With more than common lives.

Fear not, nor weep not:
By heaven I Will fire the Town before ye perish,
And then, the more the merrier, we will jog with ye.

Come in, and dry your eyes.

Pray no more weeping:
Spoil a sweet face for nothing? my return
Shall end all this I warrant you.

Heaven grant it.

This man should be of special rank:
For these commends carry no common way,
No slight worth with 'em:
A shall be he.

'Save ye sir: I am sorry
My business was so unmannerly, to make ye
Wait thus long here.

Occasions must be served sir:
But is your name Don John?

It is Sir.

Then,
First, for your own brave sake I must embrace ye:
Next, from the credit of your noble friend
Hernando de Aluara, make ye mine:
Who lays his charge upon me in this Letter
To look ye out, and for the goodness in ye,
Whilst your occasions make ye resident
In this place, to supply ye, love and honor ye;
Which had I known sooner --

Noble sir,
You Will make my thanks too poor: I wear a sword, sir,
And have a service to be still disposed of,
As you shall please command it.

Gentle sir,
That manly courtesy is half my business:
And to be short, to make ye know I honor ye,
And in all points believe your worth like Oracle,
And how above my friends, which are not few,
And those not slack, I estimate your virtues,
Make your self understand, This day Petruchio,
A man that may command the strength of this place,
Hazard the boldest spirits; has made choice
Only of you, and in a noble office.

Forward, I am free to entertain it.

Thus then:
I do beseech ye mark me.

I shall do it.

Ferrara's Duke, would I might call him wort hie,
But that he has razed out from his family,
As he has mine with Infamy, This man,
Rather this powerful Monster, we being left
But two of all our house, to stock out memories,
My Sister, and my self; with arts, and witch-crafts,
Vows, and such oaths heaven has no mercy for,
Drew to dishonor this weak maid, by stealthes,
And secret passages I knew not of,
Often he obtained his wishes, often abused her:
I am ashamed to say the rest: This purchased,
And his hot blood allayed, as friends forsake us
At a miles end upon our way, he left her,
And all our name to ruin.

This was foul Play,
And ought to be rewarded so.

I hope so;
He escaped me yester-night: which if he dare
Again adventure for, heaven pardon him,
I shall with all my heart.

For me, brave Signior,
What do ye intend?

Only, fair sir, this trust,
Which from the commendations of this Letter,
I dare presume well placed, nobly to bear him
By word of mouth a single challenge from me,
That man to man, if he have honor in him,
We may decide all difference.

Fair, and noble,
And I will do it home: When shall I visit ye?

Please you this afternoon, I will ride with ye:
For at a Castle six mile hence, we are sure
To find him.

I Will be ready.

To attend ye,
My man shall wait: with all my

My service shall not fail ye.

How now?

All Is well: who do thou think this wench is?
Guess, and thou can?

I cannot.

Be it known then,
To all men by these presents, this is she,
She, she, and only she, our curious coxcombs
Were errant two months after.

Who, Constantia?
Thou talk of Cocks and Bulls.

I talk of wenches,
Of Cocks and Hens Don Frerdick; this is the Pullet
We two went proud after.

It cannot be.

It shall be;
Sister to Don Petruchio: I know all man.

Now I believe.

Go to, there has been stirring,
Fumbling with Linen Fredrick.

It Is impossible,
You know her feign was pure as fire.

That pure fire
Has melted out her maidenhead: she is crickt:
We have all that hope of our side, boy.

Thou tell me,
To my imagination, things incredible:
I see no loose thought in her.

That Is all one,
She is loose in the hilts by heaven: but the world must know
A fair way, upon vow of marriage.

There may be such a slip.

And will be Fredrick,
Whilst the old game's a foot: I fear the boy too
Will prove hers too I took up.

Good circumstance
May cure all this yet.

There thou hitst it, Fredrick:
Come, let us walk in and comfort her: her being here
Is nothing yet suspected: anon I Will tell thee
Wherefore her brother came, who by this light
Is a brave noble fellow, and what honor
H'as done to me a stranger: there be Irons
Heating for some, will histe into their heart bloods,
'Ere all be ended; so much for this time.

Well sir

CCome ye do know.

I do not by this hand Mistress.
But I suspect.

What?

That if eggs continue
At this price, women will never be saved
By their good works.

I will know.

Ye shall, any thing
Lies in my power: The Duke of Loraine now
Is seven thousand strong: I heard it of a fish-wife,
A woman of fine knowledge.

Sirrah, sirrah.

The Popes Bulls are broke loose too and it is suspected
They shall be baited in England.

Very well sir.

No, it is not so well neither.

But I say to ye,
Who is it keeps your Master company?

I say to you, Don John.

I say what woman?

I say so too.

I say again, I will know.

I say it is fit ye should.

And I tell thee
He has a woman here.

And I tell thee
It Is then the better for him.

You are no Bawd now?

Would I were able to be called unto it:
A worshipful vocation for my elders;
For as I understand it is a place
Fitting my betters far.

Was ever Gentlewoman
So frumpt off with a fool? well saucy sirrah,
I will know who it is, and for what purpose;
I pay the rent, and I will know how my house
Comes by these Inflammations: if this geere hold,
Best hang a signe-post up, to tell the Signiors,
Here ye may have lewdness at Liverie.

'Twould be a great ease to your age.

How now?
Why what is the matter Land-lady?

What Is the matter?
Ye use me decently among ye gentlemen.

Who has abused her, you sir?

'Ods my witness
I will not be thus treated, that I will not.

I gave her no ill language.

Thou lie lewdly,
Thou tookst me up at every word I spoke,
As I had been a Mawkin, a flurt Gillian;
And thou think, because thou can write and read,
Our noses must be under thee.

Dare you sirrah?

Let but the truth be known Sir, I beseech ye,
She raves of wenches, and I know not what sir:

Go to, thou know too well, thou wicked varlet,
Thou instrument of evil.

As I live Sir,
She is ever thus till dinner.

Get ye in,
I Will answer you anon sir.

By this hand
I Will break your Possit pan.

Then by this hood
I Will lock the meat up.

Now your grief, what is it?
For I can guess --

Ye may with shame enough,
If theer were shame amongst ye; nothing thought on,
But how ye may abuse my house: not satisfied
With bringing home your Bastards to undo me,
But you must drill your whores here too; my patience
Because I bear, and bear, and carry, all,
And as they say am willing to groan under)
Must be your make-sport now.

No more of these words.
Nor no more murmurings Lady: for you know
That I know something. I did suspect your anger,
But turn it presently and handsomely,
And bear your self discreetly to this woman,
For such a one there is indeed.

It Is well son.

Leaving your devils Matins, and your melanchollies,
Or we shall leave our lodgings.

You have much need
To use these vagrant ways, and to much profit:
Ye had that might content
(At home within your selves too) right good gentlemen,
Wholesome, and ye said handsome: But you gallants,
Boast that I was to believe ye --

Leave your suspicion:
For as I live there is no such thing.

Mine honor;
And 'twere not for mine honor.

Come, your honor,
Your house, and you too, if you dare believe me
Are well enough: sleek up your self, leave crying,
For I must have ye entertain this Lady
With all civility, she well deserves it,
Together with all secrecy: I dare trust ye,
For I have found ye faithful: when you know her
You will find your own fault; no more words, but do it.

You know you may command me.

Worshipful Lady,
How does thy Velvet scabbard? by this hand
Thou look most amiably: now could I willingly
And 'twere not for abusing thy Geneva print there,
Venture my body with thee.

You Will leave this roperie,
When you come to my years.

By this light
Thou art not above fifteen yet, a mere girl,
Thou have not half thy teeth: come --

Prithee John
Let her alone, she has been vexed already:
She Will grow stark mad man.

I would see her mad,
An old mad woman

Prithee be patient.

Is like a Millers Mare, troubled with toothache.
She Will make the rarest faces.

Go, and do it,
And do not mind this fellow.

Well Don John.
There will be times again; when O good Mother,
What Is good for a carnosity in the Bladder?
O the green water, mother.

Doting take ye,
Do ye remember that?

She has paid ye now sir.

Clarry, sweet mother, Clarry.

Are ye satisfied?

I Will never whore again; never give Petticoats
And Wastcoats at five pound a piece; good Mother,
Quickly Mother: now mock on Son.

A devil grind your old chaps.

By this hand wench
I Will give thee a new hood for this.
Has she met with your Lordship?
Touch-wood rake her.
She Is a rare ghostly mother.

Below attends ye
The Gentleman's man sir that was with ye.

Well Sir;
My time is come then: yet if my project hold,
You shall not stay behind: I Will rather trust.
A Cat with sweet milk Fredrick; by her face
I feel her fears are working.

Is there no way,
I do beseech ye think yet, to divert
This certain danger?

It Is impossible:
Their honors are engaged.

Then there must be murder,
Which, Gentlemen, I shall no sooner hear of,
Then make one int: you may, if you please sir,
Make all go less yet.

Lady were mine own cause,
I could dispense: but laden with my friends trust,
I must go on; though general massacres
As much I fear --

Do ye hear sir; for heavens pity
Let me request one love of you.

Yes any thing.

This gentleman I find too resolute,
Too hot, and fiery for the cause, as ever
You did a virtuous deed, for honors sake
Go with him, and allay him: your fair temper
And noble disposition, like wished showers,
May quench those eating fires, that would spoil all else.
I see in him destruction.

I will do it;
And it is a wise consideration,
To me, a bounteous favor: hark ye John,
I will go with ye.

No.

Indeed I will,
Ye go upon a hazard: no denial;
For as I live, I Will go.

Then make ye ready,
For I am straight a horseback.

My sword on,
I am as ready as you: what my best labor,
With all the Art I have can work upon 'em,
Be sure of, and expect fair end: the old gentlewoman
Shall wait upon you; she is both grave and private,
And ye may trust her in all points.

Ye are noble:
And so I kiss your hand.

That seal for me too,
And I hope happy issue Lady.

All heavens care upon ye, and my prayers.

So,
Now my mind's at rest.

Away, it is late John.

Come sir* be hearty: all the worst is past.

Give me some Wine.

It Is death Sir.

It Is a horse sir.
'Sbloud, to be dressed to the tune of Ale only,
Nothing but sawces to my sores.

Fie Antonio,
You must be governed.

Has given me a damned Glister,
Only of sand and snow water, gentlemen,
Has almost scoured my guts out.

I have given you that sir
Is fittest for your state.

And here he feeds me
With rotten ends of rooks, and drowned chickens,
Stewd Pericraniums, and Pia-maters;
And when I go to bed, by heaven it is true gentlemen,
He rolls me up in Lints, with Labels at 'em,
That I am just the man in the Almanac,
In head and face, is Aries place.

Wilt please ye
To let your friends see ye opened?

Will it please you sir
To let me have a wench: I feel my body
Open enough for that yet?

How, a wench?

Why look ye gentlemen; thus I am used still,
I can get nothing that I want.

Leave these things,
And let him open ye.

De'ye hear Surgeon?
Send for the Music, let me have some pleasure
To entertain my friends, beside your Sallads,
Your green salves, and your searches, and some wine too,
That I may only smell to it: or by this light
I Will dye upon thy hand, and spoil thy custom.

Let him have Music.

It Is in the house, and ready,
If he will ask no more: but wine --

He shall not drink it.

Will these things please ye?

Yes, and let 'em sing
John Dorrie.

It Is too long.

I Will have John Dorrie,
For to that warlike tune I will be opened.
Give me some drink, have ye stopped the leakes well Surgeon,
All will run out else?

Fear not.

Sit down Gentlemen:
And now advance your plasters.
Give 'em ten shillings friends: how do ye find me?
What Symptoms do you see now?

None Sir, dangerous:
But if you will be ruled --

What time?

I can cure ye
In forty days, so you will not transgress me.

I have a dog shall lick me whole in twenty:
In how long can thou kill me?

Presently.

Do it; there is more delight in it.

You must have patience.

Man, I must have business; this foolish fellow
Hinders himself: I have a dozen Rascals
To hurt within these five days: good man mender,
Stop me up with Parsley, like stuffed Beef,
And let me walk abroad.

Ye shall walk shortly.

For I must find Petruchio.

Time enough.

Come lead him in, and let him sleep: within these three days
We Will beg ye leave to play.

And then how things fall,
We Will certainly inform ye.

But Surgion promise me
I shall drink Wine then too.

A little tempered.

Nay, I Will no tempering Surgion,

Well, as't please ye,
So ye exceed not.

Farewell: and if ye find
The Mad slave, that thus slasht me, commend me to him,
And bid him keep his skin close.

Take your rest sir.

I have told ye all I can, and more then yet
Those Gentlemen know of me; ever trusting
Your Council and concealment: for to me
You seem a worthy woman; one of those
Are seldom found in our sex, wise and virtuous,
Direct me I beseech ye.

Ye say well Lady,
And hold ye to that point; for in these businesses
A woman's council that conceives the matter,
(Do ye mark me, that conceives the matter Lady)
Is worth ten men's engagements: She knows something'
And out of that can work like wax: when men
Are giddy-headed, either out of wine,
Or a more drunkenness, vain ostentation,
Discovering all: there is no more keep in 'em,
Then hold upon an Eeles tail: nay it is held fashion
To defame now all they can.

I, but these gentlemen --

Do not you trust to that: these gentlemen
Are as all Gentlemen of the same Barrel:
I, and the self same pickle too. Be it granted,
They have used ye with respect and fair behavior,
Yet since ye came: do you know what must follow?
They are Spaniards, Lady, Gennets of high mettle,
Things that will thrash the devil, or his dam,
Let 'em appear but cloven.

Now heaven bless me.

Mad Colts will court the wind: I know 'em Lady
To the least hair they have; and I tell you,
Old is I am, let but the pint pot bless 'em,
They Will offer to my years --

How?

Such rude gambolls --

To you?

I, and so handle me, that often I am forced
To fight of all four for my safety: there is the younger,
Don John, the arrantst Jack in all this City:
The other, time has blasted, yet he will stoop,
If not ore-flowne, and freely on the quarry;
Has been a Dragon in his days. Bur Tarmont,
Don Jenkin is the Devil himself, the Dog-dayes,
The most incomprehensible whore-master,
Twenty a night is nothing: Beggars, Broom-women,
And those so miserable, they look like famine,
Are all sweet Ladies in his drink.

He Is a handsome Gentleman.
Pity he should be master of such follies.

He Is never without a noise of Sirrenges
In's pocket, those proclaim him; birding pills,
Waters to cool his conscience, in small Viols;
With thousand such sufficient emblemes: the truth is,
Whose chastily he chops upon, he cares not.
He flies at all; Bastards upon my conscience,
He has now in making multitudes; The last night
He brought home one; I pity her that bore it,
But we are all weak vessels, some rich woman
(For wise I dare not call her) was the mother,
For it was hung with Jewels: the bearing cloth
No less then Crimson Velvet.

How?

It Is true Lady.

Was it a Boy too?

A brave Boy; deliberation
And judgment showed in's getting, as I Will say for him,
He Is as well paced for that sport --

May I see it?
For there is a neighbor of mine, a Gentlewoman,
Has had a late mischance, which willingly
I would know further of; now if you please
To be so courteous to me.

Ye shall see it:
But what do ye think of these men now ye know 'em,
And of the cause I told ye of? Be wise,
Ye may repent too late else; I but tell ye
For your own good, and as you will find it Lady.

I am advised.

No more words then; do that,
And instantly, I told ye of be ready:
Don John, I Will fit ye for your frumps,

I shall be:
But shall I see this Child?

Within this half hour,
Let Us in, and there think better; she that is wise,
Leapes at occasion first; the rest pay for it.

Sir, he is worth your knowledge; and a Gentleman
If I that so much love him, may commend him,
Of free and virtuous parts; and one, if soul play
Should fall upon us, for which fear I brought him,
Will not fly back for phillips.

Ye much honor me,
And once more I pronounce ye both mine.

Stay, what Troop
Is that below in the valley there?

Hawking I take ir.

They are so; it is the Duke, it is even he Gentlemen,
Sirrah, draw back the Horses till we call ye,
I know him by his company.

I think too
He bends up this way.

So he does.

Stand you still
Within that Covert till I call: you Fredrick,
By no means be not seen, unless they offer
To bring on odds upon us; he comes forward,
Here will I wait him fairly: to your Cabins.

I need no more instruct ye?

Fear me not,
I Will give it him, and boldly.

Feed the Hawks up,
We Will fly no more to day: O my blessed fortune,
Have I so fairly met the man!

Ye have Sir,
And him you know by this,

Sir all the honor,
And love --

I do beseech your Grace stay there,
(For I know you too now) that love and honor
I come not to receive; nor can you give it,
Till ye appear fair to the world; I must beseech ye
Dismiss your train a little.

Walk aside,
And out of hearing I command ye: Now Sir,

Last time we met, I was a friend.

And Nobly
You did a friends office: let your business
Be what it may, you must be still --

Your pardon,
Never a friend to him, cannot be friend
To his own honor.

In what have I transgressed it?
Ye make a bold breach at the first Sir.

Bolder,
You made that breach that let in infamy
And ruin, to surprise a noble stock.

Be plain Sir.

I will, and short;
Ye have wronged a Gentleman
Little behind your self, beyond all justice,
Beyond mediation of all friends.

The man, and manner of wrong?
John Petruchio,
The wrong, ye have whord his Sister.

What Is his will in it?

His will is to oppose you like a Gentleman,
And single, to decide all.

Now stay you Sir,
And hear me with the like belief: this Gentleman
His Sister that you named, it is true I have long loved,
Nor was that love lascivious, as he makes it;
As true, I have enjoyed her: no less truth
I have a child by her: But that she, or he,
Or any of that family are tainted
Suffer disgrace, or ruin, by my pleasures,
I wear a Sword to satisfy the world no,
And him in this cause when he please; for know Sir,
She is my wife, contracted before Heaven,
(Witness I owe more tie to, then her Brother)
Nor will I fly from that name, which long since
Had had the Churches approbation,
But for his jealous danger.

Sir, your pardon,
And all that was my anger, now my service.

Fair sir, I knew I should convert ye; had we
But that rough man herd now too --

And ye shall Sir
Whoa, hoa, hoo.

I hope ye have laid no Ambush?

Only friends.

My noble Brother welcome:
Come put your Anger off, we will have no fighting,
Unless you will maintain I am unworthy
To bear that name.

Do you speak this heartily?

upon my soul, and truly; the first Priest
Shall put you out of these doubts.

Now I love ye;
And I beseech you pardon my suspicions,
You are now more then a Brother, a brave friend too.

The good man's over-joyd

How now, how goes it?

Why, the man 'has his mare again, and all is well Fredrick,
The Duke professes freely he is her husband.

It Is a good hearing.

Yes, for modest Gentlemen.
I must present ye: may it please your Grace
To number this brave Gentleman, my friend
And noble kinsman, amongst those your servants.

O my brave friend! you shower your bounties on me
Amongst my best thoughts Signior, in which number
You being worthily disposed already,
May place your friend to honor me.

My love sir,
And where your Grace dares trust me, all my service.

Why? this is wondrcus happy: But now Brother,
Now comes the bitter to our sweet: Constantia.

Why, what of her?

Nor what, nor where, do I know?
Winged with her fears last night, beyond my knowledge,
She quit my house, but whether --

Let not that --

No more good Sir, I have heard too much.

Nay sink not,
She cannot be so lost.

Nor shall not Gentlemen;
Be free again, the Lady's found; that smile Sir,
Shows ye distruct your Servant.

I do beseech ye.

Ye shall believe me: by my soul she is safe.

Heaven knows, I would believe Sir.

Ye may safely.

And under noble usage: this fair Gentleman
Met her in all her doubts last night, and to his guard
(Her fears being strong upon her) she gave her person,
who waited on her, to our lodging; where all respect,
Civil and honest service now attend her.

Ye may believe now.

Yes, I do, and strongly:
Well my good friends, or rather my good Angels,
For ye have both preserved me; when these virtues
Dye in your friends remembrance --

Good your grace
Lose no more time in complement, it is too precious,
I know it by my self, there can be no hell
To his that hangs upon his hopes; especially
In way of lustly pleasures.

He has hit it.

To horse again then, for this night I Will crown
With all the joys ye wish for.

Happy Gentlemen.

This is the maddest mischief: never fool
Was so fubd off, as I am; made ridiculous,
And to my self, mine own Ass: trust a woman,
I Will trust the Devil first; for he dare be
Better then is word sometime: what faith have I broke?
In what observance failed? Let me consider,
For this is monstrous usage.

Let them talk,
We Will ride on fair and softly.

Well Constantia,

Constantia, what is this fellow? stay by all means.


Ye have spun your self a fair thread now.

Stand still John.

What cause had you to fly? what fear possessed ye?
Were you not safely lodged from all suspicion?
Used with all gentle means? did any know
How ye came thither, or what your sin was.

John.
smell some juggling John.

Yes, Fredricks, I fear it will be found so.

So strangely,
Without the counsel of your friends; so desperately
To put all dangers on ye?

It Is she.

So deceitfully
After a strangers lure?

Did ye mark that Fredrick?

To make ye appear more monster; and the Law
More cruel to reward ye? to leave all,
All that should be your safeguard, to seek evils?
Was this your wisdom? this your promise? well
He that incited ye --

Mark that too.

Yes Sir.

'Had better have plough'd farther off; now Lady,
What will your last friend, he that should preserve ye,
And hold your credit up, the brave Antonio,
Think of this slip? he will to Petruchio,
And call for open justice.

It Is she Fredrick.

But what that he is John.

I do not doubt yet
To bolt ye out, for I know certainly
Ye are about the Town still: ha, no more words.

Well.

Very well.

Discreetly.

Finely carried.

You have no more of these tricks?

Ten to one Sir,
I shall meet with 'em if ye have.

Is this honest?

Was it in you a friends part to deal double?
I am no ass Don Fredrick.

And Don John,
It shall appear I am no fool;
Disgrace me to make yourselfe a lecher?
It Is boyish, it is base.

It Is false, and most unmanly to upbraid me,
Nor will I be your boister Sir,

Thou wanton boy, thou had better have been Eunuch,
Thou common woman's courtesy, then thus
Lascivious, basely to have bent mine honor.
A friend? I Will make a horse my friend first!

Holla, holla,
Ye kick to fast sir: what strange brains have you got,
That dare crow out thus bravely? I better been a Eunuch?
I privy to this dog trick? clear your self,
For I know where the wind sits, and most nobly,
Or as I have a life --

No more: they are horses.
Nor show no discontent: to morrow comes;
Let Us quietly away: if she be at home,
Our jealousies are put off.

The fellow
We have lost him in our spleenes, like fools.

Come Gentlemen,
Now set on roundly; suppose ye have all mistresses,
And mend your pace according,

Then have at ye.

NOw to Bollonia, my most honored brother,
I dare pronounce yea hearty, and safe welcome,
Our loves shall now way-lay ye; welcome Gentlemen.

The same to you brave Sir; Don Fredrick
Will ye step in, and give the Lady notice
Who comes to honor her?

Bid her be sudden,
We come to see no curious wench: a night-gowne
Will serve the turn: here is one that knows her nearer.

I Will tell her what ye say Sir.

My dear brother,
Ye are a merry Gentleman.

Now will the sport be
To observe her alterations; how like wildfire
She Will leap into your bosom; then seeing me,
Her conscience, and her fears creeping upon her
Dead as a foul at souse, she will sink.

Fair brother,
I must entreat you --

I conceive your mind Sir,
I will not chide her: yet ten ducats Duke,
She falls upon he knees, ten more she dare not --

I must not have her frighted.

Well you shall not:
But like a summers evening against heat,
Mark how I Will guild he cheeks?

How now.

Ye may Sir:
Not to abuse your patience, noble friends,
Nor hold ye off with tedious circumstance,
For you must know, --

What?

Where is she?

Gone Sir.

How?

What did you say Sir?

Gone, by heaven removed,
The woman of the house too.

Well Don Fredrick.

Don John, it is not well, but --

Gone?

This fellow
Can testify I lie not.

Some four hours after
My Master was departed with this Gentleman,
My fellow and my self, being sent of business,
(As we must think) of purpose --

Hang these circumstances,
They appear like owls, to ill ends.

Now could I eat
The devil in his own broth, I am so tortured.
Gone?

Gone?

Directly gone, fled, shifted: what would you have me say?


Well Gentlemen,
Wrong not my good opinion.

For your Dukedom
I will not be a knave Sir.

He that is
A rot run in his blood.

But hark ye Gentlemen,
Are ye sure ye had her here, did ye not dream this.

Have you your nose Sir?

Yes Sir.

Then we had her.

Since you are so short, believe your having her
Shall suffer more construction.

Let it suffer,
But if I be not clear of all dishonor,
Or practice that may taint my reputation,
And ignorant of where this woman is,
Make me your Cities monster.

I believe ye.

I could lie with a witch now, to be revenged
Upon that Rascal did this.

Only thus much
I would desire your Grace, for my mind gives me
Before night yet she is yours: stop all opinion,
And let no anger out, till full cause call it,
Then every man's own work's to justify him,
And this day let us give to search: my man here
Tells me, by chance he saw out of a window
(Which place he has taken note of) such a face
As our old Landladies, he believes the same too,
And by her hood assures it: Let Us first thither,
For she being found, all is ended.

Come, for heavens sake,
And Fortune, and thou be not ever turning,
If there be one firm step in all thy reelings,
Now settle it, and save my hopes: away friends.

With all my jewels?

All Sir.

And that money
I left in the trunk?

The Trunk broke, and that gone too.

Franscisco of the plot?

Gone with the wench too.

The mighty pox go with 'em: belike they thought
I was no man of this world, and those trifles
Would but disturb my conscience.

Sure they thought Sir,
You would not live to persecute 'em.

Whore and Fiddler,
Why, what a consort have they made? Hen and bacon?
Well my sweet Mistress, well good Madam martaile?
You that have hung about my neck, and lick't me,
I Will try how handsomely your Ladyship
Can hang upon a Gallows, there is your Masterpiece;
But hark ye Sirrah, no imagition
Of where they should be?

None Sir, yet we have searched
All places we suspected; I believe Sir,
They have taken toward the Ports.

Get me a conjurer,
One that can raise a water devil, I Will port 'em;
Play at duck and drake with my money? take heed Fiddler;
I Will dance ye by this hand, your Fidle-sticke
I Will grease of a new fashion, for presuming
To meddle with my degamboys: get me a Conjurer,
Enquire me out a man that lets out devils:
None but my C. Cliffe serve your turn?

I know not --

In every street, Tom fool, any bleare-eyd people
With red heads, and flat noses can perform it;
Thou shall know 'em by their half gowns and no breeches:
Mount my mare Fiddler? ha boy? up at first dash?
Sit sure, I Will clap a nettle, and a smart one,
Shall make your filly firck: I will find Fidier,
I Will put you to your plundge boy: Sirrah meet me
Some two hours hence at home; In the mean time
Find out a conjurer and know his price,
How he will let his devils by the day out,
I Will have 'em, and they be above ground.

Now bless me,
What a mad man is this? I must do something
To please his humor: such a man I Will ask for,
And tell him where he is: but to come near him,
Or have any thing to do with his don devils,
I thank my fear, I dare not, nor I will not.

Whether will thou lead us?

It Is hard by sir.
And ten to one this wine goes thither.

Forward.

Are they grown so merry.

It Is most likely
She has heard of this good fortune, and determines
To wash her sorrows off.

It Is so; that house sir
Is it: out of that window certainly
I saw my old Mistrisses face.

They are merry indeed,
Hark I here Music too.

Excellent Music.

Would I were even among 'em and alone how,
A pallat for the purpose in a corner,
And good rich wine within me; what gay sport
Could I make in an hour now?

Hark a voice too;
Let Us not stir yet by any means.

Was this her own voice?

Yes sure.

It Is a rare one.

The Song confirms her here too: for if ye mark it,
It spoke of liberty, and free enjoying
The happy end of pleasure.

Look ye there sir,
Do ye know that head?

It Is my good Landlady,
I find fear has done all this.

She I swear,
And now do I know by the hanging of her hood,
She is parcel drunk: shall we go in?

Not yet Sir.

No, let 'em take their pleasure,

When it is highest,
We Will step in, and amaze 'em: peace more Music.

This Music murders me; what blood have I now?

I should know that face.


By this light it is he Fredricks,
That bred our first suspicions, the same fellow.

He that we overtooke, and overheard too
Discoursing of Constantia.

Still the same;
Now he slips in.

What Is that?

She must be here Sir:
This is the very fellow, I told your Grace
We found upon the way; and what his talk was.

Why, sure I know this fellow; yes, it is he,
Francisco, Antonio's Boy, a rare Musician,
He taught my Sister on the Lute, and is ever
(She loves his voice so well) about her: certain,
Without all doubt she is here: it must be so.

Here? that is no question: what should our hen o'th game else
Do here without her? if she be not here
(I am so confident) let your Grace believe,
We two are arrant Rascals, and have abused ye.

I say so too.

Why there is the hood again now,
The guard that guides us; I know the fabric of it.
And know the old tree of that saddle yet, 'twas made of
A hunting hood, observe it.

Who shall enter?

I Will make one.

I, another.

But so carry it,
That all her joys flow not together.

If we told her,
Your Grace would none of her?

By no means Signior,
'Twould turn her wild, stark frantic.

Or assured her --

Nothing of that? starve nature? this ye may sir.
That the conditions of our fear yet stand
On nyce and dangerous knittings: or that a little
I seem to doubt the child.

Would I could draw her
To hate your Grace with these things.

Come let us enter,
And now he sees me not, I Will search her soundly.

Now luck of all sides.

Doubt it not: more Music:
Sure she has heard some comfort.

Yes, stand still sir.

This is the maddest song.

Applied for certain
To some strange mellancholly she is laden with.

Now all the sport begins -- hark?

They are amongst'em,
The fears now, and the shakings?

Our old Lady
(Hark how they run) is even now at this instant
Ready to loose her head piece by Don John,
Or creeping through a Cat hole.

Bring 'em down,
And you sir, follow me.

He Is angry with 'em,
I must not suffer this.
Bowl down the Bawd there
Old Erra matter: you Lady leachery
For the good will I bear to the game, most tenderly
Shall be lead out, and lashed.

Is this Constantia?
Why Gentlemen? what do you mean? is this she?

I am Constantia sir.

A Whore ye are sir.

It Is very true: I am a Whore indeed sir.

She will not lie yet, though she steal.

A plain whore,
If you please to employ me.

And an impudent --

Plain dealing now is impudence.
One if you will sir, can show ye as much sport
In one half hour, and with as much variety,
As a far wiser woman can in half a year:
For there my way lies.

Is she not drunk too?

A little gilded over sir,
Old sack, old sack boys.

This is saliant.

A brave bold queen.

Is this your certainty?
Do ye know the man ye wrong thus, Gentlemen?
Is this the woman meant?

No.

That your Landlady?

I know not what to say.

Am I a person
To be your sport Gentlemen?

I do believe now certain
I am a knave; but how, or when --

What are you?

Bawd to this piece of pie meat.

A poor Gentlewoman
That lies in Town, about Law business,
And't like your worships.

You shall have Law, believe it.

I Will show your mastership my case.

By no means,
I had rather see a Custard.

My dead husband
Left it even thus sir.

Bless mine eyes from blasting,
I was never so frighted with a case.

And so sir --

Enough, put up good velvet head.

What are you two now,
By your own free confessions?

What you shall think us,
Though to my self I am certain, and my life
Shall make that good and perfect, or fall with it.

We are sure of nothing (Fred) that is the truth on it:
I do not think my nam's Don John, nor dare not
Believe any thing that concerns me, but my debts,
Nor those in way of payment: things are so carried,
What to entreat your Grace, or how to tell ye
We are, or we are not, is past my cunning,
But I would feign imagine we are honost,
And of my conscience, I should fight in it --

Thus then,
For we may be all abused.

It Is possible,
For how should this concern them?

Here let us part --
Until to morrow this time: we to our way,
To make this doubt out, and you to your way;
Pawning our honors then to meet again,
When if she be not found.

We stand engaged
To answer any worthy way we are called to.

We ask no more.

Ye have done with us then?

No Dame.

But is her name Constantia?

Yes a moveable
Belonging to a friend of mine: come out Fiddler,
What say you to this Lady; be not fearful?

Saving the reverence of my Masters pleasure,
I say she is a whore, and that she has robbed him,
Hoping his hurts would kill him.

Who provoked me?
Nay sirrah squeak, I Will see your treble strings
Tied up too; if I hang, I Will spoil your piping,
Your sweet face shall not save ye.

Thou damned impudence,
And thou dried devil; where is the Officer?

He Is here sir.

Lodge these safe till I send for 'em;
Let none come to 'em, nor no noise be heard
Of where they are, or why: away.

By this hand
A handsome whore: Now will I be arrested,
And brought home to this officers: a stout whore,
I love such stirring ware: pox of this business,
A man must haunt out morsells for another,
And starve himself: a quick-ey'd whore, that is wildfire,
And makes the blood dance through the veins like billows.
I will reprive this whore.

Well, good luck with ye.

As much attend your Grace.

To morrow certain --

If we outlive this night sir.

Come Don John,
We have something now to do.

I am sure I would have.

If she be not found, we must fight.

I am glad on it,
I have not fought a great while.

If we dye --

There Is so much money saved in lechery.


IT should be here abouts.

Your grace is right,
This is the house I know it.

Grace?

It Is further
By the description we received.

Good my Lord the Duke,
Believe me, for I know it certainly,
This is the very house.

My Lord the Duke?

Pray heaven this man Prove right now.

Believe it, he is a most sufficient Scholar,
And can do rare tricks this way; for a figure,
Or raising an appearance, whole Christendom
Has not a better; I have heard strange wonders of him.

But can he show us where she is?

Most certain,
And for what cause too she departed.

Knock then,
For I am great with expectation,
Till this man satisfy me: I fear the Spaniards,
Yet they appear brave fellows: can he tell us?

With a wet finger, whether they be false.

Away then.

Who Is within here?

Your Grace may enter.

How can he know me?

He knows all.

And you sir.

What do you call his name?

Why, Peter Vechio.

They say he can raise devils,
Can he make 'em
Tell truth too, when he has raised 'em? for believe it,
These devils are the lyingst Rascals.

He can compel 'em.

With what? can he
Tie squibs in their tails, and fire the truth out?
Or make 'em eat a bawling Puritan,
Whose sanctified zeal shall rumble like an Earthquake?

With Spells man?

I with spoones as soon, do thou think
The devil such an Ass as people make him?
Such a poor coxcomb? such a penny foot post?
Compelled with cross and pile to run of errands?
With Asteroth, and Behemoth, and Belfagor?
Why should he shake at sounds, that lives in a smiths forg?
Or if he do --

Without all doubt he does John.

Why should not Bilbo raise him, or a pair of bullyons,
They go as big as any? or an unshod Car,
When he goes tumble, tumble over the stones,
Like Anacreons drunken verses, make us tremble?
These make as fell a noise; me thinks the colic
Well handled, and fed with small beer --

It Is the virtue --

The virtue? nay, and goodness fetch him up once,
Has lost a friend of me; the wise old Gentleman
Knows when, and how; I Will lay this hand to two pence,
Let all tho Conjurers in Christendom,
With all their spells, and virtues call upon him,
And I but think upon a wench, and follow it,
He shall be sooner mine then theirs; where is virtue?

Thou art the most sufficient, (I Will say for thee)
Not to believe a thing --

O sir, slow credit
Is the best child of knowledge; I Will go with ye,
And if he can do any thing, I Will think
As you would have me.

Let Us enquire a long,
For certain we are not far off.

Nor much nearer.

You lost her yesternight.

How think you sir?

Is your name Vechio?

Yes sir.

And you can show me
These; things you promise.

Your graces word bound to me,
No hand of Law shall seize me.

As I live sir --

And as I live, that can do something too sir.

I take your promises: stay here a little,
Till I prepare some Ceremonies, and I Will satisfy ye.
The Ladies name's Constantia?

Yes

I come straight.

Sure he is a learned man.

The most now living;
Did your grace mark when we told all these circumstances,
How ever and anon he bolted from us
To use his studies help?

Now I think rather
To talk with some familiar.

Not unlikely,
For sure he has 'em subject.

How could he else
Tell when she went, and who went with her?

True.

Or hit upon mine honor: or assure me
The Lady loved me dearly?

'Twas so.

Now,
I do beseech your Grace sit down, and you sir;
Nay pray sit close like brothers.

A rare fellow.

And what ye see, stir not at, nor use a word,
Until I ask ye; for what shall appear
Is but weak apparition and thin air
Not to be held, nor spoken too.

We are counseled --

What noise is that without there?

We must speak with him.

He Is busy Gentlemen.

That Is all one friend,
We must, and will speak with him.

Let 'em in sir,
We know their tongues and business, it is our own,
And in this very cause that we now come for,
They also come to be instructed.

Let 'em in then:
Sit down, I know your meaning.

The Duke before us,
Now we shall sure know something.

Not a question,
But make your eyes, your tongues --

This is a strange jugler,
Neither indent before hand for his payment,
Nor know the breadth of the business; sure his devell
Comes out of Lapland were they sell men winds,
For dead drink, and old doublets.

Peace, he conjures.

Let him, he cannot raise my devil.

Prithee peace.

Appear, appear,
And you soft winds so clear,
That dance upon the leaves, and make them sing
Gentle love-layes to the Spring,
Gilding all the vales below
With your verdure as ye blow,
Raise these forms from under ground
With a soft and happy sound.

This is an honest Conjurer, and a pretty Poet;
I like his words well, there is no bumbast in 'em,
But do you think now, he can cudgel up the devil,
With this short staff of Verses?

Peace the spirits --


Nay, and they be no worse --

Do ye know these faces?

No.

Sit still upon your lives then: and mark what follows:
Away, away.

These devils do not paint sure?
Have they no sweeter shapes in hell?

Hark now John.

I marry, this moves something like, this devil
Carries some metal in her gate.

I find ye,
You would see her face unvailed?

Yes.

Be uncovered.

O heaven!

Peace.

See how she blushes.

Fredrick,
This devil for my money; this is she Boy,
Why thou shake? I burn.

Sit still, and silent.

She looks back at me; now she smiles sir.

Silence.

I must rise, or burst.

Ye see what follows --

O gentle sir this shape again.

I cannot,
It Is all disolv'd again: this was the figure.

The very same sir.

No hope once more to see it?

You might have kept it longer, had ye spared it,
Now it is impossible.

No means to find it?

Yes that there is: sit still a while, there is wine
To thaw the wonder from your hearts: drink well sir.

This Conjurer is a right good fellow too,
A lad of mettle; two such devils more
Would make me a Conjurer: what wine is it?

Hollock.

The devil's in it then, look how it dances?
Well, if I be --

We are all before ye,
That Is your best comfort sir.

Byth' mas brave wine;
Nay, and the Devils live in this hell, I dare venture
Within these two months yet to be delivered
Of a large legion of 'em.

Here 'a comes,
Silence of all sides Gentlemen.

Good your grace,
Observe a stricter temper, and you too gallants,
You Will be deluded all else. This merry devil
That next appears, for such a one you will find it,
Must be called up by a strange incantation,
A Song, and I must sing it: pray bear with me,
And pardon my rude pipe; for yet ere parting
Twenty to one I please ye.

We are armed Sir.

Nor shall you see us more transgress.

What think thou
Now John?

Why, now do I think Fredrick,
(And it I think amiss heaven pardon me,)
This honest Conjurer, with some four or five
Of his good fellow devils, and my self,
Shall be yet drunk ere midnight.

Peace, he conjures.

Why, this is the Song Fredrick: twenty pound now
To see but our Don Gillian.

Peace it appears.

I cannot peace: devils in French hoods Fredrick?
Satan's old Siringes?

What Is this?

Peace.

She, Boy.

What do thou mean?

She, Boy, I say.

Ha?

She, boy.
The very child too Fredrick;

She laughes on us
Aloud John, has the devil these affections?
I do believe it is she indeed.

Stand still.

I will not;
Who calls Jeronimo from his naked bed?
Sweet Lady, was it you? If thou be the devil,
First, having crossed my self, to keep out wildfire,
Then said some special prayers to defend me
Against thy most unhallowed hood: have at thee.

Hold sir, I am no devil.

That Is all one.

I am your very Landlady.

I defy thee:
Thus as St. Dunstan blew the devils nose
With a pair of tongs, even so right worshipful --

Sweet son, I am old Gillion.

This is no spirit.

Art thou old Gillian, flesh and bone?

I am Son.

Sit still sir, now I Will show you all.


Where Is thy bottle?

Here, I beseech ye son --

For I know the devil
Cannot assume that shape.

It Is she John, certain --

A hogs pox o'your moldy chaps, what make you
Tumbling and juggling here?

I am quit now Signior,
For all the prankes you played, and railings at me,
For to tell true, out of a trick I put
Upon your high behaviors, which was a lie,
But then it served my turn, I drew the Lady
Unto my kinsmans here, only to torture
Your Don-ships for a day or two; and secure her
Out of all thoughts of danger: here she comes now.

May I yet speak?

Yes, and embrace her too,
For one that loves you deerer --

O my sweetest.

Blush not, I will not chide ye.

To add more
Unto the joy I know, I bring ye, see sir,
The happy fruit of all our vows.

Heavens blessing
Be round about thee ever.

Pray bless me to,
For if your grace be well instructed this way,
You Will find the keeping half the getting.

How sir?

I Will tell ye that anon.

It Is true this Gentleman
'Has done a charity worthy your favor,
And let him have it dear sir.

My best Lady
She has, and ever shall have: so must you sir,
To whom I am equal bound, as to my being.

Your Graces humble servants --

Why kneel you sir?

For pardon for my boldness: yet 'twas harmless
And all the art I have sir; those your grace saw
Which you thought spirits, were my neighbors children
Whom I instruct in Grammar, here, and Music;
Their shapes, the peoples fond opinions,
Believing I can conjure, and often repairing
To know of things stolen from 'em, I keep about me,
And always have in readiness; by conjecture
Out of their own confessions, I often tell 'em
Things, that by chance have fallen out so: which way
(Having the persons here, I knew you sought for)
I wrought upon your grace: my end is mirth,
And pleasing, if I can, all parties.

I believe it,
For you have pleased me truly: so well pleased me,
That when I shall forget it --

Here Is old Antonio,
I spide him at a window, coming mainely
I know about his whore, the man you light on,
As yon discovered unto me: good your Grace,
Let Us stand by all, 'twill be a mirth above all,
To observe his pelting fury.

About a wench sir?

A young whore that has robbed him,

But do you know sir,
Where she is?

Yes, and will make that perfect --

I am instructed well then.

If he come
To have a devil showed him, by all means
Let me be he, I can rore rarely.

Be so,
But take heed to his anger.

Slip in quickly,
There you shall find suites of all sorts: when I call,
Be ready and come forward.
Who Is there come in?

Are you the Conjurer?

Sir I can do a little
That way, if you please to employ me.

Presently show me a devil that can tell --

Where your wench is.

You are i'th'right; as also where the Fiddler
That was consenting to her.

Sit ye there sir,
Ye shall know presently: can ye pray heartily?

Why, is your devil so furious?

I must show ye
A form, may chance affright ye.

He must fart fire then:
Take you no care for me.

Ascend Asterth,
Why, when, appear I say -- Now question him.

Where is my whore Don devil?

Gone to China,
To be the great Chams Mistress.

That Is a lie devil:
Where are my jewels?

Pawned for Peticoates.

That may be; where is the Fiddler?

Condemned to the Gallows,
For robbing of a Mill.

The lyingst devil
That e're I dealt withal, and the unlikeliest:
What was that Rascal hurt me?

I.

How?

I.

Who was he?

I.

Do ye here conjurer,
Dare you venture your devil?

Yes.

Then I Will venture my dagger;
Have at your devils pate; do ye mew?

Hold.

Hold there,
I do command ye hold.

Is this the devil?
Why Conjurer --

'Has been a devil to you sir.
But now you shall forget all: your whores safe,
And all your Jewels: your Boy too.

Now the devil indeed
Lay his ten claws upon thee, for my pate
Finds what it is to be a fend.

All safe?

Pray ye know this person: all is right now.

Your grace
May now command me then: but where is my whore?

Ready to go to whiping.

My whore whipped?

Yes, your whore without doubt Sir.

Whipped? pray Gentlemen.

Why, would you have her once more rob ye? the young boy
You may forgive, he was enticed.

The Whore sir,
Would rather carry pity: a hansome Whore.

A Gentleman I warrant thee.

Let Us in all.
And if we see contrition in your whore sir,
Much may be done.

Now my dear fair, to you,
And the full consummation of my Vow.
