Captain, Regent, Principal,


What shall I call thee?
The Noble spark of bounty;
The life-bloud of Society.

Call me your Forecast, you whoresons, when you come drunk out of a Tavern,
it is I must cast your plots into form still; it is I must manage the Pranck, or
I Will not give a louse for the proceeding: I must let fly my civil fortunes,
turn wilde-braine, lay my wits vpo'th Tenters, you raskals, to maintain a
company of villains, whom I love in my very soul and conscience


A ha, our little forecast.


Hang you, you have bewitched me among you, I was as well given till I fell to
be wicked, my Grandsire had hope of me, I went all in black, swore but a
Sundaies, never came home drunk, but upon fasting nights to cleanse my
stomach; sl'id now I Am quite altered, blown into light colors, let out
oaths by the minute, sit up late till it be early, drink drunk till I am
sober, sincke down dead in a Tavern, and rise in a Tabacco-shop: here is a
transformation: I was wont yet to pity the simple, and leave them some money:
sl'id, now I gull them without conscience; I go without order, swear without
number, gull without mercy, and drink without measure


I deny the last, for if you drink nere so much, you drink within measure.


How prove you that sir?


Because the drawers never fill their pots.


Masle that was well found out all drunkerds may lawfully say, they drink
within measure by that trick, dna now I Am put in the mind of a trick can you
keep your countenance villains? yet I am a fool to ask that, for how can
they keep their countenance that have lost their credits


I warrant you for blushing Captain.


I easily believe that Ancient, for thou lost thy colors once; Nay faith as
for blushing, I think there is grace little enough amongst you all, it is lent in
your cheeks, the flag's down; well, your blushing face I suspect not, nor
indeed greatly your laughing-face, unless you had more money in your purses:
then thus compendiously now, you all know the possibilities of my hereafter
fortunes, and the humor of my frolike Grandsire Sir Bounteous Progress; whose
death makes all possible to me: I shall have all, when he has nothing; but now
he has all, I shall have nothing: I think one mind runs through a million
of them; they love to keep us sober all the while the're alive, that when
the're dead we may drink to their healths; they cannot abide to see us merry
all the while the're above ground; and that makes so many laugh at their
fathers funerals: I know my Grandsire has his Will in a Box, and has
bequeathed all to me, when he can carry nothing away; but stood I in need of
poor ten pounds now, by his will I should hang my selte e're I should get
it, there is no such word in his Will I warrant you, nor no such thought in his
mind


You may build upon that Captain.


Then since he has no will to do me good as long as he lives; by mine own
will, I Will do my self good before he dies, and now I arrive at the purpose.
You are not ignorant I Am sure, you true and necessary implements of mischief;
first, that my Grandsier Sir Bounteous Progress is a Knight of thousands, and
therefore no Knight since one thousand six hundred: next, that he keeps a
house like his name Bounteous, open for all comers: thirdly and lastly, that
he stands much upon the glory of his complement, variety of entertainment,
together with the largenes of his Kitchen, longitude of his Buttery, and
fecunditie of his Larder, and thinks himself never happier then when some
stiff L. or great Countess alights, to make light his dishes: these being
well mixed together may give my project better encouragement, and make my
purpose spring forth more fortunate: to be short, and cut off a great deal of
durty way; I Will down to my Grandsire like a L


How Captain?


A French ruff, a thin beard, and a strong perfume will do it: I can hire
blew coats for you all by Westminster clock, and that color will be soonest
believed


But prithee Captain?


Push, I reach past your fadomes; you desire crowns.


From the crown of our head, to the sole of our foot bully.


Why carry your selves but probably, and carry away enough with your selves.


Why there spoke a Roman Captain, M. Penitent Brothell.


Sweet M. Folly-wit..

Here Is a mad brain a'th first, whose prankes scorn to have presidents; to be
second to any; or walk beneath any: madcaps inventions, has played more tricks
then the cards can allow a man, and of the last stamp too, hating imitation,
a fellow, whose only glory is to be prime of the company; to be sure of which,
he maintains all the rest: he is the Karion, and they the Kytes that gorge
upon him

But why in others do I check wild passions,
And retain deadly follies in my self?
I tax his youth of common received riot,
Times Comicke flashes, and the fruits of blood;
And in my self sooth up adulterous motions,
And such an appetite that I know dams me,
Yet willingly embrace it, love to Harebraines wife,
Over whose hours and pleasures her sick husband
With a fantastic but deserud suspect,
Bestows his serious time in watch and ward;
And therefore I Am constraind to use the means
Of one that knows no mean, a Curtizan,
One poison for another, whom her husband
Without suspicion innocently admits
Into her company, who with tried art
Corrupts and loosens her most constant powers,
Making his ielousy more then half a wittoll,
Before his face plotting his own abuse,
To which himself gives aim.
Whilst the broad arrowe with the forked head
Misses his browe but narrowly; see here she comes,
The close Curtizan, whose mother is her bawd.

Master Penitent Brothell.


My little pretty Lady gull-man, the news, the comfort?


You Are the fortunate man sir, Knight a'th holland skirt: there wants but
opportunity and she is wax of your own fashioning, she had wrought her self
into the form of your love before my art set finger to her


Did our affections meet? our thoughts keep time?


So it should seem by the music, the only jar is in the grumbling base
violl her husband


Oh his waking suspicion!


Sigh not M. Penitent, trust the managing of the business with me, it is for my
credit now to see it well finished: if I do you no good sir, you shall give me
no money sir


I am arrived at the Court of conscience; A Curtizan! O admirable times!
honesty is removed to the Common place. Farewell Lady


How now daughter?


What news mother?


A token from thy keeper.


Oh from sir Bounteous Progress: he is my keeper in deed, but there is many a
piece of venison stolen that my keeper wots not on; there is no park kept so
warily, but looses flesh one time or other; and no woman kept so privately, but
may watch advantage to make the best of her pleasure: and in common reason one
keeper cannot be enough for so proud a park as a woman


Hold thee there girl.


Fear not me mother.


Every part of the world shootes up daily into more subtilty: the very spider
weaues her caules with more art and cunning, to entrap the fly

The shallow ploughman can distinguish now,
Twixt simple truth and a dissembling browe.
Your base mechanic fellow can spy out
A weakness in a L. and learnes to floute.
How do behooue us then that live by sleight,
To have our wits wound up to their stretched height?
Fifteen times thou know I have sold thy may denhead,
To make up a dowry for thy marriage, and yet
There Is may denhead enough for old sir Bounteous still,
Heel be all his life time about it yet, and be as far to seek when he has
done
The sums that I have told upon thy pillow!
I shall once see those golden days again:
Tho fifteen, all thy may den heads are not gone:
The Italian is not serude yet, nor the French:
The British men come for a dozen at once,
They ingrosse all the market, Tut my girl,
It Is nothing but a politic conueyance;
A sincere carriage, a religious eyebrowe
That throws their charms over the worldlings senses;
And when thou spiest a fool that truly pities
The false springs of thine eyes,
And honorably doates upon thy love,
If he be rich, set him by for a husband;
Be wisely tempered and learn this my wench
Who gets the opinion for a virtuous name
May sin at pleasure, and nere think of shame:

Mother I am too deep a Scholar grown To learn my first rules now.


It Will be thy own, I say no more; peace, hark, remove thy self, oh, the two
elder Brothers


A fair hour sweet Lady.


Good morrow gentlemen, Master Inesse, and M. Possibility.


Where Is the little sweet Lady your daughter?


Even at her book sir.


So religious?


It Is no new motion sir, she has took it from an infant.


May we deserve a sight of her, Lady?


Upon that condition you will promise me gentlemen, to avoid all profane
talk, wanton complements, indecent phrazes, and lascivious courtings* (which I
know my daughter will sooner die then endure,) I am contented your suits
shall be granted


Not a bawdy syllable I protest.


Syllable was plac'st there, for indeed your one sillables are your bawdiest
words, prick that down


She may make nightwork ont, it was well recovered, He Cats and Curtizans strowle
most in the night, Her friend may be receiude and conuayde forth, nightly, He be
at charge for watch and ward, for watch and ward in faith, and here they come


Give your worship good even.


Welcome my friends, I must deserve your diligence in an employment serious:
the troth is, there is a cunning plot laid, but happily discovered, to rob my
house: the night uncertain when, but fixed within the circle of this month: nor
does this villainy consist in numbers

Or many partners, only some one
Shall in the form of my familiar friend,
Be receiude privately into my house,
By some perfidious servant of mine own,
Addressed fit for the practice.

O abominable!


If you be faithful watchmen, show your goodness, And with these Angels shore
up your eyelids: Let me not be purloind, purloind indeed; the merry Greeks
conceive me: there is a Iem I would not loose, Kept by the Italian under lock
and key: we English men are careless creatures: well, I have said enough


And we will do enough sir.


Why well said, watch me a good turn now, so, so, so,
Rise villainy with the Lark, why it is prevented,
Or steal't by with the leather winged Bat:
The evening cannot save it, peace; Oh Lady Gulman, my wifes only company!
welcome; and how does the virtuous Matron, that good old Gentlewoman thy
mother? I persuade my self, if modesty be in the world she has part on it: a
woman of an excellent carriage all her life time, in Court, City, and Country


Sha's always carried it well in those places sir; witness three bastards a
piece: how does your sweet bedfellow sir? you see I Am her boldest visitant


And welcome sweet Virgin, the only companion, my soul wishes for her; I
left her within at her Lute, prithee give her good counsel


Alas, she needs none sir.


Yet, yet, yet, a little of thy instructions will not come amiss to her.


I Will bestow my labor sir.


Do, labor her prithee; I have conuay'd away all her wanton Pamphlets, as
Hero and Leander, Venus and Adonis, oh two lushious mary-bone pies for a young
married wife, here, here, prethie take the resolution, and read to her a
little


Sha's set up her resolution already sir.


True, true, and this will confirm it the more, there is a chapter of Hell, it is
good to read this cold weather, terrify her, terrify her; go, read to her
the horrible punishments for itching wantonness, the pains allotted for
adultery; tell her her thoughts, her very dreams are answerable, say so; rip
up the life of a Curtiza, and show how loath some it is


The gentleman would persuade me in time to disgrace my self, and speak ill
of mine own function


This is the course I take, I Will teach the married man
A new selected strain, I admit none
But this pure virgin to her company,
Puh, that is enough; I Will keep her to her stint,
I Will put her to her pension,
She gets but her allowance, that's bare-one,
Few women but have that beside their own,
Ha, ha, ha, nay I Will put her hard toote.

Feign would I meet the gentleman.


Push, feign would you meet him, why, you do not take the course.


How earnestly she labors her, like a good wholesome sister of the family, she
will prevail I hope


Is that the means?


What is the means? I would as gladly to enjoy his sight, embrace it as the --


Shall I have hearing? listen?


She Is round with her in faith.


When husbands in their ranck'st suspicions dwell,
Then it is our best Art to dissemble well,
Put but these notes in use, that I Will direct you,
Hele curse himself that ere he did suspect you,
Perhaps she will solicit you, as in trial
To visit such and such, still giued denial,
Let no persuasions sway you, they are but fetches
Set to betray you, Ielousies, slights and reaches,
Seem in his sight to endure the sight of no man,
Put by all kisses, till you kiss in common,
Neglect all entertain, if he bring in
Strangers, keep you your chamber, be not seen;
If he chance steal upon you, let him find,
Some book lie open against an unchaste mind,
And coted Scriptures, tho for your own pleasure,
You read some stirring pamphlet, and convey it
Under your Skirt, the fitest place to lay it,
This is the course my wench to enjoy thy wishes,
Here you perform best, when you most neglect,
The way to daunt, is to outuie suspect,
Manage these principles but with Art and life,
Welcome all Nations, you are an honest wife.

She puts it home in faith, even to the quick
From her Elaborate action I reach that,
I must requite this maid, faith Im'e forgetful.

Here Lady, convey my heart unto him in this Jewel,
Against you see me next you shall perceive
I have profited, in the mean season tell him
I am a prisoner yet, a'th masters side,
My husbands jealousy, that masters him, as he does master me,
And as a keeper that locks prisoners up,
Is himself imprisoned under his own key,
Even so my husband in restraining me,
with the same ward bars his own liberty.

I Will tell him how you wish it, and I Will wear
My wits to the third pile, but all shall clear.

I owe you more then thanks, but that I hope
My husband will requite you.

Think you so Lady? he has small reason for it.


What done so soon? away, to it again, to it again, good wench to it again,
leave her not so, where left you. come


Faith I am weary sir.
I cannot draw her from her strickt opinion.
With all the arguments that sense can frame.

No; let me come, Fie wife, you must consent; what opinion is it, let us hear?


Fondly and wilfully she retains that thought, That every sin is dambd.


Oh fie, fie, wife! Pea, pea, pea, pea, how have you lost your time? for shame
be converted: there is a diabalocall opinion indeed; then you may think that
usury were dambd: you're a fine merchant in faith; or briberie? you know the law
well; or sloth? would some of the Clergy heard you in faith; or pride? you come
at Court; or gluttony? you're not worthy to dine at an Aldermans table

Your only deadly sin's Adultery,
That villainous ring-worme, woman's worst requital,
It Is only lechery that's dambd to the pit-hole;
Ah, that is an arch-offence, believe it squall,
All sins are venial but veneriall.

I Have said enough to her.


And she will be ruled by you.


Fah.


I Will pawn my credit ont; come hither Lady,
I will not altogether rest ungrateful,
Here, wear this Rubie for thy pains and counsel.

It is not so much worth sir, I am a very ill counselor truly.


Goo too I say.


You Are too blame in faith sir, I shall nere deserve it.


Thou have don't already: farewell sweet Virgin, prithee let us see thee oftener.


Such gifts will soon entreat me.


Wife, as thou love the quiet of my breast,
Embrace her counsel, yield to her aduices;
Thou will find comfort in them in the end;
Thou Wilt feel an alteration, prithee think on it:
Mine eyes can scarce refrain.

Keep in your dew sir, least when you would, you want it.


I Have pawnde my credit on it, ah did thou know, The sweet fruit once,
thoud'st never let it go


It Is that I strive to get.


And still do so.


You have bin too much like your name Sir Bounteous.


Oh not so, good Knights, not so, you know my humor; most welcome good Sir
Andro Pelcut, Sir Aquitaino Colewort, most welcome


Thanks good Sir Bounteous.


Oh, cry your worship heartily mercy Sir.


How now linen stockins, and threescore mile a day; whose footman art thou?


Pray can your worship tell me, Hoh, hoh, hoh, if my L. be come in yet.


Thy L! what L?


My L. Owe-much sir.


My L. Owe-much! I have heard much speech of that L. h'as great acquaintance
in the City; that L. has bin much followed


And is still sir; he wants no company when he is in London: he is free of the
Mercers, and there is none of them all dare cross him


And they did, he would turn over a new leaf with them; he would make them all
weary on it in the end: much fine rumor have I heard of that L. yet had I never
the fortune to set eye upon him; art sure he will alight here Footman? I am
afraid you are mistook


Thinks your worship so sir? by your leave sir.


Puh; passion of me, Footman, why Pumps I say come back.


Does your worship call?


Come hither I say, I am but afraid on it, would it might happen so well, how
do know? did he name the house with the great turret a'th top


No says did he not sir.


Come hither I say, did he speak of a cloth a gold chamber?


Not one word by my troth sir.


Come again you lowzie seven mile an hour?


I beseech your worship detain me not.


Was there no talk of a fair pair of Orgaines, a great guilt candlestick,
and a pair of silver snuffers


It Were sin to belie my Lord, I heard no such words sir.


A pox confine thee, come again, puh,


Your worship will undo me sir.


Was there no speech of a long dining room, a huge kitchen, large meat, and a
broad dresser board


I have a greater maw to that indeed, an't please your worship.


Whom did he name?


Why one Sir Bounteous Progress.


Ah, a, a, I am that Sir Bounteous you progressiue round-about Rascal.


Laughs, puh --


I knew I should have him in the end, there is not a Lord will mis me I thank
their good honors, it is a fortune laid upon me, they can sent out their best
entertainment, I have a kind of complementall gift given me above ordinary
country Knights, and how soon, it is smelt out I warrant ye, there is not one
Knight in the Sheere able to entertain a Lord in the kue, or a Lady in the nick like
me, like me, there is a kind of grace belongs to it, a kind of Art which
naturally slips from me, I know not on it I promise you, it is gone before Im'e
aware on it, cuds me I forget my self, where --


Does your worship call?


Run sirrah, call in my chief gentleman in the chain of gold, expedite; and how
does my good Lord? I never saw him before in my life, a cup of bastard for this
footman


My Lord has trauaild this five year sir.


Trauaild this five year? how many children has he? some bastard I say.


No bastard an't please your worship.


A cup of Sack to strengthen his wit, the footmans a fool; oh, come hither
master Gunwater, come hither, send presently to master Phesant for one of his
hens, there is Partrige in the house


And Wild-duck an't please your worship.


And Woodcock an't please thy worship.


And Woodcock an't please your worship, I had thought to have spoke before you.


Remember the Phesant, down with some Plouer, clap down six Woodcocks, my
love's coming; now sir


Ant please your worship there is a Lord and his followers newly alighted.


Dispath I say, dispatch, why where is my music? he is come indeed.


Footman.


My Lord.


Run swiftly with my co^mendations to S. Jasper Topas We Will ride and visit him
in the morning say


Your Lordships charge shall be effected.


That Courtly comely form, should present to me Sir Bounteous Progress.


You Have found me out my Lord, I cannot hide my self, Your honor in most
spatiously welcome


In this forgive me Sir, that being a stranger to your houses,
And you, I make my way so bold, and presume
Rather upon your kindness then your knowledge,
Only your bounteous disposition.
Fame has diuulgd, and is to me well known.

Nay, and your Lordship know my disposition, you know me better then they that
know my person; your honor is so much the welcomer for that


Thanks good sir Bounteous.


Pray pardon me, it has been often my ambition my L. both in respect of your
honorable presence, and the prodigal fame that keeps even stroke with your
unbounded worthiness

To have wished your Lordship, where your Lordship is
A noble guest in this unworthy seat:
Your Lordship nere heard my Organs.

Heard of them sir Bounteous, but never heared them.


The're but double guilt my L. some hundred and fifty pound wilt fit your
Lordshippe with such another pair


Indeed sir Bounteous?


O my L. I have a present suit to you.


To me sir Bounteous, and you could nere speak at fitter time? for I Am here
present to grant you


Your Lordship has been a traveler.


Some five year sir.


I have a Grandchild my L. I love him; and when I die I Will do somewhat for him:
I Will tell your honor the worst of him, a wild lad he has been


So we have been all sir.


So we have been all indeed my L. I thank your Lorships assistance; some
comic prancks he has bin guilty of; but I Will pawn my credit for him, an honest
trusty bosom


And that's worth all sir.


And that's worth all indeed my L. for he is like to have all when I die;
imberbis Iuuenis, his chin has no more prickles yet then a midwiues: there is
great hope of his wit his haire's so long a coming; shall I be bold with your
honor, to prefer this aforesaid Ganimed to hold a plate under your Lordships
cup


You wrong both his worth, and your bounty, and you call that boldness; Sir I
have heard much good of that young Gentleman


Nay h'as a good wit in faith my L.


H'as carried himself always generously.


Are you aduisde of that my L.? h'as carried many things cleanely: I Will show your
Lordship my Will, I keep it above in an Out landish box; the whoreson boy must
have all: I love him, yet he shall nere find it as long as I live


Well sir, for your sake, and his own deserving, I Will reserve a place for him
nearest to my secrets


I understand your good Lordship, you will make him your Secretary: my music,
give my L. a taste of his welcome


So, how like you our Airs my Lord? are they choice?


The're seldom matched believe it.


The Consort of mine own household.


Ye sir.


The Musicians are in Ordinary, yet no ordinary Musicians: your Lordship shall
hear my Organs now


Oh I beseech you sir Bounteous.


My Organist.

Come my L. how does your honor relish my Organ?


A very proud Air in faith sir.


Oh, how cannot choose, a Walloon plays upon them, and a Welchman blows wind in
their breech


You must pardon us my L. hasty cates, your honor has had even a hunting meal
on it; and now I am like to bring your Lordship to as mean a lodging, a hard
Down bed in faith my L. poor Cambricke sheets, and a cloth a Tissue Canopy,
the Curtains indeed were wrought in Venice, with the story of the Prodigal
child in silk and gold, only the Swine are left out my L. for spoiling the
curtains


TO was well prevented sir.


Silkin rest, harmonious slumbers, and venetiall dreams to your Lordship.


The like to kind Sir Bounteous.


Fie, not to me my L. I Am old, past dreaming of such vanities.


Old men should dream best.


Their dreams indeed my L. you have gi'nt us: tomorrow your Lordship shall see my
Cocks, my Fish Ponds, my Park, my Champion grounds; I keep Champers in my
house can show your Lordship some pleasure


Sir Bounteous you even whelme me with delights.


Once again a musical night to your honor; I Will trouble your Lordship no more.


Good rest sir Bounteous; so, come, the vizards, where be the masking suits?


In your Lordships Portmantua.


Peace Leiftenant.


I had rather have war, Captain.


Puh, the plot's ripe; come, to our business lad, Tho guilt condemns, it is gilt
must make us glad


Nay, and you be at your distinctions Captain, I Will follow behind no longer.


Get you before then, and whelme your nose with your vizard, go.

Now Grandsire, you that hold me at hard meat,
And keep me out at the Dags end, I Will fit you;
Under his Lordships leave, all must be mine
He and his Will confesses, what I take then
Is but a borrowing of so much before hand;
I Will pay him again when he dies, in so many blacks,
I Will have the Church hung round with a noble a yard,
Or requite him in Scutchions, let him trap me
In gold, and I Will lap him in lead; quid pro quo: I
Must look none of his Angels in the face forsooth,
Until his face be not worth looking on; Tut lads,
Let Sires and Grandsires keep us low, we must
Live when the're flesh, as well as when the're dust.

Go, sirrah, run presently to M. Penitent Brothel; you know his lodging, knock
him up, I know he cannot sleep for sighing; tell him I Have happily bethought a
mean

To make his purpose prosper in each limb,
Which only rests to be approved by him:
Make have, I know he thirsts for it.
Within. Oh.


Hark, the're at their business.


Thieves, thieves.


Gag that gaping rascal, tho he be my Grandsires chief Gentleman in the chain
of gold, I Will have no pity of him; how now lads


All Is sure and safe, on with your vizard sir; the servants are all bound.


There Is one care past then, come follow me lads, I Will lead you now to the point,
and top of all your fortunes; yo'n lodging is my Grandsires


So, so, lead on, on.


Here Is a Captain worth the following, and a wit worth a man's love and admiring!


Oh gentlemen, and you be kind gentlemen, what countrymen are you?


Linconsheere men Sir.


I am glad of that in faith.


And why should you be glad of that?


Oh, the honestest thieves of all come out of Linconsheere; the kindest naturde
Gentlemen; the'le rob a man with conscience: they have a feeling of what they
go about, and will steal with tears in their eyes: ah pitiful gentlemen


Push, Money, money, we come for money.


Is that all you come for? Ah what a beast was I to put out my money the other
day: alas good gentlemen, what shift shall I make for you? pray come again
another time


Tut, tut sir, money.


Oh not so loud sir, you're too shrill a Gentleman; I have a L. lies in my
house, I would not for the world his honor should be disquieted


Who my L. Owemuch? we have took order with him before hand, he lies bound in
his bed and al his followers


Who my L? bound my L? Alas what did you mean to bind my L? he could keep his
bed well enough without binding: you have undone me i'nt already, you need rob me
no farther


Which is the Key, come?


Ah I perceive now, you are no true Linconsheere spirits; you come rather out of
Bedforesheere, we cannot lie quiet in our beds for you: so, take enough my
Masters; spur a free horse, my name's sir Bounteous, a merry world in faith; what
Knight but I keep open house at midnight? well, there should be a conscience,
if one could hit vppon't


Away now, ceaze upon him, bind him.


Is this your Court of equity? why should I be bound for mine own money? but
come, come, bind me, I have need on it; I have been too liberal to night,
keep in my hands: nay, as hard as you list; I am too good to bear my L.
company, you have watched your time my Masters; I was Knighted at Westminster,
but many of these nights will make me a Knight of Windsor; you have deserude so
well my Masters; I bid you all to dinner to morrow, I would I might have your
companies in faith, I desire no more


Oh ho sir!


Pray meddle not with my Organs, to put them out of tune.


Oh no, heeres better music sir.


Ah pox feast you.


Dispatch with him, away; so, thank you good Grandsire; this was bounteously
done of him in faith; it came somewhat hard from him at first; for indeed nothing
comes stiff from an old man but money: and he may well stand upon that, when
he has nothing else to stand upon: where is our Port-mantua


Here Bully-Captaine.


In with the purchase, it will lie safe enough there vnder's nose I warrant you:
what, is all sure


All Is sure Captain.


You know what follows now, one villane binds his fellows; go, we must be all
bound for our own securities raskals, there is no dallying' vppo'th point; you
conceit me: there is a L. to be found bound in the morning, and al his
followers, can you pick out that L. now


O admirable spirit!


You nere plot for your safeties, so your wants be satisfied.


But if we bind one another, how shall the last man be bound?


Pox on it, I Will have the footman escape.


That's I, I thank you sir.


The Footman of all other will be supposde to escape, for he comes in no bed all
night; but lies in's clothes, to be first ready in the morning: the horse and he
lies in litter together; that is the right fashion of your bonny Footman: and
his freedom will make the better for our purpose; for we must have one in the
morning to unbind the Knight, that we may have our sport within our selves: we
now arrive at the most ticklish point, to rob, and take our ease, to be thieves
and lie by it, looker to it lads, it concerns every man's gullet; I Will not have
the jest spoilde, that is certain, tho it hazard a windepipe: I Will either go
like a L. as I came, or be hanged like a these as I am; and that is my
resolution


Troth a match Captain, of all hands.


Oh M. Penitent Brothel!


What is it sweet Lady Gulman, that so seazes on thee with rapture and
admiration


A thought, a trick, to make you sir especially happy, and yet I my self a
sauer by it


I would embrace that Lady with such courage, I would not leave you on the
loosing hand


I will give trust to you sir, the cause then why I raisde you from your bed so
soon; wherein I know sighs would not let you sleep, thus understand it: You
love that woman (M. Harebraines wife) Which no invented means can crown with
freedom, For your desires and her own wish, but this, Which in my slumbers
did present it self


I Am covetous Lady.


you know her husband lingering in suspect, Locks her from all society, but
mine


Most true.


I only am admitted, yet hitherto That has done you no real happiness; by my
admittance I cannot perform that deed, that should please you, You know:
wherefore thus I Have conuaid'd it, I Will counterfeit a fit of violent sickness


Good.


Nay it is not so good by my faith, but to do you good.


And in that sense I called it, but take me with you Lady; would it be probable
enough to have a sickness so suddenly violent


Puh, all the world knows women are soon down; we can be sick when we have a
mind to it, catch an ague with the wind of our fans, surfeit upon the rumpe of a
Lark, and bestow ten pound in physic upon it; we are likest our selves when
we are down: it is the easiest Art and cunning for our sect to counterfeit sick,
that are always full of sits when we are well; for since we were made for a
weak imperfect creature, we can sit that best that we are made for: I thus
translated, and your self slipped into the form of a Physician


I a Physician Lady, talk not on it I beseech you, I shall shame the whole
College


Tutman, any guacksaluing terms will serve for this purpose; for I am
pitifully hanted with a brace of elder brothers, new perfumde in the first of
their fortunes, and I shall see how forward their purses will be to the
pleasing of my pallat, and restoring of my health; lay on load enough upon them,
and spare them not, for the're good plump fleshly Asses, and may well enough
bear it: let gold, Ambre, and dissolved Pearl, be common ingrediences, and
that you cannot compose a cullisse without them: put but this cunningly in
practice, it shall be both a sufficient recompense for all my pains in your
love, and the ready means to make Mistress Harebraine; way, by the visiting of
me to your mutual desired company


I Applaud thee, kiss thee, and will constantly embrace it.


Ho, Gunwater!


Singlestone!


Ienkin, wa, ha, ho.


Ewen!


Simcod!


Footman! whewe --


Oh good your worship, let me help your good old worship.


Ah poor honest footman, how did thou escape this massacre?


Even by miracle, and lying in my clothes sir.


I think so, I would I had lain in my clothes to Footman, so I had escaped them;
I could have but risse like a beggar then, and so I do now, till more money
come in; but nothing afflicts me so much, my poor Geometrical Footman, as
that the barberous villains should lay violence upon my L. Ah, the binding of
my L. cuts my heart in two pieces; so, so, it is well, I thank thee, run to
thy fellows, undo them, undo them, undo them


Alas, if my L. should miscarry, the're unbound already sir; they have no
occupation but sleep, feed, and fart.


If I be not ashamde to look my L in the face, I Am a Sarassen my L.


Who Is that?


One may see he has been scard, a pox on them for their labors.


Singlestone!


Singlestone? I Will nere answer to that in faith.


Suchman-


Suchman? nor that neither in faith; I am not brought so low, tho I be old.


Who Is that in the chamber?


Good morrow my L. it is I.


Sir Bounteous good morrow, I would give you my hand sir, but I cannot come at
it; is this the courtesy a'th country sir Bounteous


Your Lordship grieves me more then al my loss; It Is the vnnatural'st sight
that can be found, To see a noble gentleman hard-bound


Trust me, I thought you had been better beloved sir Bounteous; but I see you
have enemies sir, and your friends fare the worse for em: I like your talk
better then your lodging; I nere lay harder in a bed of Down; I have had a
mad nights rest on it: can you not gesle what they should be Sir Bounteous


Faith Lincolneshire men my Lord.


How? fie, fie, believe it not sir, these lie not far off I warrant you.


Think you so my Lord?


I Will be burnt and they do, some that use to your house sir, and are familiar
with all the couneiances


This is the commodity of keeping open house my Lord, that makes so many shut
their doors about dinner time


They were resolute villains, I made my self known to them, told them what I
was; gave them my honorable word not to disclose them


O saucy unmannerly villains!


And think you the slaves would trust me upon my word?


They would not?


Forsooth no, I must pardon them, they told me Lords promises were mortal, and
commonly die within half an hour after they are spoken; they were but
gristles, and not one amongst a hundred come to any full groth, or perfection,
and therefore tho I were a L. I must enter into bond


Insupportable Rascals.


Troth Im'e of that mind Sir Bounteous you fared the worse for my coming hither.


Ah good my Lord, but Im'e sure your Lordship fared the worse.


Pray pity not me sir.


Is not your honor sore about the brawne of the arm? a murren meet them, I
feel it


About this place Sir Bounteous?


You feel as it were a twinge my Lord?


I, even a twinge, you say right.


A pox discover them, that twinge I feel too.


But that which disturbs me most Sir Bounteous lies here.


True, about the wrist, a kind of Tumid numnes.


You say true Sir.


The Reason of that my Lord is, the pulses had no play.


Mass so I gest it.


A mischief swell them, for I feel that to.


Sli'd here is a house haunted indeed.


A word with you sir.


How now Singlestone?


Im'e sorry my Lord your Lordship has lost.


Pup, pup, pup, pup, pup.


What have I lost? speak?


A good nights sleep say.


Speak, what have I lost I say?


A good nights sleep my Lord, nothing else. Curtens drawn


That Is true, my clothes come.


My Lords clothes, his honor's rising.


Hist, well said, come hither, what has my Lord lost, tell me, speak softly?


His Lordship must know that Sir.


Hush, prithee tell me.


It Will do you no pleasure to know it Sir.


Yet again? I desire it I say.


Since your worship will needs know it, they have stolen away a jewel in a blew
silk riband of a hundred pound price, beside some hundred pounds in fair
Spur-Royals


That Is some two hundred in the total.


Your worship's much about it Sir.


Come follow me, I Will make that whole again in so much money, let not my Lord
know on it


Oh pardon me Sir Bounteous, that were a dishonor to my Lord, should it come to
his ear, I should hazard my undoing by' it


How should it come to his ear? if you be my Lords chief man about him, I
hope you do not use to speak, unless you be paid for it, and I had rather give
you a Counselors double Fee to hold your peace, come, go too, follow me I say


There will be scarce time to tell it sir, my Lord will away instantly.


His honor shall stay dinner by his leaue', I Will prevail with him so far; and
now I remember a lest; I bad the whoreson thieves to dinner last night, I would
I might have their companies, a pox poison them


Faith and you are like to have no other guess Sir Bounteous, if you have none
but us, I Will give you that gift in faith


YOu see bold guests Master Hareb.


You Are kindly welcome to my house; good Master Inesse, and Master Possibility.


That Is our presumption Sir.


Rafe?


Here Sir.


Call down your mistress to welcome these two Gentlemen my friends.


I shall Sir.


I will observe her carriage, and watch The slipperie reuolotions of her eye,
I Will lie in wait for every glance she gives, And poyze her words in the balance
of suspect, If she but swag she is gone, either on this hand Over familiar, or
this, too neglectfull, It does behoue her carry her self even


But master Hareb.


True, I hear you sir; wa'st you said?


I have not spoke it yet Sir.


Right, so I say.


Is it not strange, that in so short a time, my little Lady Gulman should be so
violently handled


Oh, sickness has no mercy sir,
It neither pitties Ladies lip, nor eye,
It crops the Rose out of the Virgins cheek,
And so deslowres her that was nere deslorw'd,
Fools then are maids to lock from men that treasure,
Which death will pluck, and never yield them pleasure;
Ah gentlemen, tho I shadow it, that sweet Virgins sickness griues me not
lightly, she was my wives only delight and company
Did you not hear her gentlemen, in the midst
Of her extremest sit, still how she called upon my wife,
Remembered still my wife, sweet mistress Harebraine,
When she sent for me, a one side of her bed stood the Physician,
the Scriuener on the other, two horrible objects, but,
mere opposites in the course of their lives, for the Scriuener
binds folks, and the Physician makes them loose.

But not loose of their bonds Sir?


No by my faith sir, I say not so, if the Physician could make them loose of
their bonds, there is many a one would take Physic, that dares not now for
poisoning, but as I was telling of you, her Will was fashioning, Wherein I
found her best and richest Jewel, Given as a Legacy unto my wife, When I read
that, I could not refrain weeping, well of all other, my wife has most reason
to visit her, if she have any good nature in her, she will show it there, now
sir where is your mistress


She desires you, and the gentlemen your friends, to hold her excused, sha's a
fit of an Ague now upon her, which begins to shake he


Where does it shake her most?


All over her body Sir.


Shake all her body? it is a saucie fit, Im'e jealous of that Ague, pray walk
in gentlemen, I Will see you instantly


Now they are absent sir, it is no such thing.


What?


My mistress has her health Sir,
But it is her suit, she may confine her self
From sight of all men, but your own dear self Sir,
For since the sickness of that modest Vergin
Her only company, she delights in none;

No; visit her again, commend me to her, Tell her they are gone, and only I my
self Walk here to exchange a word or two with her


I Will tell her so sir.


Fool that I am, and madman, beast! what worse?
Suspicious over a creature that deserves
The best opinion, and the purest thought,
Watchful over her that is her watch her self,
To doubt her ways, that looks too narrowly
Into her own defects; I, foolish-fearefull
Have often rudely, out of giddie flames
Bard her those objects which she shuns her self,
Thrice I Have had proof of her most constant temper,
Come I at unawares by stealth upon her,
I find her cercled in with Divine Writs
Of heavenly meditations; here and there
Chapters with leaves tuckt up, which when I see
They either tax pride or adultery,
Ah let me curse my self, that could be jealous
Of her whose mind no sin can make rebellious.
And here the unmatched comes, now wife in faith they are gone,
Push, see how fearful it is, will you not credit me?
They Are gone in faith, why, hinke you I Will betray you? come, come, thy delight and
mine, thy only virtuous friend, thy sweet instructresse is violently taken,
grievous sick, and which is worse, she mends not


Her friends are sorry for that Sir.


She calls still upon thee, poor soul, remembers thee still, thy name whirles
in her breath, where is mistress Harebraine says she


Alas good soul,


She made me weep thrice, she has put thee in a jewel in her Will.


Eee'n tot'h last gasp a kind soul.


Take my man, go, visit her.


Pray pardon me sir, alas my visitation cannot help her.


Oh yet the kindness of a thing wife; still she holds the same rare temper; take
my man I say


I would not take your man sir, tho I did purpose going.


No? thy reason?


The worlds condition is it self so vild Sir,
It Is apt to judge the worst, of those deserve not,
It Is an ill-thinking age, and does apply
All to the form of it own Luxury,
This censure flies from one, that, from another,
That man's her Squire, says he; her Pimpe, the the other,
She Is of the stamp, a third, fourth, I ha known her:
Iu'e heard this, not without a burning cheek:
Then our attires are taxt, our very gate
Is called in question, where a husbands presence
Scatters such thoughts, or makes them sink for fear
Into the hearts that breed them, nay surely if I went Sir,
I would entreat your company.

Mine? prithee wife, I have been there alreadle.


That Is all one; although you bring me but to the door Sir, I would entreat no
farther


Thu'rt such a wife; why I will bring thee thither then, but not go up I
swear


In Faith you shall not, I do not desire it sir.


Why then content.


Give me your hand you will do so Sir.


Why there is my lip I will.


Why then I go Sir.


With me or no man, incomparable such a woman.


Lady?


Ha, what news?


There Is one Sir Bounteous Progress newly alighted from his footecloth, and his
Mare waits at door, as the fashion is


Sli'd, it is the knight that privately maintains me, a little short-olde.
spinye Gentleman, in a great dublet


The same, I know them.


He Is my sole Reuenew, meat, drink, and raiment; my good Physician work
upon him, Im'e weak


Enough.


Why, where be these Ladies? these plump soft delicate creatures? ha?


Who would you visit sir?


Visit, who? what are you with the plague in your mouth?


A Physician sir.


Then you are a loose-liuer Sir, I have put you to your purgation.


But you need none, you are purged in a worse fashion,


Ah, Sir Bounteous.


How now? what art thou?


Sweet Sir Bounteous.


Pashion of me, what an alteration's here? Rosamond sick old Harry? here is a
sight able to make an old man shrink, I was lusty when I came in, but I am
down now in faith, mortality, yea? this puts me in mind of a hole seven foot
deep, my grave, my grave, my grave, hist, master Doctor a word sir, hark, it is
not the Plague? is it


The Plague Sir, no?


Good.


He never asks whether it be the Pox or no, and of the twain that had been
more likely


How now my wench? how do?


Huh, weak Knigh, huh.


She says true, he is a weak Knight indeed.


Where does it hold thee most, wench?


All parts alike Sir.


She says true still, for it holds her in none.


Hark in thine ear, you are breeding of young bones, I am afraid I have got
thee with child in faith


I fear that much sir.


Oh, oh, if it should, a young Progress when all is done.


You have done your good will Sir.


I see by her, it is nothing but a surfeit of Venus in faith, and tho I be old, I
have gin't her, but since I had the power to make thee sick, I Will have the
purse to make thee whole, that is certain; master Doctor


Sir.


Lets hear I pray, what is it you minister to her?


Marry Sir, some precious cordial, some costly refocillation, a composure
comfortable and restoratiue


I, I, that, that, that.


No poorer ingrediences then the liquor of Currall, clear Amber, or Succinum,
Unicorns horn six grains, Magisterium, Perlarum one scruple


Ah.


Ossis de Cord Cerui half a scruple, Aurum Potabile or his tincture.


Very precious Sir.


All which being finely contunded, and mixed in a stone or glass mortar, with
the spirit of Diamber


Nay pray be patient Sir.


That Is impossible, I cannot be Patient and a Physician too Sir.


Oh, cry you mercy, that is true Sir.


All which aforesaid.


I, there you left Sir.


When it is almost exsiccate or dry, I add thereto olei Succini, olei Masi,
and Sinamoni


So Sir, olei Masi, that same oil of Mase is a great comfort to both the
Counters


And has been of a long time Sir.


Well, be of good cheer wench, there is gold for thee; huh, let her want for
nothing M. Doctor, a poor kinsewoman of mine, nature binds me to have a care
of her; there I guld you M. Doctor: gather up a good spirit wench, the fit will
away, it is but a surfeit of gristles: ha, ha, I have sitted her; an old Knight
and a cock a'th game still, I have not spurs for nothing I see


No by my faith, the're hatched, they cost you an Angel sir.


Look to her good M. Doctor, let her want nothing, I Have given her enough
already, Ha, ha, ha


So, is he gone?


He Is like himself gone.


Here Is somewhat to set up with; how soon he took occasion to slip into his
own flattery, soothing his own defects; he only fears he has done that deed,
which I nere feared to come from him in my life, this purchase came unlooked for


H'ist, the pair of sons and heirs.


Oh, the're welcome, they bring money.


M. Doctor.


I come to you Gentleman.


How does she now?


Faith much after one fashion sir.


There Is hope of life sir.


I see no signs of death of her.


That Is some comfort; will she take any thing yet?


Yes, yes, yes, she will take still: she has a kind of facility in taking: how
comes your band bloody sir


You may see I met with a scab sir.


Diuersa genera Scabierum, as Pliny reports, there arediners kind of Scabs.


Pray lets hear them sir.


An itching scab, that is your harlot; a sore scab, your usurer; a running,
your promooter; a broad scab, your intelligencer; but a white scabbe, that is a
scald knave and a Pander: but to speak truth, the only scabs we are now a
days troubled withal, are new officers


Why now you come to mine sir, for I Will be sworn one of them was very busy
about my head this morning, and he should be a scab by that, for they are
ambitious and covet the head


Why you saw I deriu'de him sir?


You Physicians are mad Gentlemen.


We Physicians see the most sights of any men living, you're Astronomers look
upward into'th air, we look downward into'th body, and indeed we have power
upward and downward


That you have in faith sir.


Lady, how cheer you now?


The same woman still, huh.


That Is not good.


Little alteration, Fie, fie, you have been to lavish Gentlemen.


Puh, talk not of that Lady, thy health's worth a million; here M. Doctor,
spare for no cost


Look what you find there sir.


What do you mean gentlemen, put up, put up, you see I Am down and cannot
strive with you, I would rule you else; you have me at advantage, but if ever I
live, I will requite it deeply


Tut an't come to that once, we will requit our selves well enough.


Mist. Harebrain, Lady, is setting forth to visit you too.


Hah, huh.


There struck the munit that brings forth the birth of all my joys and
wishes; but see the jar now, how shall I rid these from her


Pray gentleman, stay not above an hour from my sight.


S'foot we are not going Lady.


Subtly brought about, yett' will not do, the'le stick by it; a word with
you gentlemen


What says M. Doctor?


She wants but settling of her sense with rest, one hours sleep gentlemen
would set all parts in tune


He says true in faith.


Get her to sleep M. Doctor, we will both sit here and watch by her.


Hels Angels watch you, no Art can prevail with them; what with the thought of
joys, and sight of crosses, my wits are at Hercules pillars, non plus vltra


M. Doctor, M. Doctor?


Here Lady.


Your physic works, lend me your hand.


Farewell sweet Lady.


Adue M. Doctor.


So.


Let me admire thee,
The wit of man, wanes and decreases soon,
But women's wit is ever at full moon.
There shot a star from heaven,
I dare not yet behold my happiness.
The splendour is so glotious and so piercing.

Mistress Harebraine, give my wit thanks hereafter, your wishes are in sight,
your opportunity spacious


Will you but hear a word from me?


Whooh --


My husband himself brought me to the door, walks below for my return;
jealousy is prick-eard, and will hear the waging of a hair


Pish, y' are a faint-liuer, trust your self with your pleasure, and me with
your security, go


The fulness of my wish.


Of my desire.


Beyond this sphere I never will aspire.


I Will listen, now the flesh draws nie her end,
At such a time women exchange their secrets,
And ransack the close corners of their hearts;
What many years has whelmed, this hour imparts.

Pray sit down, there is a low stool, good Mistress Harebraine, this was kindly
done; huh give me your hand; huh, alas how cold you are: even so is your
husband, that worthy wise Gentleman; as comfortable a man to woman in my case,
as ever trod -- huh -- shoe leather, love him, honor him, stick by him, he
lets you want nothing, that is fit for a woman; and to be sure on it, he will see
himself that you want it not


And so I do in faith, it is right my humor.


You live a Ladies life with him, go where you will, ride when you will, and do
what you will


Not so, not so neither, she is better looked to.


I know you do, you need not tell me that; it were even pity of your life
in faith, if ever you should wrong such an innocent gentleman; fie Mistress
Harebraine, what do you mean? come you to discomfort me? nothing but weeping
with you


She Is weeping, t'as made her weep, my wife shows her good nature already.


Still, still weeping? huff, huff, huff, why how now woman? hey, hy, hy, for
shame leave; suh, suh, she cannot answer me for snobbing


All this does her good, beshrew my heart and I pity her, let her shed tears
till morning; I Will stay for her, she shall have enough on it by my good will; I Will
not be her hinderance


O no, lay your hand here Mistress Harebraine: I there, Oh there, there lies my
pain good gentlewoman: sore? Oh I, I can scarce endure your hand vppon't


Poor soul, how she is tormented.


Yes, yes, I eat a Cullisse an hour since.


There Is some comfort in that yet, she may escape it.


Oh it lies about my heart much.


I Am sorry for that in faith, she will hardly escape it.


Bound, no, no, I Would a very comfortable stool this morning.


I Am glad of that in faith, that is a good sign, I smell, she will escape it now.


Will you be going then?


Fall back, she is coming.


Thanks good Mistress Harebraine, welcome sweet Mistress Harebraine, pray commend
me to the good gentleman your husband


I could do that my self now.


And to my uncle Winchcombe, and to my Aunt Lipsalue, and to my cosen Falsetop,
and to my cosen Lickit, and to my cosen Horseman, and to all my good cosens in
Clearken well, and Saint Ioneses


At three days end my husband takes a journey.


Oh thence I derive a second meeting.


May it prosper still, Till then I rest a captive to his will: Once again
health, rest, and strength to thee sweet Lady: farewell, you witty squall;
good M. Doctor have a care to her body if yous stand her friend, I know you can
do her good


Take pity of your waiter, go: farewell sweet Mistress Harebraine.


Welcome sweet wife, alight upon my lip, never was hour spent better.


Why, were you within the hearing sir?


I that I was in faith, to my great comfort; I deceiud you there wife, ha, ha;
I do entreat thee, nay conjure thee wife
Upon my love, or what can more be said?
Oftener to visit this sick virtuous maid.

Be not so fierce, your will shall be obaide.


Why then I see thou love me.


Art of Ladies.
When plots are even past hope, and hang their head,
Set with a woman's hand, they thrive and spread.

Wast not well manag'de, you necessary mischiefs? did the plot want either life
or Art


Tw's so well Captain, I would you could make such another Musse at all
adventures


Do cal't a Musse? I am sure my Grandsire nere got his money worse in his
life, then I got it from him, if ever he did cozen the simple; why I was borne
to revenge their quarrel; if ever oppress the widow? I, a fatherles child
have done as much for him; and so it is through the world either in jest or
earnest, let the vserer look for it, for craft recoyles in the end, like an
ouercharg'd musket, and maymes the very hand that puts fire to it; there needs
no more but a Usurers own blow to strike him from hence to hell, it will set him
forward with a vengeance; but here lay the jest whoresons, my Grandsire
thinking in his conscience that we had not robbed him enough over night, must
needs pity me in the morning, and give me the rest


Two hundred pounds in fair Rose-Nobles I protest.


Push, I knew he could not sleep quietly til he had paid me for robing of him
too, it is his humor, and the humor of most of your rich men in the course of
their lives; for you know, they always feast those mouths that are least
nedie, and give them more, that have too much already; and what call you that,
but robing of themselves a Courtlyer way; Oh


Cuds me, how now Captain?


A cold fit that comes over my memory, and has a shrode pull at my fortunes.


What Is that Sir?


Is it for certain, Lieftenant, that my Grandsire keeps an uncertain
creature, a Queen


I that is too true Sir.


So much the more 'preposterous for me, I shall
hop shorter by that trick; she carries away the thirds at least;
twill prove en-tayld land I am afraid when all is done, in faith
nay, I have known a vicious-old-thought-acting Father,
Damb'd only in his dreams, thirsting for game,
(When his best parts hung down their heads for shame,)
For his blancht harlot dispossess his son,
And make the pox his heir, twa's gravely done:
How had thou first knowledge on it Lieftenant?

Faith from discourse, yet all the policy That I could use, I could not get
her name


Dull slave that never could spy it.


But the manner of her coming was described to me.


How is the manner prithee?


Marry sir she comes, most commonly coacht.


Most commonly coacht indeed, for coaches are as common now adays, as some
that ride in them, she comes most commonly coacht


True, there I left sir, guarded with some leash of Pimps.


Beside the coachman?


Right sir, then alighting, she is privately received by master Gunwater.


That Is my Grandsires chief Gentleman in the chain of gold, that he should
live to be a Pander, and yet look upon his chain and his velvet jack


Then is your Grandsire rounded in the ear, the key given after the Italian
fashion, backward, she closly conuaid into his closet, there remaining, till
either opportunity smile upon his credit, or he send down some hot caudle to
take order in his performance


Peace, it is mine own in faith, I haa'te.


How now Sir?


Thanks, thanks to any spirit, That mingled it among my inventions.


Why master Folly-wit?


Captain?


Give me scope and hear me,
I have begot that means which will both furnish me,
And make that queen walk under his conceit.

That were double happiness, to put thy self into money and her out of favor.


And all at one dealing?


S'foot I long to see that hand played,


And thou shall see it quickly in faith; nay it is in grain, I warrant it hold
color: Leiftenant, step behind yo'n hanging; if I mistook not at my entrance,
there hangs the lower part of a gentlewomans gown, with a mask and a
chinclout; bring all this way: Nay, but do it cunningly now, it is a friends
house, and I Would vfe it so, there is a taste for you


But prithee what will thou do with a Gentlewomans lower part?


Why use it.


You Have answered me indeed in that, I can demand no farther.


Well said Leiftenant.


What will you do now sir?


Come, come, thou shall see a woman quickly made up here.


But that is against kind Captain, for they are always long a making ready.


And is not most they do against kind I prithee? to lie with their
Horse-keeper, is not that against kind? to wear half moons made of another
hair, is not that against kind? to drink down a man, she that should set him
up, pray is not that monstrously against kind now? nay over with it Leiftenant,
over with it, ever while you live put a woman's clothes over her head: Cupid
plays best at blind-man buff


You shall have your will maintenance, I love mad tricks as well as you for
your heart sir; but what shift will you make for upper bodies Captain


I see now you are an Ass, why I Am ready.


Ready?


Why the Doublet serves as well as the best, and is most in fashion, weere all
Male tot'h middle, mankind from the Beuer to the Bum, it is an Amazonian time,
you shall have women shortly tread their husbands; I should have a couple of
Locks behind, prithee Lieutenant find em out for me, and wind 'em about my
hatband, nay you shall see, we will be in fashion to a hair, and become all with
probability, the most musty-visage Critic shall not except against me


Nay i will give thee thy due behind thy back, thou art as mad a piece of Clay --


Clay! do call thy Captain Clay? indeed clay was made to stop holes, he
says true; did not I tell you rascals you should see a woman quickly made up


I Will swear for it Captain.


Come, come, my mask and my chin-cloute -- Come into'th Court.


Nay they were both 'ith Court long ago sir.


Let me see, where shall I choose two or three for Pimps now? but I cannot choose
amiss amongst you all, that's the best; well, as I am a Queen, you were best
have a care of me, and guard me sure, I give you warning before hand, it is a
monckie taylde-Age. Life, you shall go nigh to have half a douzen blythe
fellows surprise me cowardly, carry me away with a pair of owers, and put in
at Putney


We should laugh at that in faith.


Or shoot in vppo'th coast of Cue.


Two notable fit landing places for Leachers, P. and C. Putney and Cue.


Well, say you have fair warning on it, the hair about the hat is as good as a
flag vppo'th pole at a common Playhouse to wast company, and a chin-cloute is
of that powerful a traction I can tell you, twill draw more Linen toot


Fear not us Captain, there is none here but can fight for a whore as well as
some Innes a Court-man


Why then set forward; and as you scorn two shilling brothell, twelve penny
Pandarisme, and such base bribes, guard me from bonny Scribs, and bony Scribes


Hang 'em, pensions, and alowancces, four pence half penny a meal, hang 'em.


Ha? read that place again, -- Adultery
Draws the Divorce twixt heaven and the soul!
Accursed man that standst diuors't from heaven,
Thou wretched unthrift, that have played away
Thy Eternal portion at a minutes game,
To please the flesh, have blotted out thy name:
Where were thy nobler meditations busied?
That they durst trust this body with it self,
This natural drunkard that undoes us all,
And makes our shame apparent in our fall.
Then let my blood pay fort, and vex and boil,
My soul I know would never grieve tot'h death,
The Eternal spirit that feeds her with his breath:
Nay I that knew the price of life and sin,
What Crown is kept for continence, what for lust?
The end of man, and glory of that end
As endless as the giver:
To dote on weakness, slime, corruption, woman?
What is she, took asunder from her clothes?
Being ready, she consists of hundred pieces,
Much like your German cloak, and nere allied
Both are so nice, they cannot go for pride.
Beside a greater fault, but too well known,
They Will strike to ten, when they should stop at one;
Within these three days the next meeting's fixed,
If I meet then, hell and my soul be mixed.
My lodging I know constantly, she not knows,
Sins hate is the best gift that sin bestows:
I Will nere embrace her more, -- never -- better witness, never.

What at a stand? the fitter for my company?


Celestial soldiers guard me,-


How now man? Lase did the quickness of my presence fright thee?


Shield me you ministers of faith and grace.


Leave, leave, are you not ashamd to use such words to a woman?


Thou Art a Devil.


A devil? feel, feel man, has a devil flesh and bone?


I do conjure thee by that dreadful power --


The man has a delight to make me tremble;
Are these the fruits of thy aduenturous Love?
Was I entisst for this? to be soon rejected?
Come, what has changd thee so, Delight;

Away.


Remember.


Leave my sight.


Have I this meeting wrought with cunning.
Which when I com^e I find thee shunning?
Rowze thy amorous thoughts and twine me,
All my interest I resign thee:
Shall we let slip this mutual hour,
Comes so seldom in her power?
Where Is thy lip, thy clip, thy fadome?
Had weomen such loves. would't not mad 'em?
Art a man? or do abuse one?
A Love! and know not how to vse-one?
Come, i will teach thee --

Do not follow.


Once so firm and now so hollow?
When was place and season sweeter?
Thy bliss in sight and dare not meet her?
Where Is thy courage youth and vigor?
Loves best pleased, whent's seard with rigor:
Ceare me then with veins most cheerful,
Weomen love no flesh that is fearful;
It Is but a sit, come Drinck't away,
And dance and sing, and kiss and play -- Fa le
La, le la, Fa le la, le la la; Fa le la, fa la le
La le la.

Torment me not.


Fa le la, fa le la, fa la la, loh.


Fury.


Fa le la, fa le la, fa la la loh.


Devil! I do conjure thee once again,
By that soule-quaking thunder to depart,
And leave this chamber, freed from thy dambd Art.

Stamps --


It has preuayld -- Oh my sin-shaking Sinews! what should I think? Iesper,
why Iesper


Sir! how now? what has disturbed you sir.


A sit, a qualme, -- is mistrisse Hargraue gone?


Who sir? mistrisse Hargraue?


Is she gone I say?


Gone? why she was never here yet.


No!


Why no sir.


Art sure ont.


Sure ont? if I be sure I breathe, and am my self?


I like it not; -- where kepst thou?


In The next room sir.


Why she struck by thee man.


Youde make one mad sir, that a gentlewoman should steal by me and I not hear
her, sfoote, one may hear the rusling of their bums almost an hour before we
see 'em


I will be satisfide, -- although to hazard,
What though her husband meet me? I am honest;
When men's intenes are wicked, their guilt haunts em,
But when they are just, they are armd, and nothing daunts 'em.

What strange humor call you this? he dreams of weomen and both his eyes
broad open


Why how now master Gumwater? what is the news with your have?


I have a thing to tell your worship --


Why prithee tell me, speak man.


Your worship shall pardon me, I have better bringing up then so.


How sir?


It Is a thing made fit for your Ear sir --


Oh -- o -- o -- cry you mercy, now I begin to taste you, -- is she come?


She Is come sir?


Recouerd, well and sound again?


That Is to be feared sir.


Why sir?


She wears a Linen cloth about her Iawe,


Ha, ha, haw, -- why that is the fashion you whoreson Gumwater.


The fashion sir? live I so long time to see that a fashion, which rather was
an Emblem of disprayse, It was suspected much in Mounsiers days


I, I, in those days, that was a queasie time, our age is better hardened now,
and put oftener in the fire, we are tried what we are: tut, the Pox is as
natural now, as an Ague in the Spring time, we seldom take physic without
it; here, take this key, you knew what duties belong to it, go, -- give order
for a Cullize, let there be a good fire made in the matted chamber, do you hear
sir? --


I know my office sir.


An old man's venery is very chargeable my masters, there much cooquery belongs
to it


Come Lady, you know where you are now?


Yes, good master Gumwater.


This is the old closet you know.


I remember it well sir.


There stands a Casket, I would my yearly revenue were but worth the wealth
that's locked int Lady; yet I have fifty pound a year wench


Beside your apparel sir?


Yes faith have I.


But then you reckon your chain sir.


No by my troth do I not, neither: faith and you consider me rightly sweet
Lady, you might admit a choice gentleman into your service


Oh, pray away sir.


Pusha come, come, you do but hinder your fortunes in faith, I have the command
of all the house, I can tell you, nothing comes intot'h kitchen, but comes
through my hands


Pray do not handle me sir.


Faith you are too nice Lady: and as for my secrecy you know I have vowed it often
to you


Vowed it? no, no, you men are fickle, --


Fickle? -- sfoote bind me Lady --


Why I bind you by virtue of this chain to meet me to morrow at the
Flowredeluce yonder, between Nine and Ten


And if I do not Lady let me lose it, thy love and my best fortunes?


Why now i will try you, go too.


Farewell sweet Lady.


Welcome sweet cockscombe; by my faith a good induction, I perceive by his
ouerworne phrase, and his action toward the middle region still there has bin
some saucy nibling motion, and no doubt the cunning queen waited but for her
prey, and I think it is better bestowd upon me for his souls health; -- and his
bodies too; i will teach the slave to be so bold yet, as once to offer to vault
into his masters saddle in faith: Now Casket, by your leave, I have seen your
outside often, but that's no proof. Some have fair outsides that are nothing
worth: ha? -- now by my faith a gentlewoman of very good parts, Diamond, Rubie,
Sapphire, Onix cum prolo Silexque; if I do not wonder how the queen scapte
tempting, I Am an Hermophrodite, sure she could lack nothing, but the Devil to
point to it, and I wonder that he should be missing; well, it is better as it is,
this is the fruit of old-grunting-venerie. Grandsire, you may thank your Drab
for this; oh fie, in your crinckling days Grandsire, keep a Curtizan to
hinder your Grandchild, it is against Nature in faith, and I hope you will be weary
ont: Now to my villains that lurk close below: Who keeps a Harlot tell him
this from me, He needs nor these, disease, nor enemy


Ah sirrah, me think I feel my self well tosted, bumbasted, rubd and
refresht; but in faith I cannot forget to think how soon sickness has altered
her -- to my taste, I gave her a kiss at bottom o'th stayres, and byth mass
me thought her breath had much ado to be sweet, like a thing compounded me
thought of wine, Beer, and Tobacco, I smelt much Pudding in it. It may be but
my fancy, or her physic: For this I know, her health gave such content, The
fault rests in her sickness, or my sent. How do thou now sweet girl, what
well recouerd? Sickness quite gone, ha? speak -- ha? wench? Frank Gulman,
why body of me, what is here? my Casket wide open, broke open, my Jewels stolen
-- why Gumwater --


Anon anon sir.


Come hither Gumwater.


That were small manners sir in faith, i will find a time anon your worship's busy
yet


Why Gumwater?


Fo nay then you will make me blush in faith sir. --


Where Is this Creature?


What creature is it you'de have sir?


The worst that ever breathes.


That's a wild Bore sir.


That Is a vilde whore sir; -- where did thou leave her Rascal?


Who? your Recreation sir.


My Execration sir.


Where I was wont, in your worships closet.


A pox engrosse her, it appears too true, See you this Casket sir.


My chain, my chain, my chain, my one and only chain.


Thou runst to much purpose now, Gumwater, ye? Is not a Queen enough to
answer for, but she must join a thief to it, a theeuing Queen, Nay I have
done with her in faith, it is a sign she has been sick a late, for she is a great
deal worse then she was, by my troth I would have paund my life upon it, did
she want anything? was she not supply de

Nay and liberally, for that's an olds man's sin,
We Will feast our Lechery, though we starve our kin.
Is not my name Sir Bounteous, am I not expressed there?
Ah fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, but I perceive
Tho she have never so complete a friend,
a strumpets love will have a wast in the end,
and distaste the vessel: I can hardly bear this;
But say I should complain, perhaps she has pawnd 'em,
Sfoote the Judges will but laugh at it, and bid her borrowe
more money of em, make the old fellow pay for's lechery,
that's all the mends I get, I have seen the same Cafe tried at
Newbery the last Sizes.
Well, things must slip and sleep, I will dissemble it,
because my credit shall not loose her luster,
But whilst I live, i will neither love nor trust her.
I ha done, I ha done, I ha done with her in faith.

Who'se that knocks?


A friend.


What Is your will sir?


Is master Hargraue at home?


No, newly gone from it sir.


Where Is the gentlewoman his wife?


My mistrisse is within sir.


When came she in I pray?


Who my mistrisse? she was not out these two days to my knowledge.


No? trust me I Would thought I Would seen her, I would request a word with her.


I Will tell her sir.


I thank you -- It likes me worse and worse. --


Why how now sir? it was desperately aduenturd, I little looked for you until the
morrow


No? why what made you at my chamber then even now?


I at your chamber?


Puh -- dissemble not, come, come, you were there.


By my life you wrong me sir.


What?


Firsty' are not ignorant what watch keeps over me, And for your chamber, as I
live I knowt not


Burst into sorrow then, and greeses extremes, Whilst I beat on this flesh.


What is it disturbs you sir? --


Then was the devil in your likeness there.


Ha?


The very Devil assumde thee formally,
That face, that voice, that gesture, that attire,
Even as it sits on thee, not a pleate alterd,
That Beuer band, the color of that Periwig,
The Farthingale abone the Nauill, all;
As if the fashion were his own invention,

Mercy defend me.


To beguile me more.
The cunning Succubus told me that meeting
Was wrought a purpose by much wit and Art,
Wept to me, laid my vows before me, vrgd me,
Gave me the private marks of all our Love,
Wood me in wanton and effeminate rimes,
And sung and danst about me like a Fayry,
And had not worthier cogitations blessed me,
Thy form and his enchantments had possessed me.

What shall become of me my own thoughts doom me.


Be honest; then the Devil will nere assume thee,
He has no pleasure in that shape to abide,
Where these two sisters reign not, lust of pride;
He as much trembles at a constant mind
As looser flesh at him, -- be not dismayde:
Spring souls for joy, his policies are betrayde;
Forgive me mistrisse Hargraue, on whose soul
The guilt hangs double,
My lust and thy enticement: both I challenge,
And therefore of due vengeance it appeard
To none but me to whom both sins inher'd;
What knows the lecher when he clips his whore
Whether it be the Devil his parts adore:
They Are both so like, that in our Natural sense,
I could discern no change nor difference.
No marvel then times should so stretch and turn
None for Religion, all for pleasure burn.
Hot zeal into hot lust is now transformde,
Grace into paynting, charity into clothes,
Faith into false hair, and put off as often,
There Is nothing but our virtue knows a mean,
He that kept open house now keeps a Queen.
He will keep open still, that he commends,
And there he keeps a table for his friends:
And she consumes more then her Sire could hoord,
Being more common then his house or board:
Live honest, and live happy, keep thy vows,
She Is part a Virgin whom but one man knows:
Embrace thy husband, and beside him none,
Having but one heart, give it but to one.

I vow it on my knees, with tears true bred
No man shall ever wrong my husbands bed.

Rise, I Am thy friend for ever.


And I thine
For ever and ever, -- Let me embrace thee sir, whom I will
love, even next unto my soul, and that's my wife,
Two dear Rare Iems this hour presents me with,
A wife that's modest, and a friend that's right,
Idle suspect and fear, now take your flight.

A happy inward peace crown both your joys


Thanks above utterance to you, -- now? the news?


Sir Bounteous Progress sir,
Inuites you and my mistrisse to a feast,
On Tuesday next; his man attends without --

Return both with our willingness and thanks.
I will entreat you sir, to be my guest.

Who I sir.


Faith you shall.


Well, i will break strife.


A friend's so rare, i will sooner part from life.


What so coy, so strickt, come, come.


Pray change your opinion sir, I am not for that use.


Will you but hear me?


I shall hear that I would not.


Sfoote this is strange, I Have seldom seen a wench Stand upon stricter points,
life she will not endure to be courted, does she ere think to prosper? I Will
nere believe that Tree can bring forth fruit, that never bears a blossom,
Courtships a blossom, and often brings forth fruit in forty weeks; Twere a
mad part in me, now to turn over: if ever there were any hope on it, it is at
this instant, shall I be madder now then ever I have been? 'ime in the way
in faith

Man's never at hie height of madness full,
Until he love and prove a woman's gull;
I do protest in earnest I nere knew
At which end to begin to affect a woman,
Till this bewitching minute, I nere saw
Face worth my object, till mine eye met hers, I should laugh and I were caught
in faith, I Will see her again that's certain, what Ere comes ont, by your favor
Ladies


You Are welcome sir.


Know you the young gentlewoman that went in lateley?


I have best cause to know her, 'ime her mother sir.


Oh in good time, I like the gentlewoman well, a pretty contrived beauty,


I, nature has done her part sir.


But she has one uncomely quality.


What Is that sir?


Sfoote she is afraid of a man.


A less, impute that to her bashful spirit, she is fearful of her honor.


Of her honor? slid 'ime sure I cannot get her maiden head with breathing upon
her, nor can she loose her honor in her tongue


True, and I have often told her so, but what would you have of a foolish
virgin sir, a wilful virgin, I tell you sir, I need not have been in that
solitary estate that I am, had she had grace and boldness to have put her self
forward, always timorsome, always backward, ah that same peevish honor of
hers, has undone her and me both good gentleman: the suitors, the jewels, the
ioynters that has been offered her, we had been made women for ever, but what
was her fashion? she could not endure the sight of a man for sooth, but run and
hole her self presently, so choice of her honor, I am persuaded, when ere she
has husband, she will eene be a president for all married wives, how to direct
their actions, and their lives


Have you not so much power with her, to command her presence.


You shall see straight what I can do sir.


Would I might be hanged, if my love do not stretch to her deeper and deeper,
those bashful maiden humors take me prisoner when their comes a restraint ont
upon flesh, we are always most greedy vppont, and that makes your mercha^ts
wife oftentimes pay so dear for a monthfull: give me a woman as she was made
at first, simple of her self, without Sophistication, like this wench, I
cannot abide them when they have tricks, set speeches and Artfull
entertainments, you shall have some so impudently aspected, they will outcry
the forehead of a man, make him blush first, and talk him into silence, and
this is counted manly in a woman, it may hold so, sure womanly it is not, no,
If ere I love, or any thing move me

T will be a woman's simple modesty.


Pray let me go, why mother what do you mean? I beseech you mother? is this
your conquest now? great glory it is to overcome a pore and silly virgin


The wonder of our time sits in that browe,
I nere beheld a perfect man till now.

Thou childish thing, more bashful then thour't wise,
Why do thou turn aside, and drown thine eyes?
Look fearful fool, there is no temptation nere thee,
Art not ashamd that any flesh should fear thee,
Why I durst pawn my life the gentleman means no other but honest and pure
love to thee, how say you sir


By my faith not I Lady.


Hark you there? what think you now forsooth? what greeues your honor now?
Or what lascivious breath intends to rear
Against that maiden Organ your chaste care?
Are you resolved now better of men's hearts?
Their faiths and their affections, with you none,
Or at most, few whose tongues and minds are one.
Repent you now of your opinion past,
Men love as purely as you can be chaste: to her your self sir,
The ways broke before you, you have the easier passage,

Fear not, come; erect thy happy graces in thy look;
I am no curious wooer, but infaith
I love thee honorably.

How mean you that sir?


Sfoot as one loves a woman for a wife,


Has the gentleman answered you, tro?


I do confess it truly to you both,
My estate is yet but sickly, but I Have a Grandsire
Will make me Lord of thousands at his death.

I know your Grandsire well; she knows him better.


Why then you know no fiction; my state then will be a long days journey above
the wast wench


Nay daughter he says true.


And thou shall often measure it in thy coache,
And with the wheels tract make a gridle for it.

Ah twilll be a merry iourny.


What is it a match, if it be clap hands and lips;


It Is done, there is witness on it.


Why then mother I salute you.


Thanks sweet son; -- Son Folliwit, come hither, if I might counsel thee,
we will eene take her while the good moods upon her, send for a Priest, and clapped
up within this hour


By my troth agreed mother.


Nor does her wealth consist all in her flesh,
Tho beauty be enough wealth for a woman,
She brings a Dowry of three hundred pound with her.

Sfoote that will serve till my Grandsire dies I warrant you, heel drop away
at fall a'th leaf, if ever he reach to all Hollantide i will be hanged


O yes son, he is a lusty old gentleman.


Ah pox, he is given to weomen; he keeps a queen at this present.


Fie.


Do not tell my wife ont.


That were needless in faith.


He makes a great feast upon the leauenth of this month, tuesday next, and you
shall see Players there, -- I have one trick more to put upon him; my wife and
your self shall go thither before as my guests, and prove his entertainment,
I Will meet you there at night, the jest will be here, that feast which he makes
will, unknown to him serve fitly for our wedding dinner, we shall be royally
furnished, and get some charges by'te


An excellent course (in faith) and a thrifty, why son, me thinks you begin to
thrive before you are married


We shall thrive one day wench, and clep enough? Between our hopes there is but a
Grandsires puff


So girl, here was a bird well caught.


If ever, here: but what fo'rs Grandsire, twill scarce please him well.


Who couets fruit, nere cares from whence it fell,
Thou'st wedded youth and strength, and wealth will fall:
Last thourt made honest.

And that's worth 'em all.


Have a care blew-coates; bestir your self Master Gumwater, cast an eye intoth
kitchen, orelooke the knaves a little, every lack has his friend to day, this
cosen and that cosen puts in for a dish of meat, a man knows not till he
make a feast how many varlets he feeds, acquaintances swarm in every corner,
like flies at Bartholmewtide that come up with drouers, sfoot I think they
smell my kitchen seven mile about master Shortrod and his sweet bedfellow,
yare very copiously welcome


Sir, here is an especial dear friend of ours, we were bold to make his way to
your table


Thanks for that boldness ever, good Master Shortrod, is this your friend sir?


Both my wifes friend and mine sir.


Why then compendeously sir, -- yare welcome.


In Octauo I thank you sir.


Excellently retorted in faith, he is welcome for's wit; I have my sorts of
salutes, and know how to place em Courtly; walk in sweet gentlemen, walk in,
there is a good fire in the Hall, you shall have my sweet company instantly


I good sir Bounteous


You shall indeed gentlemen; how now, what news brings thee in stumbling now?


There are certain Players come to town sir, and desire to interlude before
your worship


Players? by the mass they are welcome, the'yle grace my entertainment well,
but for certain players there thou lie boy; they were never more uncertain
in their lives, now up and now down, they know not when to play, where to
play, nor what to play, not when to play for fearful fools, where to play for
Puritan fools, nor what to play for critical fools -- go call em in, --
how fitly the whorsons come vpo'th feast, troth I was even wishing for em, -- oh
welcome, welcome my friends


The month of May delights not in her flowers, More then we joy in that sweet
sight of yours


Well acted a my credit, I perceive he is your best Actor.


He has greatest share sir; and may live of himself sir.


What what? put on your hat sir, pray put on; go too, wealth must be respected,
let those that have least feathers stand bare; and whose men are you I pray? nay
keep on your hat still


We serve my Lord Owemuch sir.


My L. Owemuch, by my troth the welcomst men alive give me all your hands at
once, that honorable gentleman? he lay at my house in a robbery once, and
took all quietly, went away cheerfully. I made a very good feast for him; I
never saw a man of honor bear things brauelier away, serve my L. Owemuch?
welcome in faith: some Bastard for my Lords Players, -- where be you boys


They come along with the Wagon sir.


Good, good, and which is your Politician amongst you? now in faith he that

for the companies business, which is he, come* be not afraid of him


I am he sir.


Art thou he? give me thy hand, hark in thine ear, thou row lest too fast to
gather so much moss as thy fellow there, champ upon that, ah, and what play
shall we have my masters


A pleasant witty Comedy sir.


I, I, I, a Comedy in any case, that I and my guests may laugh a little, what is
the name out


It Is called the Slip.


The Slip? By my troth a pretty name, and a glib one: go all and slip intoot,
as fast as you can cover a table for the players. First take heed of a Lurcher,
he cu^s deep, he will eat up all from you. Some Shirry for my Lords players
there. Sir, why this will be a True feast, a right Miter supper, a play and
all, more lights -- I called for light, here come in two are light enough for a
whole house in faith. Dare the thief look me in the face? O impudent times! go

Bless you sir Bounteous.


O welcome, welcome, Thief, Queen, and Bawd, welcome all three.


Nay heeres but two on's sir.


A my troth, I took her for a couple, I Would have sworn there had been two
faces there


Not all under one hood sir.


Yes faith would I, to see mine eyes bear double.


He make it hold sir, my daughter is a couple, She was married yesterday. Sir
Boun. Buz


Nay to no buzzard neither, a right Hawk When ere you know him.


Away, he cannot be but a Rascal* walk in walk in, bold guests, that come
vnfent for -- post, I perceive how my Jewels went now, to grace her marriage


Would you with me sir?


Ey, how hapt it wench, you put the slip upon me,
Not three nights since? I name it gently to you,
I term it neither Pilfer, Cheat, nor Sharke.

Y'ear past my reach.


I Am old and past your reach, very good; but you will not deny this I trust.


With a safe conscience, sir.


Ye? give me thy hand, fare thee well, I have done with her.


Give me your hand, sir, you nere yet begun with me.


Whew, whew? O audacious age.
She denies me and all, when on her fingers,
I spide the Ruby sit, that does betray her,
And blushes for her fact, well there is a time sor't,
For all is too little now for entertainment.
Feast, mirth, I harmony, and the play to boot.
A Iouiall Season. How now, are you ready?

Even upon readiness sir.


Keep you your hat on.


I have a suit to your worship.


Oh cry you mercy, then you must stand bare.


We could do all to the life of action sir, both for the credit of your
worships house, and the grace of our Comedy


Cuds me, what else sir?


And for some defects (as the custom is) we would be bold to require your
worships assistance


Why with all my heart, what is it you want? speak.


One's a chain for a Justices hat sir.


Why here, here, here, here whoreson, will this serve your turn?


What else lack you?


We should use a ring with a stone int.


Nay whoope, I have given too many rings already, talk no more of rings I pray
you, here, here, here, make this Jewel serve for once


Oh this will serve sir.


What have you all now?


All now sir -- one y time is brought in the middle of the play, and I would
desire your worships watch time


My watch, with all my heart, only give time a charge that he be not fidling
with it


You shall nere see that sir.


Well now you are furnishe sir, make haste away.


Even as fast as i can sir, -- I Will set my fellows going first, they must have
time and leisure, or they are dull else. He stay and speak a prologue, yet
overtake them, I cannot have conscience in faith to go away and speak nere a word
to them, my Gra^dsire has given me three shares here, sure I Will do somewhat for
them


More lights, more stools, sit sit, the play begins.


Have you players here Sir Bounteous?


We have them for you sir, fine nimble Comedians, proper actors most of them.


Whose men I pray you sir?


Oh* there is their credit sir, they serve an honorable popular Gentleman,
eclipped my Lord Ow-much


My Lord Ow-much, he was in Ireland lately.


O you nere knew any of the name but were great travelers,


How is the Comedy called, Sir Bounteous?


Mary sir, the Slip.


The Slip?


I, and here the prologue begins to slip in vpon's.


It Is so indeed Sir Boun.


We sing of wand^ing knights, what them betyde,
Who nor in one place, nor one thing abide,
They Are here now, and anon no scouts can reach em
Being every man well horst like a bold Beacham,
The Play which we present, no fault shall mere
But one, you will say it is short, we will say it is sweet:
It Is given much to dumb shows, which some praise,
And like the Term, delights much in delays.
So to conclude, and give the name her due,
The play being called the Slip, I vanish too.

Excellently well acted and a nimble conceyt.


The Prologues pretty in faith.


And went off well.


I that's the grace of all, when they go away well, ah-


A my troth and I were not married, I could find in my heart to fall in love
with that Player now, and send for him to a supper; I know some in the town that
have done as much, and there took such a good conceypt of their parts into'th
two-penny room, that the Actors have bin found ith morning in a less compass
then their Stage, tho twere nere so full of gentlemen


But, passion of me, where be these knaves, will they not come away, me thinks
they stay very long


Oh you must bear a little sir, they have many shifts to run into.


Shifts call you em, they are horrible long things.


A pox of such fortune the plots betrayed:

All will come out, yonder they come taken upon suspicion, and brought back by
a Constable, I was accursed to hold society with such Cockscombs, what is to be
done? I shall be shamde for ever, my wife here and al, ah pox -- by light
happily thought upon, the chain* Invention stick to me this once, and fail
me ever hereafter: so, so, --


Life I say, where be these Players, oh are you come, troth its time, I was even
sending for you


How moodily he walks, what plays he tro?


A, Justice upon my credit, I know by the chayn there.


Unfortunate Justice.


Ah -- a -- a --


In thy kin unfortunate.
Here comes thy Nephew now upon suspicion,
Brought by a Constable before thee, his vilde associates with him,
But so disguizde, none knows him but my self,
Twice have I set him free from officers sangs,
And for his sake, his fellows: let him look to it:
My conscience will permit but one wink more.

Ye shall we take Justice winking.


For this time I have be thought a means to work thy
freedom, tho hazarding my self; should the Law ceaze him,
Being kin to me, twould blenush much my name, No;
I Would rather lean to danger, then to shame.

A very expleate Justice.


Thank you good neighbors, let me alone with em now.


Sfoote whose yonder?


Dare he sit there?

2. Follywit.

3. Captain -- puh --


How now Constable what news with thee?


May it please your worship sir, -- here are a company of auspicious fellows.


To me; puh -- turn to the Justice you whoreson hobby horse, this is some new
player now, they put all their fools to the Constables part still


What Is the matter Constable, what is the matter?


I have nothing to say to your worship -- they were all riding a horseback ant
please your worshi


Yet again: a pox of all Asles still, they could not ride a foot unless twere
in a bawdy house


The Oftler told me they were all unstable fellows sir.


Why sure the fellow's drunk.


We spide that weakness in him long ago sir, your worship must bear with
him, the man's much oreseene, only in respect of his office we obeyed him, both
to appear conformable to law, and clear of all offense: for I protest sir, he
found us but a horse back


What he did?


As I have a soul, that's all, and all he can lay to us.


In Faith, you were not all riding away then.


S'foot, being a horseback sir, that must needs follow.


Why true sir.


Well said Justice, he helps his kinseman well.


Why Sir, do you use to bring Gentlemen before us for riding away, what will
you have em stand still when they are up, like Smug vpo'th white horse yonder?
are your wits steept? He make you an example for all dizzy Constables, how they
abuse justice, here bind him tot his chair


Ha, bind him hoe?


If you want cords, use garters.


Help, help, Gentlemen.


As fast as we can sir.


Thieves, thieves.


A gag will help all this, keep less noise^ you knave.


Oh help, rescue the Constable -- oh, O.


Ho, ho, ho, ho.


Why la you who lets you now?
You may ride quietly, I Will see you to,
Take horse my self. I have nothing else to do.

Oh, -- oh -- oh --


Ha, ha ha, by my troth the maddest piece of Justice gentlemen, that ever was
committed


He be sworn for the madness on it sir.


I am deceiu'de, if this prove not a merry Comedy and a witty.


A less poor Constable, his mouth's open, and nere a wife word.


Faith he speaks now even as many as he has done, he seems wisest when he
gapes and says nothing, ha ha; -- he turns and tells his tale to me like an
ass, what have I to do with their riding away, they may ride for me, thou
whoreson Cockscombe th^n; nay thou art well enough seru'de in faith


But what follows all this while sir, me thinks some should pass by before
this time, and pity the Constable


Byth mass and you say true sir, -- go sirrah, step in, I think they have
forgot themselves, call the knaves away they are in a wood I believe. --


I, I, I.


Hanke, the Constable says I, they are in a wood, -- ha, ha, --


He thinks long of the time sir Bounteous.


How now? when come they?


A less an't please your worship, there is not one of them to be found sir.


How?


What says the fellow?


Neither horse nor man sir.


Body of me thou lie.


Not a hair of either sir.


How now sir Bounteous.


Cheated and defeated, vngag that rascal, I Will hang him for's fellows, I Will
make him bring em out


Did not I tell your worship this before, brought em before you for suspected
persons, Hayd em at towns end upon warning given, made signs that my very iaw
bone aches, your worship would not hear me, called me Asle, saving your worships
presence laughed at me


Ha?


I begin to taste it.


Give me leave, give me leave, why art not thou the Constable in the Comedy?


Ith comedy? why I am the constable in the common wealth sir.


I am guld in faith, I am guld, when wast thou chose?


On thursday last sir.


A pox go wit'ht, ther't goes.


I seldom heard Jest match it.


Nor I in faith.


Gentlemen shall I entreat a curtesy?


What is it sir?


Do not laugh at me seven year hence.


We should betray and laugh at our own folly then, for of my troth none here
but was deceiud int


Faith that's some comfort yet, ha, ha, it was feately carried, troth I commend
their wits, before our faces, make us asses while we sit still, and only laugh
at our selves


Faith they were some counterfeit rogues sir.


Why they confess so much them selves, they said theyd play the slip, they
should be men of their words, I hope the Justice will have more conscience
in faith, then to carry away a chain of a hundred mark of that fashion


What sir?


I by my troth sir, besides a jewel, and a jewels fellow, a good fair watch
that hung about my neck sir


Sfoote what did you mean sir?


Me thinks my Lord Owemuches players should not scorn me so in faith they will
come and bring all again I know, push they will in faith, but a jest certainly


Pray Grandsire give me your blessing?


Who? Son Folliwit?


This shows like kneeling after the play, I praying for my Lord Owemuch and
his good Countess, our honorable Lady and mistress


Rise richer by a blessing, thou art welcome.


Thanks good grandsire, I was bold to bring those gentlemen my friends.


Their all welcome, salute you that side, and i will welcome this side. Sir to
begin with you


Master Follywit.


I am glad it is our fortune so happily to meet sir.


Nay then you know me not sir.


Sweet Mistress Harebraine.


You cannot be too bold sir.


Our marriage known?


Not a word yet.


The better.


Faith son would you had come sooner with these gentlemen.


Why Grandsire?


We had a play here.


A play sir, no.


Yes faith, a pox a'th Author.


Bles us all, why were they such vild ones sir?


I am sure villainous ones sir.


Some rawe-simple fools.


Nay bith mass these were enough for the euish knaves.


What sir?


Which way came you gentlemen, you could not choose but meet em.


We met a company with hampers after em.


Oh those were they, those were they, a pox hamper em.


Bless us all again.


They have hamperd me finely sirrah.


How sir.


How sir, I lent the rascals properties to furnish out their play, a chain, a
jewel, and a watch, and they watched their time, and rid quite away with em


Are they such creatures.


Hark, hark gentlemen, by this light the watch rings alarm in his pocket,
there is my watch come again, or the very Cosen German toot, whose is it, whose is it?
by the mass it is he, have thou one son? prithee bestow it upon thy Grandsire,
I now look for mine again in faith, nay come with a good will or not at all. I Will
give thee a better thing a piece, a piece gentlemen


Great or small,


At once I have drawn chain, jewel, watch and all.


By my faith you have a fortunate hand sir.


Nay all to come at once.


A vengeance of this soolecy.


Have I escape the Constable to be brought in by the watch?


O destiny, have I married a Thief mother?


Comfort thy self, thou art before hand with him daughter.


Why son, why gentlemen, how long have you bin my Lord Ow-much his servants
in faith


Faith Grandsire, shall I be true to you?


I think it is time, thoust been a these already.


I knowing the day of your feast, and the natural inclination you have to
pleasure and pastime, presumde upon your patience for a jest as well to prolong
your days as --


Whoop, why then you took my chain along with you to prolong my days did you?


Not so neither sir and that you may be seriously assured of my herafter
stablenesse of life, I have took another course


What?


Took a wife.


A wife? sfoot, what is she for a fool would marry thee a madman? when was the
wedding kept in Bedlam


She Is both a gentlewoman and a virgin.


Stop there, stop there, would I might see her.


You have your wish, she is here.


Ah, ha, ha, ha, this makes amends for all.


How now?


Captain do you hear? is she your wife in earnest?


How then?


Nothing but pity you sir.


Speak son is it true?
Can you gull us, and let a queen gull you.

Ha.


What I have bin is past, be that forgiven,
And have a soul true both to thee and heaven.

Is It come about, tricks are repaid I see.


The best is sirrah you pledge none but me
And since I drink the top, take her and hark,
I spice the bottom with a thousand mark.

By my troth, she is as good a cup of Nectar, as amy
Bachelor needs to sip at.
Tut give me gold, it makes amends for vice,
Maids without coin, are candles without spice.

Come gentlemen toth feast, let not time waste,
We have pleased our ear, now let us please our taste
Who lives by cunning mark it, his fates cast,
When he has guld all, then is himself the last.
