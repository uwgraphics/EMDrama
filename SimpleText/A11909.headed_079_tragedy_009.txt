NOw that Aurore with glitteryng streams,
The glading stars from sky does chase,
Sir Phoebus pert, with spouting beams,
From dewy neast does mount apace:
And with his cheerful looks does yield,
Unto the world a gladsome day.
Go to, O wretch, with ample Field
Of heavy cares oppressed aye,
Thy grievous wonted playntes recount:
Do not alone with sighs and howles,
The Seaysh Aloyones surmounte,
But also pass the Pandyon fowls:
More yrksome is thy state then theirs*
O Mother dear whose death by fits,
I nyll lament but still shed tears,
My ground of grief in thee it sits.
If that in shade of darksome den,
Perceiving sense at al remain,
Hear out at large, O mother then,
My great complayntes, and grievous pain
O that immortal Clothos wrist,
Had torn in twain my vital thread:
Ere I unto my grief had wist
Thy wounds, and face of sanguine red.
O day which aye does me annoy:
Since that time did I more desire,
The fearful darkness to enjoy,
Than Phoebus fresh with fair attire.
I have abode the bitter hest
Of stepdame dire, in mothers place,
I have abode her cruel breast,
Her stomach stout, and fighting face.
She, She, for spyte unto my case,
A doleful, and a grave Eryn,
To Bridegromes chamber spousall space,
The Stygian flashing flames brought in.
And thee, (alas) most piteous Sire,
With traytrous traynes has she bereft
Of breathing soul with poisoned mire:
To whom ere while, the world all left
Vnvanquisht from the Ocean Seas
By martial feats did freely yield:
And did subdue with wondrous ease,
The Brittayne brutes that fled the field:
Whom living at their propre swaye:
No Romayne power did erst invade.
Now lo (full well lament I may)
Thy Spouse deceypte thy prowes has lade ^
And now thy court and child of yore,
With homage serve a Tyrants lore.
WHom so the glistering pomp of royal place,
With soden sight ynumd does quite disgrace,
Who so at courtly fleeting ebbing blase,
Astonished sore, himself does much amase:
Lo see of late the great and mighty stock,
By lurking Fortunes sudden forced knock,
Of Claudius quite subvert and clean extinct:
Tofore, who held the world in his precinct:
The Brittayne Ocean coast that long was free,
He ruld at will, and made it to agree,
Their Roman Galleys great for to embrace.
Lo, he that Tanais people first did chase,
And Seas unknown to any Romayne wight
With lusty sheering ships did ouerdight,
And safe amid the savage freakes did fight,
And ruffling surging seas has nothing dread,
By cruel spouses gilt does lie all dead.
Her son likewise more fiend then Tigre fierce,
Of natural mother makes a funeral her se,
Whose brother drenched deep with poisoned cup.
Pore Britannick, his senseles soul gave up
Octauia sister and unhappy make,
Does sore lament her case for Britans sake,
Ne can her ruthful piteous sorrow slake,
Though Neros wrath do sore constrayne her grace
She nil esteems the secret closet place:
But boiling still with equal peysd disdain.
With mutual hate gaynst him does burn again.
My true and trusty love that I do bear,
In vain I see does strive to comfort her,
Revenging greedy grief does straight repriue,
To Appease her smarte the counsel that I give,
Nor flame of worthy breast does once relent
But heaps of grief, her courage do augment.
Alas, what griesely deeds for to ensue
My fear foreseeth: God grant it be not true.
O Staggering state, O peerless ill:
With ease Electra I repeat,
And call to mind thy mourning will.
With watered eyes like smarti^g sweat
Thou might lament thy father slain,
Still hoping that thy brother might,
That deadly deed revenge again.
Whom thou O tender loving wight
Did safely shield from bloody foe,
And natural love did closely keep:
But Neroes dreaded visage lo,
Does fear me that I dare not weep,
Nor wayle my parents ruchful case,
By cruel lot this slaughter cought:
Ne suffers me this geniall face,
To dash with tears to dearly bought
With brothers blood: who only was
Mine only hope in all my grief,
And of so many mischieues, as
My comfort great, and sole relief.
Now lo reserud for greater care,
And to abide more lingering pain,
Of noble famous lineage bare,
A drouping shade I do remain.
My Ladies heavy voice me thought
Within my listening ears can sound,
And snaylish age in going soft,
Unto her thews in not ybounde.

O Nurse our dolours witness sure
By curroll cheeks distilling rain,
And heavy hearts complaynt endure.

Alas, what day shall rid of pain,
With care your welnye wasted heart?

That sends this guiltles ghost to grave

This talk (good madame) set apart.

In rule my state their destenies have,
And not thy prayers, (O matrone) just.

The down soft easy God shall give,
Your troubled mind a time I trust,
More sweet then ever you did live.
With feuell fair as one content,
And glosed face, but only please
Your man, and make, he will relent.

The Lion fierce I shall appeal,
And sooner tame the Tygre stout,
Then mankind Tyrants brutish breast,
He spytes the noble raced ^out,
Contemmes high powers, disdaynes the least:
Ne can well use that princely weed,
Which venomous parent wrapped him in
By huge unspeakable griesly deed.
Although that wight unthankful, grynne,
In Kingly throne that he does raygne,
Through cruel cursed mothers aid:
Although he pay with Death again
So great a gift, it shall be said
And after fates in long spent age,
That woman wight shall have always,
This eloge yet and saying sage,
That he by her does bear the sway,

Let not your ragious mind so walk,
But do compresse your moody talk.

THough much I bear that boiling breast do beat
And tollerably take diuor cements threate,
Deaths only deadly darte, I see an end,
Of al my broyle and pinching pain can send,
What pleasant light to me (O wretch) is left,
My natural Mother slain, and Sire be reft,
Of breathing life, by treason, and by gilt:
Of Brother eake depriude: with miseryes spilt:
And wayling overcome: kept down with care,
Enuyed of Make, which I dare not declare.
To maiden subject now, and now defied:
What pleasant light can me (O wretch) abide,
With fearful heart suspecting always ought:
Because I would no wicked deed were wroughte:
Not that I fear Deaths griesly gyrning face,
God grant I do not so revenge my case,
A better deed to dye: for to behold
The Tyrants visage gri^^^e, with brows vprolde
And with soft tender lips my foe to kiss,
And stand in awe of beckes and noddes of his,
Whose will to please my grief with cares yfirde
Since brothers death by wicked wyle conspirde,
Could never once vouchsafe for to sustain,
Less grief to die, then thus to live in pain.
His Empire Nero rules and joys in blood:
The cause and ground of death that Tirant wood.
How often (alas) does Fancy fondly feign.
When slumber sweet in pensive parts does reign,
And sleep in eyes, all tyrd with tears does rest,
I apprehend dear Brittans lively breast:
Ere while me thinks his feeble shiuering hands
He fenseth sure with deadly blasing brandes,
And fiercely on his brother Neros face,
With sturdy stinging strokes he flies apace.
Ere while thilke wretch recoyleth back* again,
And to my thewes for aid retyres amayne:
Him foming foe pursues with have to have:
And while my brother I desire to save,
And in my clasped arms to shield him free,
His goary bloudied falchion keen I see.
The boisterous raumping fiend to ^ugge, and hale
Through out my ^hiuering limbs, as ashes pale.
Forthwith a mighty trembling chattering quake
From weary lims all souple sleep does shake,
And makes me woeful wretch for to recount,
My wayling sobbing sorrows that surmount.
Hereto, put to that gorgeous stately (...) ouse,
All glistring bright, with spoils of Claudius house
His parent dear in bubling boat did douse,
That wicked son, this fisking dame to please.
Whom yet escaping dangers great of Seas.
He fiercer freake than waves that scantly rest,
With bloody blade her bowels did vnbrest.
What hope of health, can me, O wretch, abide,
That after them thilke way I should not ride?
My special foe, triumphant wise does weight,
With naked nates to press by lovers slight,
Our spousall, pure, and clean vnspotied bed:
Against whom, she burns, with deadly food blood red.
And, for a meede of filthy strumpets sport,
She causes Make from spouse for to diuort.
O ancient Sire, step forth from Limbo lake,
Thy daughters heavy troublous cares to slake:
Or your twygated hellysh porche unfold,
That down through gaping ground I may be rolde.
O piteous wretch, in vain, (alas) in vain
Thou calst upon thy fathers senseless sprite:
In whom, God wot, there does no care remain
Of mortal brood, that here does take delight.
Shall he, think you, assuage your sorry cheer,
Or shape you forth some slight, t^ appall your pain,
That could prefer, before his Brittan dear,
The Imperial throne, a strange begotten swain?
And with incestiall love benumbed quyte
His brother Germanicks daughter that could plyght,
And join to him in solemn marriage rites,
With woeful, and unlucky lovers lights?
Here sprang the roale of hurly burly great,
Here beastly veuomous slaughter began to sweat,
Here wily treasons trains appeared first,
Here rules desire, and brutish bloody thirst.
Syllanus first Prince Claudius son in law,
A bloody mangled offering fall we saw,
That in our graces Hymaenea^ bed,
Ymatcht with you, he might not couche his head.
O monstrous slaughter, worthy endless blame^:
In stead of gift unto that wanton dame,
A Carcass cold pore soul, and curelesse corse,
Sillane was given against his will perforce.
And falsely then attacht of traitors crime,
As one conspyring death in Claudius time,
With loathsome streakes spewde out upon the wall,
He all bedasht your fathers princely hall.
Eft stepped into servile Palace stroke,
To filthy vices lore, one easly broke.
Of Devilish wicked with this Princocks proud:
By stepdames wyle prince Claudius Son auoude.
Whom deadly damme did bloody match ylight:
And thee, against thy will, for fear did plight.
Through which success this Dame of courage fine,
Durst venture, mighty Jove to undermine.
Who can so many cursed kinds report
Of wicked hopes, and acts in any sort,
Or such a woman's glosed guyles can name,
That raumpes at rule, by all degrees of shame?
Then holy sacred zeal put out of grace,
Her stagring steps, directed forth apace,
And stern Erinnis in with deadly steps,
To Claudius Court, all desert left yleps.
And with her dririe drakes of Stygian fort,
Has quite distainde the sacred princely port.
And raging riuen in twain both natures lore,
And right to wrongs misshapen form has tore.
That haughty minded dame first gave her make,
A deadly poisoned cup, his thyrst to slake.
Straight ways again through vise unkindly touch,
Her Nero causde with him in hell to couch.
And thee, unhappy Britt, in all that broyle,
Till that of breath, and life he did dispoyle,
Thilk greedy bloody tyrant never stent:
Whose doleful death for aye we may lament.
Ere while, unto the world the star that shone,
And was the stay of princely court alone,
Now lo, light ashes easly puffed aforne,
And griesly goast to grave with torche yborne.
Whom blessed Babe, thy stepdame did lament:
Nor from her gushing tears, did scarce relent,
When as she gave each trim appointed part,
And goodly portraide limbs with natures art,
Of flaming stacke to be devoured quite,
And saw the scortching fervent fire in sight
Thy naked joints to rauin up a pace
And like the flittring God thy comely face.

Dispatch he me least with this hand he fall.

That power you, nature granted not at all.

But wondrous dolor, great and wrathful ire,
And miseries will it grant without desire.

Nay rather cause your angry moody make,
With souple cheer his fury for to slake.

What, that he will by guilt once slain before,
Alive again my brother me restore?

Nay, safe that you may live and issue bear:
Your fathers ancient court for to repair.

That court does wait another brood they say.
And poor Britts death tugges me another way.

Yet let the cities love unto your grace,
Your troubled mind confirm but for a space.

Their minds so pressed to pleasure me, I know
Great comfort brings: but do not slake my woe.

Of mighty power the people have been aye.

But princes force does bear the greater sway.

He will respect his lawful wedded wife,

His mynion brave can not so lead her life.

Of no man she esteemde.

But dear to make*

She can not truly yet of wifehood crake.

Ere long she shall a mother eke be made.
So far therein I dare most boldly wade.

His youthful heat at first in filthy love,
With lusty, crusty pangs does boil above:
Thylke courage quickly cold in lust apace
As vapor sone extinct in flame gives place.
But holy, loving, chaste unspotted spouse,
Her love endures aye with sacred vows.
That wanton first that there durst couch her head,
And tumbling stained quite your spousall bed,
And being but your maid has ruled long,
Her sovereign Lord, with beauties grace bestong,
That pranked Paramour pert shall croutch with pain,
When she your grace shall see preferred again.
For Poppie subject is, and meek of spright,
And now begins her goastly tombs to dight:
Whereby she closely granting does bewray,
Her secret hidden fear each other day.
That swift, unconstant, double winged lad
With cloute, before his blinded eyes, yclad,
That fickle brayned God, thunhappy boy,
Shall leave her in the midst of all her joy:
Although for beauty bright the bell she bear,
And goodly glistring garments new she wear,
And now do vaunt her self in gorgeous geere,
She shall not long enjoy this gladsome cheer.
Be not dismayde, Madame, for such like pain,
The queen of gods was forced to sustain,
When to each pleasant shape the heavenly guide,
And sire of Gods y^urnde, from skies did glyde.
The swannes white wings, to se how they could fadge
He did on him, and ruckoldes bullysh badge,
That God shone bright in Golden raynie shower
To Danaes breast through top of fortred tower.
The twinkling stars the twins of Laeda bright,
Whom Pollux, some, and Castor, call aryght,
In large and ample space of starry scope,
With cristal glimering faces shine wide open.
And Semeles son, whom Bacchus we do call,
In heavenly byrthright does himself ystall.
And Hercules that puissant Champion stout,
His sturdy brawnes, his Hebe wyndes about.
Nor once regardes how Goddess Juno fare:
Whose lowering stepdame now she is yframde,
That while on earth his prowes he did declare,
Against that marriage, aye, was sore inflamd.
Yet lo her wise, and closly couched grief,
Debonaire face, obeisaunce to her leefe,
Causde him at length his mind for to remove,
Through mortal feeres estraundge from Iunos love.
And now that mighty heavenly Goddess great,
No more adred of mortal strumpets feat,
Aloft alone in cloudy bower contents
The thundering Lord, which now to her relentes.
Nor now with earthly Ladies beauty bright
Yfyred, leaves his starry specked right.
Now madam since on earth your power is pight
And have on earth Queen Iunos princely place,
And sister are, and wife to Neroes grace,
Your wondrous restles dolours great appease.

Nay, sooner shall the roaring froathy seas,
And mounting flashing flawes ymatch the sky,
And smoking, stifling parching fire dry
With dankish pooles agree and watrye fenne:
And griesly Plutoes filthy feltred den,
With starbright heaven shall sooner coupled be,
And shyning light with glomy shades agree,
And with the clear dry day the dewy night,
Than unto servile lore of husband wight,
That brutish wise in blood takes his delight,
My heavy woeful mind can I address,
While brothers death my heart does still possess.
O that of heavenly powers the prince and sire,
That shogges and shakes the earth with thu^dring fire,
And with his wondrous, fearful, cursed crackes,
And strange misshapen monsters which he makes,
Our fearful musing minds does sore amase,
Would coin some cureles burning wildfyre blase,
To pelt and pash with thumping fire bright,
That devilish pate, that cruel cursed wight.
We saw from heaven, with beams forthshoting far
Doubtless a dreadful heary, blasing star:
That spouted out a mortal fiery flake,
Whose force a princes blood can only slake:
Even where that hayting carman sloe Boot
With chilling cold al starcke of frosen pole,
Does guide aright Charles whirling running rote,
In stead of night that never away does role.
Lo now the open air in every streate,
With doggish tyrants breath, is poisoned, quite,
And dreadful stars some sudden death do threate.
To people ruled, by wicked Neroes spright.
So stern a freake, or mankind tyrant stout,
Not Tellus with the Gods displeasd brought out,
When mighty Jove neglected she vphorlde
Huge, ugly, monstrous Typhon to the world.
A sorer plague, a cleaner scouryng scourge,
With bloody paws that cities bounds does purge,
Is Nero dyre, this cruel cursed wight.
That does himself gaynst God and man ydyght:
And thrustes from sacred shrynes their quiet port,
And goodly temples gay ^he sancted sort:
That cittyes dwellers puts from countries fort:
That has bereft his brother of his life,
And launcht his mothers sides with goary knyfe:
Yet does this present lightsome day enjoy
And leads his life, that does us sore annoy.
O Father of heaven, in vain why do thou throw
Thy great vnuanquisht rattling thundering blow
Upon the whistling woods and ample seas,
With force of princely power thy wrath to appease?
Ou such an hurtful and pernicious freake,
Thy due and just conceived ire to wreake.
Why stay thy mighty puissaunt braunds so long,
Ere thou fling down thy rattling cracking throng?
O Lord, that Nero once might pay the price,
Of all his deuilish deeds, and every vice,
The Whole wide worlds tyrant stern where he a stroke
Does bear: which he ouerlades with burdnous yoke
Of princely sire yborne, but does defame,
With beastly manners vile his princely name:

Vnworth he is your spousall chamber place:
But yet your destnies force, you must embrace,
And well, abide your fortunes crooked race:
Nor move unkindly Neroes gauly ire.
One day perchance, there will as I desire,
Some God revenge your lamentable case:
And once I trust a gladsome day shall be,
When you shall joy a fresh in wonted place.

Ah. no, now, long this court (alas) we see
With heavy wrath of Gods displeased ire
Has ouercharged been: which Venus dyre
With Messalinas monstrous ramping lust,
She first has brought adowne into the dust.
Who madly married to prince Claudius grace,
But little myndful then of that same case,
And not regarding much thappoynted pain,
With cursed cressets married once again.
To which unlucky incestuall brydall bed,
That drosell dyre that furious slut Erin,
With hanging hair about her hellish head,
And gyrt with snakes with deadly step went in.
And flaming brandes from spousall chamber cought,
In both their bloods ybathd, has quenched clean:
And has incenst prince Claudius burning thought
In bloody thratling stroke to pass all mean.
My mother first of wretches all the most,
With stripe of deadly sword gave up her ghost.
And now extinguished quite, left me forlorn,
With dolours pyning panges and mourning worn.
And after her in hellish teame does hayle,
Unto the senseles souls of Plutoes iaile
Her make, and Brittannick her son that way:
And first this ruinous court did she betray.

Let be, Madame, with tears your face to dight:
Ne so renew your bitter wayling just:
Cease troubling now your parents piteous spright,
That paid has the price of raging lust.

God grant the talk we heard of late,
To rashly trusted every where,
And blown abroad through each estate,
No badge of truth that it may bear.
And that no fresh espoused dame,
Our Princes thewes do enter in,
But that OCTAVIA keep the same,
And that the seed of GLADIV Skin,
May once bringforth some pledge of peace:
That to the world rest may redowne,
And wrangling strife may easly cease,
And Rome retain her great renown.
The peerlesse Princess Juno hight,
Her brothers wedlock yoke retaynes:
Why is AUGUSTUS sister bright,
Where like betroathed league remaynes,
From stately pomp of court reject,
What does deuoutnes her avail?
To sayncted sire who has respectt?
What does her Virgins life prevail?
And CLAVDIV Snow in ground ylayed,
Even we to much vnmyndefull be:
Whose worthy steme we have betrayed
Throught fear that made us to agree.
In breast our elders did embrace,
The perfect Romayne puissaunce,
The true unstained worthy race,
And blood of Mars they did advance.
The proud and lofty stomackt train
Of lusty hauty minded Kings,
They could not suffer to remain
Within this noble Cities wings.
And justly they reuengd thy death,
O Virgin chaste, VIRGINIA pure,
Depriude by sire of vital breath,
That bondage thou might not endure:
And that his shameless brutish lust,
So good a meede might not enjoy:
Although by filthy force unjust
Thy chastity he would annoy.
Thee likewise whom thine own right hand,
With sword did pearce, LVCRETIA true,
Who tyrants rape could not withstand,
Did bloody broils and wars ensue*
ANd with her proud disdaynfull Make
Lord TARQVIN ympe of cursed seed,
Correction due does TVLLIA take
For her unkindly shameless deed,
Who on her Fathers mangled corse,
To mischief bent, and wicked bane,
The Carman she to drive did force,
His cruel brusing wombling wane.
And quite against all natures law,
Even from her own dismembered ^yre,
The sacred rytes she did withdraw,
Denaying wonted burial fire
This grief our woeful age does feel,
Through monstrous act against all kind,
When as in deadely crafty keele,
To TYRRHEN seas, and wrestling wynd,
The proud presuming Prince did put,
His mother trapt in subtle sort*
The Mariners appointed cut,
The swelling Seas from pleasant port.
The clash resoundes with stroke of Ores,
The Ship out launcht apace does spinne,
In surging froath aloof from shores,
And ample course of seas does win.
Which glydyng forth with leusned plankes,
In pressed streams with peysed weight,
The riftes do open closed crankes,
That hidden were with secret slight:
And gulpeth up the leaking wave
The woeful roaring noise and cry,
With woman's shrikes themselves to save*
Do reach and beat the starry sky.
Then grie^ly present death does dance
Before their eyes with pyning Cheeks:
Whose deadly stroke and heavy chance
For to avoid, then each man seeks:
On ryuened ribs some naked lie,
And cut the beating waves in twain:
And some their skilful swimming try,
To get unto the shore again.
The greatest part that sailed there,
By destnies dire to men prefixed,
In whirling swallows drowned were,
The brinkes of Seas and ground betwixt.
Queen AGRIPPYNE her garments rendes,
She tears her ruffled locks of hair
Abundant blubbring tears she spendes,
Through deep distress of faynting fear.
Who when no hope of health she spies,
Enflamde with wrath, which woes appeasde,
O son, for so great gifts, she cries,
Have thou with such reward me pleased?
This keele I have deserved sure,
That bare and brought thee first to light:
Who empire witles did procure,
And CAESAR'S title for thy right.
Show forth thy fearful spritish face,
O CLADIVS now from Limbo lake,
And of thy wife in wretched case,
Revenge and due correction take.
Thy death I causeles did conspyre,
Which now I rue with woeful heart:
I dressed eake a funeral fire
Unto thy son by deadly smart.
Lo now as I deserved have,
Vntombde go to thy guiltles Ghost,
Encloasd in seas in stead of grave,
And wrestling waves of Romayne coast.
The flasshing flawes do flappe her face,
And on her speaking mouth do beat,
Anon she sinkes a certain space,
Depressed down with surges grea:
Anon she fleetes on weltring brim,
And pattes them of with tender hands
Through faynting fear then taught to swim
Approaching death, and fates withstandes
At length on troubled Seas displayde
She giving over working vain
And tyrd with streams is weary laid,
Not able toyling strength to strain
In close and secret silent breasts,
Of mates with her to sea that yode,
In whom no fear of death there restes
True faith unto their Queen abode.
Their Ladies weather beaten limbs
To help, some freely venture dare,
Some in the combrous waters swymmes
And desperate danger do not spare.
With cheereful voice they comfort her,
Though drawling dragling limbs she drew,
To lift her up with help they stir,
And nummed corpse to strength renew.
What bootesit thee the death to shonne
Of roaring raging ravening waves.
From deadly sword of wicked son,
Alas pore wretch thee nothing saues?
Whose huge and heinous cursed rage,
Against all course of natures lore,
Our after slow believing age,
VVil scarce beleene it done before,
The deuillish man repynde with grief
When he is mother saved saw,
From swallowing seas have safe relief,
And that she vital breath did draw,
He grudgde with grief and in his heat,
He huger mischief heaps to this:
He does not once delay his feate,
But headlong rashly carried is
Upon her death. A soldier sent,
Dispatcheth that he had in charge,
His Ladies breast his blade does rent:
She yielding up her soulde at large,
From wretched corpse for to entombe
Her slaughter man she then besought,
That bloody blade within her womb,
That first this woe to her had brought,
This, this accursed breast (quoth she)
Which this unkindly monster bare,
From pinching pain may not be free:
Dig, slash the same, no mischief spare.
When this with foltring tongue was said,
At last her sad and trembling ghost,
With latter sobbing sighs vnstayd,
Through goryd wounds leaves vital coast.
ON me with like consent why did thou smile,
With glosed looks deluding me a while,
O fortune much of might and princely power?
To lift aloft to noble royal bower?
To the'nde that I to honors court extold,
From stately seat might have the greater fall,
And round about in every place behold,
Such dreadful, threating dangers to us all,
I safer lay aloof from enuyes knockes,
Removed among the craggy corsicke rocks:
Where as my mind there free at proper sway,
With leisure did repeat my studies aye.
A gladsome joy alone it was to view,
And earnestly to mark the heavens so blew:
And sacred Phoebus double wheeled wayne:
And eake the worlds swift whirling motion main.
The Sun so even his second course to keep:
And Phoebes glyding globe so swiftly sweep:
Whom wondrous starting stars encompasse round.
And to behold that shynes in every stound,
The glistring beauty bright of welkin wide:
Than which in all the world nothing beside.
Of all this huge and endless work the guide,
More wondrous nature fram'de that Iespyde,
For all the bumping bigness it does bear;
Yet waxing old is like again to wear,
And to be chaungde to an vnwyldy lump.
Now pressed at hand this worlds last day does iumpe,
With boystrous fall, and tumbling rush of sky.
To squease and make this cursed kind abye.
That springing once again, it may yield out
An other strange renewed virtuous route,
As once before it did, new sprung again,
What time Saturnus held his golden raygne.
That blameless, chaste, unspotted Virgin clear
A goddess much of might clept Justice here,
With sacred sooth sent down from heavenly space,
At ease on earth did rule the mortal race.
That people plain knew not of warlicke feats.
Nor trembling trompets tunes that rendes and beats*
The soldiers ears: nor chashing armont bright,
That warring wightes defend in field and fight.
Nor wonted was with walls to rampyre round,
Their open cities set in any stound.
To each man passage free lay open than:
Nothing there private was to any man.
And then the ground it self and fertile soil,
Her fruitful bosom baard all void of toil,
Into such bounden barnes a Matrone good,
And peaceable unto so just a brood.
But then an other second race arose,
Perceived not to be so meek as those.
A third more wise and witty sort up startes,
Of nature forged fit, t'inuent new arts:
As yet unspotted quite with filthy vice.
Soon after thoe, they raung^d with new deuyce,
That boldly venture dare in scudding race,
Unwieldy beasts for to pursue apace.
And mighty weying struggling fishes great,
With watery coats yclad with fishers feat,
With net in window wise draw forth, and streeke
With craft of quill, the nibling fysshes cheek.
And silly birds begylde with pyning train:
And light foot dear for life that flyng amayne
Intangling gins entrapt, that safely hold.
And sturdy scouling visage bulls controld,
On fleshye fillet necks, make wear the yoke:
And earth ere that vngrubbed up that broake:
Which then turned up with Plowmans shyning share,
In sacred bosom deep, her fruits kept their.
But now this age much worse then all the rest,
Has lept into her mothers broken breast:
And rusty lumpish iron and massye Gold,
Has dug out, that was quite hid with mold.
And fighting fistes have armd without delay:
And drawing forth their bonds for rule to stay,
Have certain several ioly kingdoms made,
And cities new have raysde now ruled with blade,
And fenseth either with their proper force
Strange stoundes or them assaults the which is worse.
The Starry specked virgin flower of skies.
Which Justice hight, that guilty folk discries,
Now lightly esteemd of mortal people here,
Each earthly stound is fled, and comes not near
The savage mannerd route, and beastly rude,
With dabbed wristes in goary blood embrude.
The great desire of griesly war is sprung:
And raping thurst of gold, it is not young.
Throughout the world a mighty monstrous vice,
Foul, filthy, monstrous lust has got the price,
A pleasant tickling plague, whom longer space,
And error deep have fostred up apace.
The heaps of vice rakte up in years long past,
Abounding flow in these our days at last.
And this same troublous time, and combrous age,
Oppresses all men sore, both young and sage.
Wherein those wicked ways that be do raygne,
And cruel, raumping woodnes boyles again.
Lust strong in filthy touch, does bear a sway.
And Princes, riot, now does catch away
With greedy paws, to bring it to decay.
Th whole worlds incredible wealth, without delay.
But lo, which staggring steps where Nero flinges,
And visage grymme, I fear what news he brynges.
DIspatch with speed that we commanded have:
Go, send forthwith some one or other slave,
That Plautius cropped scalpe and Sillas eke,
May bring before our face: go some man seek.
I nill protract your noble graces hest:
But to their camps to go am ready pressed.

Gaynst lynage naught should rashly poynted be.

A light thing it is for to be just, I see
For him, whose heart is void of shrinking fear.

A sovereign salve for fear is for to bear
Your self debonair to your subjects all.

Our foes to slay, a cheftaynes virtue call.

A worthier virtue it is in countries sire,
His people to defend with sword and fire.

It well beseemes such aged wightes, to teach,
Unbridled springolles young, and not to preach,
Both to a man and prince of ryper years.

May, rather frolic youthful blood appears,
To have more need of counsel wise and grave

This age sufficient reason ought to have.

That heavenly powers your doings may allow.

A madness it were to Gods for me to bow,
When I my self can make such Gods to be:
As Claudius now ycounted is we see.

So much the more because so much you may.

Our power permittes us all without denay.

Give slender trust to Fortunes flattring face:
She topsie turuy turns her wheel apace.

A patch he is that knows not what he may.

A Princes praise I compted have always,
To do that same which with his honor stood,
Not that which frantic fancy counts good.

If that I were a meacocke or a slouch,
Each stubborn, clubbish daw would make me couch.

And whom they hate, with force they ouerquell.

Then dynt of sword the prince defends well.

But faith more sure defense does seem to me.

Full meet it is that Caesar dreaded be.

More meet of subjects for to be beloved

From subjects minds, fear must not be removed

What so by force of arms you do wringe out,
A grievous work it is to bring about.

Well hardly then our will let them obey.

Will nothing then, but that which well you may.

We will decree what we shall best suppose.

What peoples voice does jointly bynd or lose.
Let that confirmed stand.

Swords bloody dynt,
Shall cause them else at me to take their hint.

God sheeld, and far that fact from you remove.

What then, why Senec do you that approve,
That we contemnde, despysde and set at naught,
With finger put in hole (full wisely wrought)
Our bodies blood to seek should them abide,
That they might us sometime destroy vnspyde?
Their native country bounds to banished be,
Nor Plautius breast nor Scillas eake we see
Has broke or camd: whose cankred churlish ire,
Shapes bloody freakes to quench our bodies fire.
And chiefly when these traiterous absent clounes,
Such wondrous favor find in cities bownes,
Which those same exiles lingering hope does feed:
Suspected foes with sword we will out weed.
And so Octauia shall that ioly dame,
Continue after them their bloody game.
And wend that way her nowne white brother went,
Such hye mistrusted things must needs be bent.

It is (O Prince) a worthy famous thing,
Amids redoubted Lords alone to ring:
And wisely work your countries praise to save:
And well your self to captive folk behave:
From cruel brutish slaughter to abstain,
And void of mood to wreake your angry pain:
And to the world a quiet calm to give,
That al your age in peace their lives may live.
This is a Princes praise without al crime:
This is the path to heaven whereby we clyme.
So is Augustus prince and father called
Of country first in starbright throne ystald.
Whom as a God in minsters we adorn,
Yet troublous fortune tossed him beforne,
A great while long on lands and ruffling seas,
Until his fathers foes he could appease,
And throught wars diverse course could quel them quite.
To you did fortune yield her power, and might,
And raynes of rule without all blood, and fight.
And to your beck both land, and seas has bent.
Grim deadly envy daunted does relent.
The Senate Lords gave place with free consent:
The battaylous route of knights with willing hearts
(That same decree from sager sires departes)
Unto the lay men's choice do well agree.
Your grace the spring of peace they count to be.
And chosen Judge, and guide of mortal stock.
Your grace, your countries sacred sire, does rock
And rule with princely gorgeous title bright,
The cyrcled world in rundel wise ydight.
Which mighty mounting name to keep so great,
This noble city Rome does you entreat:
And does commend unto your royal grace
Her lively limbs in charge for your lives ^pace.

The gift of Gods it is, as we discus,
That Rome with Senafe sort does honor us,
And that the fear of our displeasure great,
From cankred enuyous stomachs makes sweat
Both humble talk and supplications meek.
And were not fear all these would be to seek.
Unwieldy, combrous cities, members ill,
That Prince and country both do seek to spill,
To leave alive (which swell, and puffed be,
Because of lynage great. and high degree)
What madness mere is it when as we may,
Even with a word, such freakes dispatch away*
Sir Brutus stern, his brawnes and arms did dight,
His soueraygne liege to slain by force and might,
That erst had helped him, and given him health,
And had endued him with princely wealth,
In brunt of raging war undaunted out,
That vanquished many people strong and stout,
Prince Caesar matched by great degrees of power
To love, in stately chair of starry bower,
By diu'lish citizens wicked wyle was slain.
What store of bloody stiffling streams on molde.
Did tatred Rome, of her own lims, behold?
He by his noble virtues worthy praise,
Who^ peoples, common brute to heaven does raise.
August among the Gods ysayncted well,
How many noble breasts did he compel,
How many springoldes young, and hoary heads,
Each where dispersed to lig in molded heds?
How many men did he bereave of breath
Tofore proscript that were condemnd to death?
When for the griesly fear of deadly dart
From propre home they were constraind to part
And fly Octauius force, and Lepidus might,
And not abide stern Mark Antonius sight,
Which then the ample world at once did guide,
That into kingdoms three they did deuyde,
To dumpish sadded syres, with heavy cheer,
Their childrens grie^ly cropped pates appear,
Hong out beforne the Senates judgment seat,
For each man to behold in open streate:
Ne durst they once lament their piteaus case,
Nor inward seem to mourn to Claudius face,
The market stead with blood from bodies spued,
And loathsome mattrie streams, is all imbrued:
And quite throughout their faces foul arrayed,
The piteous gubbes of blood drop down vnstayd.
Nor here did this same slaughterous bloodshed stay.
Phillyps Pharsalia ghastly fields each day,
The cromming ravening fowls, and cruel beasts
Long fed, with gobbe^s big of manlye breasts,
Beside all this, the cost he scoured quite*
Of Sicill sea and ships to ware ydyght
With force of arms did win, and havoc made
Of propper snbiectes slain with his own blade.
The rundle round of lands with mighty main
Of noble Chieftaynes stroke reboyles again.
Antonius overcome in Nauale fight,
To Egypt poastes in ships preparde to flight:
Not looking long to live nor hoping life.
Incesteous Egypt (through Antonius wife)
That worthy Romayne princes blood did suck*
And couerd lie their ghostes with durty mucke.
Long wicked, waged civil war there stayed,
In Marcke Antonius grave with him ylayed.
Augustus at the last of conquest great
His dulled swords that wounded souls did beat,
In peaceable sheathes repos^d has laid at rest:
And fear does rule, and guide his kingdom best
By ready force of arms at all assayes,
And Captains faith he shieldes him self always
Who^ now his sons most worthy virtuous praise,
To heaven a consecrated God does raise,
And causes all, in Churches for to place
The sacred Picture of Prince Claudius grace,
And us the starry reign of Gods shall bide
If first with dreadful sword about us wide
We wype away what so our person stayne:
And found our court with worthy stem again.

Your noble spouse, sprung forth of saincted peer
Of Claudius stock, the starbright diamond clear,
That Goddess Juno wise her brothers bed*
Partaking, pressed down with buttockes red,
Your graces princely court shall garnish gay,
With wondrous heavenly fair descended stay.

Incestuous married dames, from stock and stem,
Detract all hope, that we should have of them.
Nor us, could she once love that we could see,
Nor with our person once at all agree

In tender budding years, when love suppressed
With blusshing hydes the flames of burning breast,
Scant plain appears the love they bare indeed.

Thus we our selves with hope in vain did feed:
Although undoubted signs, as body wryed,
And frowning looks, which we have often espied,
Her spyteful hating stomach did bewray
Which she does bear, whom duty byndes t'obaye.
Which yet at last, big, boiling, grievous pain,
With death determind has t^auenge again,
We have found out, for birth and beauties grace.
A worthy make for such an Empress place:
To whom that lovely goddess Venus bright,
And mighty Jove his spouse that Juno hight,
and goddess fierce in boisterous warlike arts,
Geues place for bodies seemly portrayed parts.

Faith, meeknes, manners mild, and bashful shame*
Of spouse, those ought an husband to reclayme.
The perles of judging mind, alone remain,
Not subject once to any rulers raygne.
The passing pride of beautyes numming grace
Each day appalls, and bleamisheth apace.

What praises woman wights have in them closd*
All those in her alone has God repo^de,
And such a peerlesse peer, the guydes of life,
The destnies would have borne to be our wife,

O noble prince such blind unlawful love,
(Do rashly credit naught) from you remove.

Whom Jove can not repel that rules the clouds,
And pearcing raging floods, therein him shroudes,
And raungeth through the reign of Plutoes pit,
And pulls down in welkin hie that sit
The mighty powers of heaven, the God of love?
And can I then his force from me remove?

Swift winged love, men's fancy fond, in vain
A mercy wanting God to be, does feign:
And arms his hands with woundinge weapons keen
And bows with burning brondes, for lovers green:
Of Venus to be sprung they al accord,
and blyndly forgde of thunders limping Lord.
Bland love the minds great torment sore appears,
And buddeth first in frolic youthful years.
Who while we drink of Fortunes pleasant cup,
With laysie pampring riot, is nes^led up:
Whom if to toster up you leave at length
It fleeting, falls away with broken strength.
This is in all our life (as I suppose)
The greattest cause how pleasure first arose.
Which since mankind by broodyng bydeth aye,
Through gladsom love y^ fierce wild beasts does sway
It never can from manly breast depart.

This self same God I wish withal my heart
The wedlock lights to bear before our grace,
And fasten Poppie sure in our bed place.

The peoples grief might never yield to it:
Nor ver^ue can the same at all permit.

Shall I alone to do, forbidden be
That every patch may do? that grieueth me

No tryfling toys the people looks to have
Of him, that ought to rule with wisdom grave.

It pleases us with daunted power to try,
If peoples rash conceived rage will fly.

Seek rather for to please and calm their mood.

Ill ruled is that raygne where people wood,
Their subject Prince does weld, as they think good

When naught that they require they can obtain,
They justly then agrieued are again.

That gentle prayers cannot win with ease,
By force to wring it out, it does us please.

An hard thing it is the people not to have
That of their Prince, which they do justly crave.

And horrible it is a Prince to be constraynd.

Let not your subjects then so sore be raynd.

Why then the common brute abroad will be.
How that the people have subdued me.

That no man trustes that is of credit light.

Be it so, yet many it marks with deadly spyghte.

With country peers to meddle it is afraid,

To quip and frump, it is nothing less dismayed.

Your grace may easly couch that budding brute
Let Sayncted sires deserts with pliant suit,
Your graces mind remove: let spouses age,
And courteous bashful shame disrumpe your rage.

Leave off (I say) that we entend to grutch.
For now your talk our patience moves much:
I pray you let it lawful be to do,
That Senec gives not advise unto.
And we our peoples wishes do defer,
While Poppie feel in wombling womb to sterre,
The pledge of faithful love to me and her.
Why do we not appoint the morrow next,
When as our marriage pomp may be context?

THrough paunch of riuened earth, from Plutoes reign
With ghostly steps, I am returned again.
In writhled wristes, that blood do most desire,
Forguyding wedlock vile with Stygian fire.
Let Poppie, which these cressets coupled sure,
Unto my son be joined in marriage pure:
Whom mothers grief, and hand revenging wrackes,
Shall send with heave and hoe to funeral stackes
I always do remember well beneath
Where piteous, ghostly, crauling souls do breath,
Th'unkindly slaughterous deed, which to our spright
Yet vnreuengd is grievous and of right:
And for the good I did a cruel prise,
That deadly framed ship in crafty wise:
And due reward that he gave me again,
For helping him to rule of Empyres raygne:
And eake that night, when as I did bewail,
Both loss of ship wherein we then did sail,
And mates unhappy death, and while I thought,
For this accursed deed to have besought
The Gods to trickling tears he gave scant time
But twice increased has his deuillish crime.
Quite slain with sword, thrust through my bodies bounds
And silthy laid through goary mattring wounds,
Delivered safe from seas, devouring sup,
In antique court my ghost I yielded up.
Nor yet his cancred, and unsatiate hate.
For all this blood does Nero once abate.
That Tyrant dyre does rage at mothers name.
And seeks ways my deeds for to defame.
Who threating death to them that do withstand,
My shapes he dingeth down in every land:
My princely tytles large he scrapeth out
In every place, the whole wydeworld about,
Which my unlucky parents love did give,
To much unto my pain while I did live,
Unto a boy to guide, which now I rue.
My poisoned make, my Ghost does often pursue:
And in my face with burning brondes does fly.
He stays a space with earnest talk hard by,
And threatens sore, and does impute his death
And tomb he should have had to me beneath.
And now desires to have some factious wight,
That dare despayle my son of breathing spright.
Let be you shall have one to work this crime,
I do require no long delayed time.
Revenging spright Erin, a death does coin,
Of life, that wicked tyrant to purloyne.
Sore smarting leaden strypes and shameful flight,
And pyning panges with thurst and hunger dight:
That Tantalus spungelike thursty mouth befurde,
And Sisyphus toil shall pass, and Tityus burde,
And Ixions paynful wombling wheel about,
That teareth all his bodies parts throughout.
Although that Tyrant proud and scornful wight,
His court with marble stone do strongly dyght,
And princelike garnish it with glistring gold:
Though troops of soldiers shielded sure, uphold
Their chieftaynes princely porch: and though yet still
The world drawn dry with taskes even to his will,
Great heaps of riches yield themselves to save,
Although his bloody help the Parthians crave,
And Kingdoms bring, and goods all that they have,
The time and day shall come, when as he shall
Forlorn, and quite undone, and wanting all.
Unto his cursed deeds his life and more,
Unto his foes his bared throat restore.
Alas, unto what end is all my pain?
Or in what case do now my vows remain?
Whereto does now thy rage and destnies spyte?
Draw thee O Son, with brain benumbed quite?
That to such monstrous heaps of ylles thy dame
(Whom thou with cursed mischief overcame)
Her wrath should yield? O that ere to the light
A sucking babe I brought thee forth in sight,
And fedd thee fine with pappe as princely borne,
The fierce, wild, savage beasts had rent and torn
My womb and bloody entrails all beforne.
Without all crime, and wanting reasons pride,
Mine own dear da^dling child thou should have did.
And fastened sure to me should aye behold,
The quiet place, where Ghostly souls be rolde:
And see thy graundsyres great of worthy fame,
And sire Domitius eake of princely name,
Whom now both shame and wayling does abide,
That while they dure, from them shall never slide.
For which both thee, O cursed Barn, they may,
And me, that thee have borne geeue thanks for aye.
But why cease I, with hell to hyde my face,
Wife, stepdame, mother dire, in my life space?
DO not, alas, thus sore lament,
But rather yet your mourning stay,
Since that the city whole is bent
To celebrate this joyful day:
Least your great love and favor both,
Which I do count to be most sure,
The more cause Nero me to loath,
And eake his bitter wrath procure:
And I fall out to be the ground
To you of many mischieues vile,
This same is not the first deep wound,
That I have felt now this good while:
Far worse then this have I abode:
But of these troublous cares this day
Shall make an end I trust in God,
Although with Death he do me pay,
No man to see shall me constrayne
His bended brows knit furrowyse,
Nor step within the Chamber ragyne
Of maid dressed up in brydall guise
Augustus sister I will be,
And not his wife as wont I was:
But only pains remove from me,
And fear of death I will not pass.
Yet can thou piteous wreth once trust,
Thy cruel husbands father law,
Or these few things to have so lust
While mischieues yet in mind are raw?
Now long reserud, until this day,
And these same marriage rytes be past,
Thou shall poor wretch without delay,
A bloody offering dye at last.
Why thus with tears disfigured sore
Thy wonted home do thou behold?
Make have to shun this deadly shore
And leave this straughtrous Princes fold.
Lo see that day suspecttd long
And whispered Fame in all men's ears,
With glisteryng pomp of brydall throng,
To us pore wretches now appears.
And Claudius brood Octauias grace,
From Neroes wedlock place expelde,
Departed is, whose spousall space,
Has Poppie conqueror long time held.
The while, our pyety couched lies
Kept down with heavy, combrous fear.
And slow revenging grief likewise:
Where does the peoples power appear,
That brake the force of Princes great,
That conquerous city laws has framde,
That worthy men to honors ^eat
Preferred, that war and peace proclaymd,
That savage people strange did tame
That Kings and Princes caught in fight
Shut surely up in prison frame
To keep them close from all men's sight
Lo, which we cannot once abide,
To see where Poppies image trym,
Conjoined unto Neroes side
All glistring bright shynes very brim.
Let force of Arms pull down that frame
And match with ground that Ladies face
Too likely carved to his name,
And snatch her down from beddig place,
And let it forthwith fly with brandes*
With Darts and Iauelins fiercely flonge,
From pythy braunes and sturdy hands
Unto the princes courtly throng.

FRom out of spousal bower dismayed with fear,
Whither go you? what secrets daughter dear
Unknown, makes you to look so drousely?
Why spungelike lokes your face with tears from eye
That fell? of truth the time desired long,
And wished for by prayers, and vows among
Has shyned bright. Caesar's wedlock are you:
Your golden grace, whereof he took the view.
Him prisoner caught, and did him surely bind,
So much the more, how much Senec his mind
Did seek to change, and wild from love to weeld.
And Venus chief in love has made him yield.
O in beauty passing all, what beds then down
More soft, have borne thy weight when thou with crown
Did sit in mids of court the Senate all.
At thy great beauty aghast, thou did appall.
Whylst thou the Gods with perfume sendest fine,
And sacred alters drencht with thankful wine,
Thy head attyrd with veyle of yellow hiew
By Caesar's side thou wentst as princess new:
When he aloft extold above the rest,
With hauty courage merrily went to feast.
Like as king Peleus went sometimes to take
Queen Tethis, whom salt seas foam bred, his make.
Whose bridinge chambers, banquet wise ydrest,
The Gods vouchsaft to hallow with their hest,
Both they that rule in skies and eake in Seas.
But tell, O Lady, tell, if it you please,
What sudden chance does shade your beautyes light.
What means your color change from red to white?
What moves those trickling tears, how stands your plight?
With dreams, and griesly sightes, this last night, Nurse,
My mind was troubled sore, but frayd much worse.
For when sir Phoebe his weary course had ryd,
While quiet restyng night each thing shadid,
My senses weary fell in slumber deep,
While Nero me within his arms did cleepe.
Resolving lims, at length began sleep discharge,
And long I rest not under quiets targe,
For lo, I saw a route that brought me fear,
Come to my chaumber with disheueled hair:
The Matrons sage of Latin land did mourn,
And sounded shryking sighs as though forlorn
They were, the dolefulst wightes that live on ground.
And often among the warlike trumpets sound,
I saw my husbands mother teribly stand,
With threatening look berayed with b^oud in hand
A light fire brand she bare which often she shook,
And made me go with her through fearful look.
When down we came through opened earth she led
The way, I after went with bowing head,
And musing much thereat, mark what I say,
My bed, me thought I saw, wherein I lay,
When first espousde I was to Rufe Chrispyne*
And he me thought, with first son of his line,
With many following them against me fast
Did come, and me to cleepe did swift his have,
And as he wonted was he ki^^ me often,
Then rusht into my house with pace not soft
Amassed Nero sore, in Chryspines breast
That hid his faulchion ^ene: fear shakte of re^t
From me: I trembling stood with quiuering fear,
And breast dismayed to speak made me forbear.
Til now (O Nurse) I met with thee, whose trust,
And faith into these words have made me brust.
Alas, what threatens me each griesly spright?
What means of husbands blood that doleful ^ight?

^he hidden sacred vain that moves swift,
Which fantasy we call by secret drift,
When we do take our rest does show again,
The things both good and bad that broyle in brain:
You marvel that you saw your make, and bower,
His ghostly funeral stackes, at that same hour
Round clasped close in arms of husband new:
Hereto, the beaten breasts with hands moved you,
And maidens hair, on marriage day displayed:
Octauias friends with heavy hearts bewrayed,
Amids her brothers both and fathers hall
Their heavy cheer for her unlucky fall.
That dreadful blasing flame of fire forborne
In Agryppynas hand your grace beforne.
Which you did follow streigth declares renown
To you, though envy strive to keep it ^owne:
The seat you saw beneath does promise you
Your sta^e to stand full sure not changing new:
That Nero prince in Crispins throat did hyde
His sword, it tells that he in peace shall bide,
Unknown to bloody ruthful war for aye.
Therefore (Madam) pluck up your heart I pray:
Receive both mirth and glee cast fear aside,
With joy, and ease you may in bower abide.

To temples hie where mighty Gods do dwell,
I will repair, and offringes to them fell
In humble wise their heavy wrath t'ppease,
And me of mighty sight, and dreams to ease.
My second wish shall be, that this fear all
Upon my foes as sudden chance may fall.
O Nurse pray thou for me some vows do make
Toth' Gods, that ghostly fear his flight my take.

IF stealth discloasde by blabbing fame,
And lusty, pleasant, thankful love,
Of JOVE be true: who form did frame
Of swan to come from skies above,
And did enjoy the sweet consent
Of Lady LEDAS loves delight:
Who like a Bull his labor spent,
Through flowing floods to carry quite,
EVROPA slily stolen away:
He will no doubt leave raygne of Sky
And POPPIES love disguisd assaye*
If he her soueraygne beauty spy.
Which he might well prefer before
Fair LAEDAS sugared sweet delight:
And DANAE whom he won of yore,
Amasde with golden shoure so bright:
Let SPARTE now for HELENS sake
Of beauty bragging fame vprayse:
Admit the TROJAN heardman make
Of gained spoil tryumphant praise:
Fair HELEN here is stained quight:
Whose beauty bredde such boiling ire,
That earth was matched even in sight
With TROJAN towers consumde with fire.
But who is this that runs with fear oppressed?
Or else what news bringes he in panting breast?
WHat sturdy champion stout does joy with glee
Our chieftaynes royal bower safe to see,
Then to his court I counsel him to wend,
Against which the populus rout their force does bend.
The rulers run amasde to fetch the guard,
And armed troops of men, their town to ward.
Nor woodnes rashly cought through fear does cease,
But more and more, their power does increase.
What sudden rage does beat their br^^ling brain?

The garrisons great with fury astonde again,
And sturred up for Queen Octauias sake
With monstrous mischief vile, their rage to slake,
They rumbling rush into the Palace far.

What dare they do, their counsailers who are?

Advance their Empress old, suburt the new:
And grant her, brothers beds as is her due.

Which Poppie now, with hole consent does hold?

Yea that unbridled rage in breast vprold,
Sets them agog, and makes them wondrous wood.
What ever image graven in marble stood,
If Poppies badge it bare, or if in sight,
It tended for to show her beauty bright,
Though it on heavenly altares brave did stand,
They break, or pull it down, with sword or hand.
Some parts with ropes sure tide, they trayle the^ forth
Which spurnd with durty feet, as though naught worth
With ^^^thy stinking mire, they it all beray.
And with their deeds their talk does iumpe agree,
Which mine amassed mind, thinks true to be
For fiery flames they threat for to prepare,
Wherewith to waste, the princes Palace fair,
Unless, unto their furious mood he give
His second wife, and with Octauia live,
But he by me shall know in what hard stay
The City stands: the rulers I Will obey.

A lack, what made you cruel wars, in vain
To move, since prisoner love you can not gaine^
You can not him overcome, your fiery flame
He recketh not: his sire ouercomes the same.
He darkened has those thundering thumps that shake
Heaven, Earth, Hell, sea, al things y^ makes to quake.
Yea mighty Jove, in heaven that wears chief crown
His flames from welkin hie has brought adowne.
And you, not victors now, but vanquished,
Shall rau^some pay, the price of hearts blood red.
Love, pacient can not be, but hot in rage,
No easy thing it is, his wrath t'as^wage,
Achilles worthy ^ight, that was so stout,
To twang the Harp he made in Ladies rout,
Prince Agamemnon stern that boy benund,
And rabble rude of Greeks with love bronds bumd.
King Priams reign he topsie tu^uie tossed,
And goodly Cities great he chiefly lost.
And now my mind ^ore frighted stands aghast,
What Cupides furious force brings us at last.

AH, ah, our captains sl^e dispatching coil,
And our long suffering y^e in such a broyle,
That streams of blood yet do not ^ue^^h their rage
Which they against our propre person wage
And that all Rome, with corses strewed about,
Those cruel villains blood, does not sweat out.
But deeds already done, with death to pay.
A small thing it is, a greater slaughtrous day
The peoples cursed crime, and eke that dame,
Whom I did aye suspect, deserves the same.
whom, to yield those peasaunts would me make:
At last she shall, with life our sorrow slake,
And with her bodies blood shall quench our ire.
Then, shall their houses fall by force of fire:
What burning both, and buildings fair decay,
What beggarly want, and wayling hunger may
Those villains shall be sure, to have each day.
Ah, Proue^der pricks that vile rebellious race
Ne can they once our favor well embrace,
Nor be content, with peace in quiet state,
But broyling raumpe about with troubled gate.
Hereon with boldness straight, hereon they fly,
With harebraind rashness hedlong by and by.
Well, they must tamed be with heavy stroke,
And down be kept with peise of weighty yoke:
That they, with like attempt, do not arise,
Nor once cast up their deadly peasaunts eyes,
Against our loving spouses golden looks:
First punish them sure, then fear shall be their books,
To teach them, at their Princes beck t'obay
But see at hand, whom faith, and virtue rare,
Lieuetenant chief of camps, appointed their.
THe vulgar peoples rash unruly rage
The slaughter of a few did sone assuage,
Which long wtstode our valiant force in vain*
To tell your grace this news, I come again*
And is this then enough, do thou so well*
O soldier mark what does thy captain tell?
Have thou with held thy hand frou bloody ire?
Is this the due revenge that we require?

The captain guides of treason paid their hyre,
By desperate death of bloody sword in fight.
The route which sought with flaming fire to light,

Our royal Palace great, who would assign
Their Prince what he should do: and pull in fine
Our mate from us dissoluing wedlock bands:
Whose hardy slanderous tongs, and wicked hands,
Her princely grace reprochfully withstandes,
From due revenge, are they dismissed free?

Shall subjects pain, by grief assigned be?

It shall assign which time shall never wear.

Which neither wrath may end, nor yet your fear*

She shall appease our hie displeased mind,
Who fiyrst, our wrath deserved due to find.

Declare whose death your mood does most require
Let not my hand be stayde from your desire.

It seeks our sisters death, and traiterous head.

Those words through all my luns, has stifnessespred,
Oppressed with griesty fear.

Us to obey.
Stands thou in doubt:

On faith why do you lay
So great a fault?

Because thou sparedst our foe.

Deserves a woman to be termed so?

If treason she begin.

Is any man
So sure, that hit accuse of creason can:

The peoples rage:

Those mad vnweldye wights
Who order could?

Who could stir up their sprits?

No creature as I think.

A woman could,
In whom a mind Dame nature has vpfould,
To mischief prone: she armed has her heart,
To hurt by wyles: yet strength she set apart,
Least she undaunted force with her should bear:
But now her slender power with doubting fear,
Is quickly quaylde, or else with punishment,
Which her condenmed state to mischief bent
To late does end: away with grave advise,
Us with entreating seek not to entyse.
Dispatch that we comm^und on shipboorde horn,
Far off to shore aloof with dashing worn,
Command she be: that tunlike swelling breast
At length in storming stomach may take rest.

ALack the peoples bitter love,
And dyre good will to many one,
Which, when they hoysted sails above,
With pleasant blastes it made to groan,
And carried them from quiet shore,
That faynting, leaves them in the deep,
And tumbling, raging waters rore.
Cornelia piteous wretch did weep,
And sore bewail her sons estate:
The peoples love did undo them,
And wondrous favor, bred them hate:
Great worthy peers of noble stem:
Of high renown for virtues praise:
In faith and eloquence did pas
Their stomachs stout their fame did raise:
Ith laws each one most excellent was.
And Scipio, thee did Fortune yield
Unto like death, and curssed wrack,
Whom neither honors pomp could sheelde,
Nor fenced house thy foes keep back.
More to repeat, although I could,
Pure present grief forbids sore:
Ere while to whom the people would,
Her Fathers antique Court restore,
And Brothers wedlock once again,
Now weeping, wringing hands poor wretch,
Unto her cruel, deadly pain,
The armed soldiers do her fetch.
How safe does poverty lie content,
In thetched house safe shrouded there?
High raised towers with blasts are bent,
Which often times them over bear.
Where pull you me poor wretch? alas,
Into what banished exiles place,
Would Nero have me for to pass,
Or Fortune bids, with frowning face?
If now with faynting strength quite coolde,
And with my broils all wearied cease,
And longer life she grant me woolde,
If that she work for to increase,
My sorrows great with deadly dart,
Why is she then so much my foe,
In country that I may not part,
And leave my life before I go?
But now no help of health I feel,
Alas I see my Brothers boat:
This is the same, whose vaulted keele,
His Mother once did set a clote.
And now his piteous Sister I,
Excluded clean from spousall place,
Shall be so carried by and by:
No force has virtue in this case.
No Gods there be my woes to wrecke.
The griefly, dreadful drab Eryn,
Does weld the world at nod and beck,
Who can lament my state, wherein
I am, alas, sufficiently?
How can Aedon duly plain,
My smarting streams at bears that I
Do shed? whose wings I would be fame,
If destnies would them grant, to wear.
Then would I leave my mourning mates,
As swiftly fled, as wings could bear,
And so avoid these bloody pates.
Then sitting sole in shirwood shirle,
And hanging sure, by dandling twigge
With plaintiue pipe I might out twarle
My heavy tuned note so big.

The mortalt brood the destnies guide:
Themselves they nothing can assure,
That certainly does steadfast bide:
Which our last day of life, procure,
(Where of we always should beware,)
Much dangerous chances for to try:
Unto your troubled mind with care,
Now many saumples do applys,
Which your accursed court has brought,
To holden you in all your broyle:
For what has more your troubles wrought,
What does against you sorer toil,
Than fortune does? the first of all,
Agrippas child brought forth to life,
Whom we Tyberius daughter call,
By law, and eke Prince Caesar's wife,
Of many sons a careful dame,
I cannot chose but now recount,
Whose worthy, glorious ample name,
Throughout the world does much surmount.
So often with belly bolne that bare
Desired fruicts, and peaces pledge,
Ere long thou sufferedst exiles care,
Strypes, chains, and boltes of iron wedge,
And mourning much, which so did frame,
That death they causde thee to abide.
So Liuia, Drusus lucky name
In male kind babes, did hedling slide,
Into a cruel monstrous deed,
And death sore pearcing deadly dart.
Her mothers fates does Iulia speed,
To follow straight with all her heart,
Who after longer wasted time
With bloody fauchion kene, was slain,
Although for no just cause or crime.
Your mother eke that once did reign,
Who then esteemd of Claudius well,
Did wisely weld his court at will,
And fruitful was, as you can tell,
What could not her desire fulfill:
She sometime subject to her slave,
To death was put with soldiers blade.
What she, that easly hope might have,
Toth skies, her reign to rise have made,
Prince Neroes lusty Parent great?
First tossed with shipmans boisterous force,
Then torn with sword in Princes heat,
Did she not lie a senceles corse,

Lo me the tyrant stern will send
To yrcksome shades and hellish sprits.
Why wretch do I the tyiue thus spend?
Draw me to death you to whose myghts,
False Fortune has bequeathed me.
I witness now the heavenly power.
What do thou bedlame? leave to flee,
With prayer to Gods, who on thee lowre.
I call to witness Tartar deep,
And sprytes of Hell revenging freakes
Of heinous facts, in D^^geon steep,
And Sire whom death deserved wreakes.
I do not now repyne to dye,
Deck up your Ship, and hoyse your Sail,
On frothing seas to winds on hye:
Let him that guides the Helm not fail,
To seek the shore of Pharian Land.

O pippling puff of western wind,
Which sacrifice did once with stand,
Of Iphigen to death asfignde
And close in Cloud congealed clad,
Did carry her from smoking aa^es,
Which angry, cruel Virgin had:
This Prince also oppressed, with cares,
Save from this paynefull punishment,
To Dians temple safely horn:
The harbarous Moors toru^enesse bent,
Then Princes Courts in Rome forlorn,
Have far more Cyuile curt^sie:
For there does strangers death appease
The angry Gods in heavens on hie,
But Romayne blood, our Rome must please.
