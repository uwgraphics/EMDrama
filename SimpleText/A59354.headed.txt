There his Lordship, and the several Companies Landing from their Respective

his Lordship is Saluted with the First Pageant

ON a large Stage are Erected Four Antique Pedestals, upon which are planted
Four Urnes of Gold, from which issue forth Four Trees sprinkled with
Golden-Nutmegs. In the Center is planted a large Camel of Gold, being the Creft
of the Honorable Company; on which rides a beautiful Figure, richly and
properly Dressed, representing Fame; Below, on each fide of the Stage, are placed
Four Figures more, viz. Justice, Mercy, Equity, and Law

IF Monarchs in their Sovereign Command,
In no less Post than Heavens Vicegerents stand;
And, in the Second Sphere of Government,
The Magistrate dos the Crown'd-Head Present;
Hayl then, My LORD, to Your Praetorian Seat,
Where both the Caears and Heavens Image meet:
And here 'twixt Justice, Equity, and Law,
So near the Life Your Great Originals draw;
Till Your Augusta's Heart, so all Your Own,
You fix the CHAIR the Copy af the THRONE:
Whilst 'twixt her Ecchoing Praise and Bended Knee,
You make Your Happy Year a Jubilee,
Thus shall You Eternize Your Hononour'd Name,
And never want the loudest Trump of Fame.
A Large Chariot splendidly Imbellished with all manner of Enrichments of
Silver, as Lions Heads, Large Shields, Noble Festoons, and Embossed Goloss; The
Wheels likewise are Silver. Beneath the Chariot Wheels are Piles of Trophies,
all of Silver, viz, Helmets, Targets, Armory of all sorts, etc. This Chariot is
drawn by Two stately Griffons, the Companys Supporters, on whose Backs are
seated Two Princely Figures, Representing Asia and America; as being those
Parts of the World whence the Spicery and other Grocery are Imported. In this
Chariot fits a Figure Representing Victory, Attended by Six more Figures
Personating Wisdom, Policy, Labor, Industry, Vigor, and Vigilance

WHilst Victory, with all her ecchoing Praise,
Dos the Great WILLIAM's Deathless Honor raise,
Is it the Hero's only Crowned? And grows
The Laurel only for the Warriour's Brows?
No! Peace her Trophies has, as well as War:
Your Lordship with Great Caesar shares thus far;
He in his Martial, You Your Justice Seat;
Whilst He in Foreign Fields in Fame so Great,
His Sword and Shield his Glittering VVreath Secures,
Your Sword and Scales at Home shall Plant You Yours.
This Difference, it is true, Your Toyls attends;
His Foes He Conquers, You shall win his Friends.
Thus both the Prince and Magistrate shall join,
Both Glories Tune One Harmony Divine:
Your Olive-Garland, with his Bays shall Shine.
IN the Center of a very large Stage is Erected a Magnificent Pile, as the
Shrine of St. Anthony, Patron to the Honorable Company; In this Pile, under
Four Arches fits St. Anthony and Three more Attendants, Representing India,
Persia, and Arabia; The whole is Environed with Twelve Pedestals, bearing as
many Large Golden-Urnes, from whence Issue Cinnamon-Trees, Richly Ornamented
with Flowers, Blossoms, Golden-Fruit, etc. Within the Body of this Pageant are
several Persons in Rural Habits, as Negroes, Tauneys, Virginia-Planters, etc.
All exercised in Imitation of their several Employments. The whole Pageants all
Adorned with Flags and Streamers

WHilst Proud St. Anthony, in his Spicy Plains,
The Honorable Grocers Patron Raigns;
It Is here my Aromatic Odours spring;
And my Rich Fruits their fragrant Harvest bring.
But hold! -- From my poor Throne, I must remove,
It Is You're the Lord of all my Balmy Grove:
It Is from Your Smiles alone each kind Perfume,
And all my Oriental Sweets must Bloom.
Sweets did I say! You Have Sweets yet more Refined;
Virtue and every Grace that decks Mankind.
Virtue a Plant of Paradise may boast,
The Original Offspring of the Eden Coast:
Nor let the Famous Bird of the Fair East
Vaunt her Proud Urne of that Rich-Mass possessed;
It Is Virtue only Builds the Spicy Neft.
GRin Malice, burst Envy, cheer Albion, sing Fame.
It Is all a just Tribute to NASSAU's Great Name;
He comes! And, hark, round
The Hosannas resound.
In his Chariot Triumphant the Hero dos move,
Whilst His own Grateful Thunder salutes our dear JOVE.
The Virgins strew Flowrs, and the Matrons they Pray,
The Nymphs on the Plains, and the Shepherds they Play.
The Groves they all Ring,
Whilst the Nightingales Sing
And the Lark to the Skies the sweet Harmony bears,
Till the Gods join in the Chorus and new Tune their Spears.
He comes, yes he comes, but more strong to Return:
His Friends they Rejoice, but His Foes they must Mourn.
His bold Pen of Steel,
Has yet Volumes to fill;
For the brave British LION the Lillies must Win.
He began at the Boyne, and shall end at the Seine.
