HEre you're all met, and look for a set speech,
Put into Rhyme, to court you, and beseech
Your Worships, but to hear and like the Play,
But I, I vow, have no such part to say.
I Am sent a woing to you, but how to do 't,
I have not the skill; it is true I Have a new Suite,
And Ribbons fashionable, y^lipt Fancies,
But for the Complements, the Trips, and Dances,
Our Poet cannot abide um, and he swears,
They Are all but cheats; and sugared words but jeeres.
He Is harkening there: and if I go about
To make a Speech, he vows, h^'le put me out.
Nor dare I write t'you: therefore in this condition,
I Will turn my courtship into admonition.
When a good thing is profer'd, don't be nice,
Our Poet vows, you shall not be profer'd twice.

The Scene LONDON.

THou have delivered my Letter?


Yes Sir, to Mr. Saveall your Unkles friend: But he has stood your friend so
long, and so often, to so little purpose in moving your Uncle for you, that he
holds it utterly in vain, to urge him any further, he told me


Thou should have told him, I would not be so answered.


Yes; and then he would have told me, let your Master take his course.


Then you should have told him again, I have taken all the courses I could, or
as any Gentleman can to maintain my self like one; But all my courses are run
out, and I have not breath, nor know any ground whereon to begin a new one,
unless that thing my Uncle sets me up again, nor have I any means to attain
to that, but by his Mediation


Then would he have told me again, what all your courses have been. Namely,
running into debt by all the ways can be imagined, and cheating by all could
be invented, then that the said thing, (as you call it) your Uncle, before he
cast you quite off, had redeemed you out of Prison, and several holds, within
the space of 15. Months 14. times


That was not once a Month then, or if it had, what had that been to him?
'twas I that suffered, thou should have told him, not he


He would have told me then again, That several Redemptions, cost your Uncle
at least 2000 l. And that upon your last revolt when he quite gave you over for
a castaway, two years since, he cast the third thousand with you, upon
condition never to afflict him more. And then he Married in hope to get an
heir


I that Marrying spoy'ld all.


Because you should not after his death cast away all the rest of the
thousands, and ten thousands which you might have lived to inherit, if your
Unkles love or Mr. Savealls counsel could have prevay'd with you against the
Divill, and Debauchednes


Pox on it, let it all go, let that wretched Uncle go, and let Saveall go for
a punctual ass as he is. I confess he has by his saving help peec'd me
with my Uncle a score of times at least. What had once more been to him


Sir, it were better for you to think upon some course by our self, and me
your Creature (that have stuck to you, or followed you through all fortunes) to
maintain Rich Lace, and Bravery upon you. And think in time too before this
be worn out, upon some new ways for your supplies --


I cannot, nor will I trouble my brains to think of any, I will rather die
here in Ram alley, or walk down to the Temple, and lay my self down alive, in
the old Synagogue, cross-leg'd among the Monumentall Knights there, till I
turn Marble with them. Think quoth a ^ what should I think on


On your poor Whore Sir (as you have brought her) she is in worse case then
your self; your Clothes are good enough --


I there is the Devil. I would do something for her if I knew how. But what
have I not done that can be done by a forlorn heir


Why though the Dice, and all other Household games, and all the Cheats
belonging unto them have fayld you by your and their discoveries, till none
dare venture so near you as a Man hu^les a Die or Skirrs a Card. Though all
your hidden ways in Hide-parke races are trod out, and all your bowling
booties beaten bare off of the Grounds and Allies; and the sweet Honey-combes
of all your Cockpit cosenages cut off. Though all your Arts of borowing are
crossed out of all Men's Books before you offer at 'em, while your old Debts
stand fairly written, and all your Marts miscarry of putting out for credit,
Venison to Citizens, or early Cherries, Codlings and Apricocks to their Wives
avail you nothing, cannot something yet be found


Nothing, nothing. All Projects are confounded.


Did your Father leave you nothing but wit to live upon for this? And did he
leave you that but for years, and not for Life? and is the term expired


Hold thy peace. I am casting for something to be done by me, that shall be
worth, and cost my life, to shame my Uncle


There Is a plot! Think of your poor whore Sir, how shall she live, if you cast
away your self


I must leave her once thou know.


If you could leave her now, and betake your self handsomely to other Women, I
have thought on a course


What, quickly, what is it?


To set up a Male bawdy house.


Fie upon'^.


You are handsome, lovely, and I think able to do one Man's work, two or three
such Gentlemen more which I know, and can describe to you, with the ways I Will
find to bring in custom shall fill your purses --


And empt our bones. I ever had enough of one Mistress Variety would destroy me.
No Gentlemen can be able to hold it out. They are too weak to make common He
whores


For a little while Sir, till we have got a stock of rich clothes; And then we
will put Drey-men, and Wineporters, Cornish Wrastlers and such like into those
clothes; and make them Country Cavaliers. Have you not seen course snowt-faire
drudges, clapped into bravery, that would do more bodily service in a Brothell
then twenty Ladies Daughters? They are the Game-beares of a Bawdy House, can
play ten single courses for a cleane-bred Gentle-womans one, we will hire
fellows for groates a piece a day, that shall (without the additaments of
Clary, Cawdle or Cock-broth) get us forty pieces a Man before Night, or perhaps
a hundred by next Morning, out of such she* customers, as an Aunt of mine
shall find ou^ for us


O base Villain! No I Will never fall so deep below a Gentleman, as to be Master
of a Baudy-house


Very good decayed Gentlemen have done a much; though I urge this, but for your
pastime sir


No my first plot shall stand, I will do some notorious death-deserving thing
(though these clothes go to th'Hangman for it, what care I) in defiance of him
that was my Uncle, and his Methodicall, Grave, and Orthographicall speaking
friend, Mr. Saveall that calls People Pe-o-ple


O Mr. Saveall how have you honored me, how am I bound to you for this visit!
Sir hearing that my Uncle was come to Town, and you with him, I did presume to
write to you

Send forth your Man.


Go forth --


One Servant is not fit for all Offices, although you keep no more; you
presumed indeed, I can no less then call it a presumption, although it were
but unto me you write; I speak not this in the behalf of any dignity in me;
but that you should overweene that I had ability to wrestle any more with your
overgratefull Uncle in your behalf. Therein was your outrecuidance


The miserablest Man on Earth! in having we^ried out my worthiest friend, on
whom the sum of all my hopes was cast


No, I am not wearied; But still in the same full strength: yet my modesty
disswadeth me from using strength above reason, and my reason prevails with
me not to strive against a Torrent


He is then inexorable, and I must perish. But did you try him for me this last
time


I have both tried, and tempted him to his vexation.


But did you urge that pious act of mine Which he once vowed should never be
forgot, O^ unrewarded by him


Your standing upon merit in that Act
Perplexeth nature in him, and confounds
Both your desert, and his benevolence,
And now since you have urged it, I Will tell you,
Your Act was undeniable, most noble,
And glorious in a Nephew, greater piety
Could not have been expected in a Son:
When from the Swords of Thieves and Murderers,
Your valor rescued him -- But --

I and my Man I Am sure made four of the stowtest purses fly for it, that ever
set our Country of the skore: After they had him down, and their points at his
breast and throat, he crying out for help, when I came on by chance at a time
too when I was in his displeasure, nay he hated me a whole year together
before that, and yet I did it, and more then so --


Fare you well Sir, I thought to have said all this for you, and more then so
too. But --


Nay sweet Mr. Saveall --


Good Mr. Careless, as I can hear I would be heard sometimes.


Ind^ed I cry you mercy, pray sir speak.


I was commending of your act, and do so still.
You did express your self in blood and nature
A perfect Kinsman; and your piety
Drew blessings on you: for whereas before
Your Uncle left you off to Reprobation,
He then receives you a Son, (being his Sisters.)
Adopted you, intended you his heir,
And out of his Estate then presently
Allowed you two hundred pounds per annum,
And gave your Man for what he suffered
In the confl^ct an hundred Marks --

Poor Rogue! and he deserved it, I Will be sworn for a Thieves mark that he
received; a cut of the Cockscombe that cracked his skull, so that ^ee could
never bear his drink since, as he could have done before. For sir, as we came
in, I having put by the thrusts of three of 'em, the fourth man with a full
blow --


Fare you well Sir the second time --


Nay courteous Mr. Saveall.


I came to speak not with you altogether, but unto you for to be heard.


Sir I will hear you with all due respect.


Your Uncle having done so gratefully, and so plentifully for you.
You building still on merit for that service,
Did hold him so fast bound that you presumed
To run upon more extravagancies
In all the out-wayes of debauchery,
Till for the one good deed you did for him
He did you forty, in restoring you
From Surfets, Wants, Wounds and Imprisonments,
Till overborne with charge, and more with anguish,
At your outrageous, unexampled Riots,
He gave you an irrevocable farewell, yet then at your departure. --

Yet then I lived and could have done till now, merely by being his Nephew, and
supposed his heir, had not he married; but his Marriage turned the hearts of
all believing Citizens from me, where before a Tailor could have made me run
through all the credit in the Town, When in a suit Chinquant, and Ala-mode They
could inform themselves, whose heir I was, But to say truth I vexed him into
Wed-lock, for before he valud not a Wife at a batchelors Button


Farewell to you the third time.


Sir, you shall see me die first, and that instantly; That you may tell my
Uncle I Will be no more his trouble, or charge, unless in charity he will send to
bury me


You will not desperately work a violent end upon your self?


No Sir, the D^vills not so great with me; but my heart, I feel it ready to
break. My Uncle is no more my Uncle, nor you my friend, all by my own fau^t,
and what should I do here, but in to my Bed, and out of the World presently.
Wat. Wat

I here Sir!


I have dalyed too long, and tempted him too far I fear.


Lay down my Bed.


Your Wench is come indeed, but I hope you will not to bed before he be gone.


Lay down my bed I say. But first unbutton me.


Lord how his heart beats! pangs of death I fear.


Not so I hope. I will now come to the point Sir, Mr. Careless be comforted.


I am, and well resolved, I thank my better Angel.


Your Unkle's friends with you.


Alas, how can that be?


I thought your spirit had been higher.


It will be Sir anon, I hope.


I have but dallied with you to search your temper.


But you have searched too deep I fear sir.


Ah! --


Your Uncle is friends with you, I say so far as to make a further trial of
your nature, you may be yet his heir; for your Aunt despaireth of any Child by
him, having fruitlesly been married now these two years


Ah! -- But good Sir, can this be?


It is, and I will bring you to him. And see that all be well.


Your noble friendship has revived me sir, O run and fetch my cloak.

Tell Phebe I cannot stay to give her any satisfaction now, I must go see my
Uncle first


Poor Gentleman, how weakly he stands! The sight of his Uncle will recover
him. Come Mr. Careless let us go


Sir what do you think if I should first according to the reformation of my
mind cut off my undecent hair, and change this garish apparel for a civil
well worn Students suit, I can be fitted presently hard by


No, the mind reformed is enough, your habit well becomes you.


Now Wit and't be thy will go with him. And I hope this will be his last hot
fit of the Uncle


Your Masters gone forth it seems.


Called by his fortune, he is so.


Shuns he the sight of me? i will overtake him.


O your patience sweet Mistress Phebe, a little patience.

He Is gone to be happy, and to make you happy. I dare promise you a Satin
Gowen within this sea'night


For let me tell thee Mistress Phebe bright He Is reconciled to his Uncle Knight.

Away Pimpe, Flamsted, I came to be serious with him, to let him know the
miseries I suffer, by the wrongs he has done me, and that I can nor will no
longer bear 'em


Nor him neither will you? Take heed what you say Madam Marion*


No nor him neither, you pandarly Parasite, till ^e make his vows good, and me
an honest Woman


Birlady, a shrewd task, and I fear an impossible work.


Sir, I will claw your ugly Face till thou undertak'st it with him, to make
it easy


Hold, hold, I Will do you all the good I can,


O will you so?


How desperately valiant a Whore grows, when she is so poor that her clothes
fear no tearing

But by what means can you hope to bring this work about?


You know I have a wealthy Kinsman in the City.


O Mr. Saleware, and he has a Wife too that bears it up bravely.


Pimpe impudent, shall I claw your Face into blushes at my injuryes, to be
mocked out of my Maydenhead, when I was upon a good Match in the Country; Then
with a promise of Marriage, to be enticed from my friends into fools Paradise
(that was a new title for the City) and here to be used, and abused from
Lodging to Lodging, by him that now flies me, for the decays he has brought
me to? But my Kinsman has money though I have none, and for money there is Law
to be found, and in a just cause he will not let me sink, he says: for I have
told him all


But not the how many times, the whens, the where is, and the wherewithalls, I
hope have you


Sirrah, I shall show you and your Master too a way to more civility, since I
am thus abused, and slighted


You have schoold me handsomely, and brought me into sense of your injuries:
you have been overwrong'd, but not over-wrought, nor over-worne, you do
excel in Beauty, Strength and Spirit, which makes you in your very anger now
appear so lovely, that I profess my self your Creature. What would a kiss
of this fair Hand now make me do, and of those Lips what not


Away you Creature.


Leave these temptations; do not strike me too deeply in love with you.


Away you Creature.


It Is true I am your Creature, as I am my Masters; And sometimes the serving
Creature, breaks his fast with a bit off the Spit before the same meat is
served up to his Masters table, but is never denied to Diue upon his Masters
leavings, you cannot think what an appetite that frown gives me


You are no saucy Rascal.


Good wit too! My appetit^ needs no Sauce; nor shall you need to make use of
Law, or Friend against my Master, but my self


You!


Be ruled by me, if I do not lay you down, and join with you presently in a
course that shall content you, then -- hang me Lady at your door. --


What do you mean?


In the next room we shall find Pen, Ink and Paper, you shall write him such
a Letter (as I will dictate to you) that shall so nettle him


Nay I did intend to leave him part of my mind in writting before I went. --


O Cosen, I want you. --


A pox of this interupting Cuckold, he hinders all Trading, but his Wives,
zownds I was going with full speed a Tilt, as the learned say, had not this
horne-head come, we had writ lines together should have put down Her^ and
Leander --

Hark you Mistress Phebe, is this your Kinsman that you told me, you had told
all the business to


Yes, sir, I am the Gentleman, and she has told me so much, Sir that I must
tell you, to tell your Master from me, and as I would tell him my self if he
were here personally present, he is a most dishonest Gentleman if he do her
not lawful right by Marrying her; and that right I came to demand, and obtain
of him, or to denounce the Law against him


How happy are you, that you came short to tell him so, else he would ha^ so
beaten you, as never was Citizen beaten, since the great Battle of
Finsbury-Field


Your great words cannot make* me fear his blows (I am not dashed nor basht)
nor cross him out of my Book, for fear of any such payment. I have him there
for four score pound as you know, though you are pleased to forget me, But
Sapientia mea mihi stultitia tua tibi


Cry mercy Mr. Saleware, is it you? I hope Mistress Saleware is well, your most
exquisite, and most courtly wife; the Flower-de-luce of the City


Well wag well, you must not now put me off with my wife, she is well and much
respected; I come to speak of, and for my distressed Kinswoman, her whom your
wicked Master has most wickedly dealt withal. He has deflower'd and deluc'd
her, and led her from her Friends, and out of her Country into Fools Paradise
-- By making her believe he would Marry her, and here he has put her on, and
put her off, with hopes and delays till she is come to both woe and want; And
(which may prove her most affliction, if he be suffered to forsake her) she
is with child by him


Say you so, Mistress Phebe? here is small show of it yet.


Sirrah, I shall show you and your Master too a way to more civility, if I be
thus abused and slighted


By the way Mr. Saleware, how many children have you by your most amiable wife?


Sir, that needs not to fall by the way of our discourse.


But by the way I speak of getting children. Or I pray tell me, did not you
correct one of her children once, for which your wife reprehended you, and bad
you correct your own? And how then shall my Master be sure that this (if it be
one) is his


What an Asinego's this? I shall find a time sir, to talk with your Master.
In the mean time I tell you that my Kinsewoman is a Gentlewoman of as good
blood as himself, and of the best in Herefordshire


Yes, Welsh-blood.


And shall find friends that shall not see her abused by you nor him. There is
Law to be found for money, and money to be found for Friends, and Friends to be
found in the Arches, and so tell your Master, come away Cosen


But one word before you go Sir, is this Gentlewoman, (who was but a Country
Chamber-maide when my Master took her to his mercy) of such boasted blood,
your Cozen by your own, or by your Wives side I pray


Sirrah, like a saucy companion as you are, though you meddle with me that am a
Common-councell-Man; I charge you meddle not with my wife, you have had two or
three jerks at her


I was warned before Sir, in my own understanding: for she is for great persons.


Then know your distance Sir.


Yet give me leave to wait you down Sir, cud shoe did it tell it Kinseman that
it is got with Champkin


You are a Pandarly Rascal, and I Will be a terror both to you, and your Patron.


How can you think so?


Think! I see it apparently upon your Face, and hear it in your sighs, your
broken sleeps to night, when your own groans waked you, declard no less;
But had I had the power of some wifes with their husbands I could have fetched
it out of you waking once (^ thank you) you took me in your arm, but when
you found 'twas I you turned away as in a dream


Sure you dream now, whence can this talk proceed else?


I must not give it over till I know the cause of your melancholy fit, do you
doubt my duty, or my loyalty? perhaps you do, and so make me the cause of your
affliction


May such a thought within me, stick me to the endless torments.


It Is lately entertained, what e're it be; you came heart whole to Town, and
Joviall. Have you been drawn for security into Bonds by any of my friends, for
great sums, and forced to pay 'em


Fie, fie.


Are any great friends of yours in question, attainted, imprisoned, or run away?


Psewh.


Or are you further grieved about your Nephew, Careless? I thought that your
friend Saveall, and my self had made his peace with you; and that you had sent
for him, do you repent that


No, no, sweet heart, he shall be welcome. And pray let me entreat you make
no further inquisition; If (as you suppose) there be a trouble in my thoughts,
I shall soon pass it over


Tell me, or I shall prove the greater trouble. I would those few examples of
women, that could not keep their husbands counsels had been burnt, and the
woman too rather then I should be distrusted thus, and slighted by a Husband --


Nay then you will grieve me indeed.


There has been many examples of discreet women that have not only kept their
husbands counsels, but advise and help 'em in extremities, and delivered 'em
out of dangers


I pray content your self.


Be you content to tell me then what troubles you. And I pray you tell me
speedily, now presently; or (excuse me in my vow,) it is the last request that
ever I will make to you, and the last question I Will ever ask you, and (the
easier to get it from you) I promise you by the continuance of my faith to you
(which by this kiss I seal) Be it a deadly injury to my self, I will forgive
it freely; not be troubled at it


I shall do that now, which few wise men would.
But she is discreet, and has a fortitude
Above the boast of women; should that fail,
And this too weighty knowledge for a wife
Should prove a torment to her, I Am excused
She pulls it on her self, and for Revenge
Should she against her protestation move it,
I am enough above her.

You are resolved it seems to keep your secret Unto your self, much good Sir
may it do you


No, you shall know it, sir, and (if unshaken
Now, in your love to me) the wonder of all wives
You Are bound by a fair pledge, the kiss you gave me,
To be unmoved, and to forgive it though
It be a deadly injury to your self;
It is, and it is a great one; and so great
But that you have sealed my pardon, the hid knowledge
Of it should feed upon my Heart, and Liver,
Till life were banished thence, rather then pull
Your just revenge upon me; yet you frown not!
But before I declare it to your Justice,
Let me renew your mercy.
And on this Altar, which I have profaned
While it breathed sacred incence, now with penitence
Offer religious vows, never to violate
My Faith or Love to you again. One more
Before you hear it: for if then you stand not
Firm to your Mercy, it must be my last.

What do you but violate your Love to me,
Now in your most unjust suspicion?

I Will trespass so no more; yet many husbands
(I wish they had my sorrow, and no less
Purposer to reformation) wrong their wives.

Leave these perambulations; to the point:
You have unlawfully lain with some woman!

It Is said; and now your doom.


Ha, ha, ha. Here Is a busiesse!
Would somebody heard you faith: nay of five hundred
That now might overheare us (I mean not only
Gallants, but grave substantial Gentlemen)
Could be picked out a twelve good men and true,
To find you guilty, I would then condemn you,
But such a Jury must be pannell'd first.

And can you be so mild? then farewell thought.


Thought of your Mistress Sir, And then farewell
My jealousy, for let me tell you Sir,
That I have had an ache upon these brows
Since your last being in Town. And since you have dealt
So faithfully as to tell me it is one,
(There Is no more, is there?)

No upon my vow.


Name me the woman: if it be the same
That I suspect, I Will never suspect more.

As faithfully as to my Confessor;
Saleware my Silke-mans wife.

The same I meant,
You Are a fair dealing husband. On what condition?
Come this is merry talk. Prithee on what condition?
Only to bring good custom to her shop,
And send her husband Venison (flesh for flesh)
I did observe you bought all there last term,
And wished me to her Shop, and Mr. Saveall
With diverse others to bestow our moneys.
Troth she is a handsome one; Prithee on what conditions?

Thou shall know all to purge me of my folly.


Well said.


After a costly, and a tedious Suit
With many an answer no, and no such Woman,
At length she yields for a hundred pieces;
Had 'em, and I enjoyed her once.

That was,
When you last Term sat up all Night, and said you sat up with the three Lady
Gamesters

It is confessed.


Fair dealing still.


But here was the foul dealing, and for which
I hate her now: I having paid so great a fine, and
Taken possession thought after to deal Rent-free.

A Pepper-corne a quarter, if she be Pepperproofe.


But she at my very next approach, which was but yesterday denies me Egresse,
except I make it a new purchase at the same former rate, and so for all times
after


Troth it is unreasonable, a hundred pound a time? How rich would Citizens be,
if their wives were all so paid, and how poor the Court and Country! But
hushed, here comes Mr. Saveall with your Nephew, I take it; A handsome
Gentleman, could he be so debauched


Sir, I have brought you home a Reformado* and do entreat (for what I have
said unto him, and he has fairly answered unto me) that words may not by you
be multiplied


Not a word of unkindnesse, Nephew, you are welcome, give me your hand. George,
thou art welcome


I shall be George of horseback once more I see. In all humility I thank you
Sir


Nay now thou speak, and look too tamely George, I would have thee keep
and use the lively spirit that thou had, but not to let it fly at random,
as it has done George


Sir, I have learnt now by the inconveniences I have met with, in those
extravagant out fl^ghes, the better to contain it within the limits of your
leave, and fair allowance hereafter


Well said, and again welcome George. But (and this you shall give me leave to
say Mr. Saveall) I remit your thanks for any inclination I had toward this
reconcilement till I do you some further kindness; only you had good
advocates, who pleaded friendly for you, Mr. Saveall, and your Aunt there
before she ever saw you whom you may thank


A man must be so tied now.


Pray take notice of her.


I cannot use respect enough Sir.


I like that modesty.


Doubt him in nothing, for he is come home.


Madam as you are my gracious Patroness, and my self so all unworthy, my duty
checks me in my approach to you


You are the more entirely welcome Cosen.


She Kisses like an old man's wife, That is, as a Child late sterv'd at Nurse,
sucks a fresh flowing Breast


You must not Sir be bashful.


'Twill less become me to presume good Madam.


George, here is a Lodging for you in this house, and my Table has a place for
you, send for your man to wait upon you

Have you Wat still?


Yes Sir, an honest true hearted civil fellow he is, as I have managed him, he
can say grace now


The world's well mended. To morrow you shall give me a note of your debts
George, which I Will take order for, if I may presume you have any


Some driblets Sir, My credit has not lately wronged me much.


You speak sententiously, for credit sought With Tradesmen, then their wares
are dearer bought; So Gentlemen are wronged


Then not to wrong our selves, lets in to Dance.


ALL Cheape-side, and Lombard street Madam, could not have furnished you with
a more complete bargain, you will find it in the wearing, and thank me both
for the goodness of the stuff, and of the Manufacture


But now the price Mistress Saleware. I grant your Commodity is good, The Gold
and Silver Laces, and the Frienges are rich, and I hope well wrought. Has your
Man made a note of the particulars, and their prices, at the rate of
ready-money (for I buy so) and not as you would book 'em to an under-ag'd
heir, or a Court-Cavalier to expect payment two or three years hence; and
find it perhaps never. I come with Here is one for the other


I know your Ladyships payment such; And they are prized so Madam to a farthing.


Let me see, broad plate Silver and Gold-lace, 206 Ounces half, and a dram,
at five and ten pence the Ounce. 60 l. 5 s. 3 d. ob. 4. five and ten pence an
Ounce is dear


I protest unto you Madam that parcel of Lace for a Bed as you intend it, was
bespoken, and agreed for at six shillings the Ounce by a very great person: but
because ready money came not to fetch it off, Fortune reserved it here for you,
you could not have been so fitted on the sudden else within London walls; and
I am glad the same fortune was so favorable to me, as by my hands to design
it for your Ladyships use and pleasure. I hope Madam we shall hear of a young
heir a coming shortly, and that will make it a rich and fortunate Bed indeed;
And then Sir Olyv^r would thank me too


What a bold slut it is, well then the rest of the particulars here of Laees,
and Frienges, Loopes, and Buttons, makes the sum of all an hundred pound eight
shillings four pence, halfe-penny. I am no good Arithmetician, but if any be
overcast, and overpaid, you must allow restitution


Yes, good Madam.


Is all put up into this Box?


All Madam.


Give me my Purse. Take you home that while I make payment for it; your
Gold-weights Mistress Salewa^e


Here Madam all in readiness.


You take no Gold but what is weight I presume.


It Is but light pains to weigh it Madam. But let me save your Ladyship that
labor


Nor shall it be your trouble, command your Servant I pray for a glass of your
beer --


Some beer for my Lady presently.


That I may tell you in more privacy, what perhaps you would not have him
hear: for Prentises though they are bound to keep their Masters secrets, are
not all privy to their Mistresses; that is more a Journeymans Office


Your Ladyship is pleased.


Not very well with my self, for I have gone beyond my Commission in this
bargain, and exceeded my Husbands allowance. Here Is one hundred pounds eight
shillings 4 d. ob. in the Bill, and he allows me but the bare hundred pound


The od money is but a small matter Madam.


A great matter in an honest poor Country Ladies purse, may serve her a whole
Christmas at Post and Pare, or Farthing gleeke, when the gay Gamsters wives
of the City may command the hundreds, out of the purses of such poor Ladies
Husbands. But here is the odd money, eight shillings four pence, half penny,
and so all is paid


What means your Ladyship?


Do you not understand me then? I Will tell you that which I thought fit to
conceal from your servant; And from your husband too had he been here,
perhaps he knows not on it. My husband left with you, or lent you the last
Term a hundred pound, which he assigned to me; and now I have it in
Commodity. Had you forgot it, when it was to do you a good turn, when your
absent husband faild you, and you wanted it


A good turn Madam?


Yes, was it not to have the free use of a hundred pound ready money, a whole
quarter of a year, through a dead Vacation, and at last to take it out in
wares? A good turn I think for a Trades-woman; take heed you do not by your
fullennesse make me suspect another kind of good tu^ne, or that you did my
husband any to my injury, nor deny the receipt of his money, lest I take up a
violence that will not become me, no^ you be able to bear. Be therefore well
advised both in what you say, and who hears m^. Somebody comes


Madam your Beer.


I'^e pledge you Mistress Saleware.


I shall presume then Madam -- Drinks.


This was right cast, was it not friend?


Your Ladyship will find it so -- La. Drinks.


And I hope you will find your money so well bestowd Madam, that you will
vouchsafe always to know the Shop


Ever upon the like occasion, Mistress Saleware, so most kindly farewell sweet
Mistress Saleware


The humblest of your servants Madam. Open the Boot for my Lady.


It Is done my Coachman does it.


I would the Devil were in your Coachmans Coat to take his carriage for his
pains


One word more Mistress Saleware, can it be he?


Lay your comands on me good Madam.


Not to your trouble, I perceive a young Gentleman attends for conference with
you. Is not his name Fitzgerrard


No Madam, his name is Bellamie, much depending on the young Lord Lovely.


I thought I had known him, he is a handsome youth. I cannot blame you now
with him: but beware of old Knights that have young Ladies of their own. Once
more adieu sweet Mistress Saleware


Most courteous Madam -- and once more to the Devil. But on my life her chaste
Ladyship is taken with this beard-lesse Bellamie. How she shot eyes at him


Now may your servant obtain a hearing L^^y.


My ears are open Sir.


But you are sad or angry, why seems that brow to threaten a subjection over
him that is your vanquished captive; or has Cupid placed his Bow there bent at
me, whose heart already lodges all his Arrows, never to be restored but by
your pity


Fie, fie upon it! what talk is this? I am vexed, and you would m^^ me.


What has displeased you?


A cross business that has happened in my Shop to day, I being none of the
wisest Chapwoman, have undersold a parcel of the best Commodities my husband
had. And should he know it we should have such a scwable


Husbands should be so served that do impose Those mercenary Offices on their
wives


Talk so, and I will hear you, your amorous notes sound like Play-speeches.


Servile, nay slav^sh Offices, ranking their wives with their prentises.


They pretend only that we should over-looke our servants, when they but set
us there for show to draw in custom: but in making us such overseers they are
overseene themselves; Shopkeepers-wives will be meddling and dealing in their
kind, and as they are able, as well as their husbands (some much better, and
more profitable) but I was overreach'd I confess


For no great matter I hope.


No, the matter was not much (that never fretted me) but the manner has eene
killed a She shopkeeper. I cannot be long-lived, here under a Pent-house, as my
Lord (you know) told me when he said he would shut me out of this servitude,
and that I should change my Coat, though my husband could not, before he were
an Alderman, and be ranked with Ladies


My Lord has still the same regard of you.


So it appears by the Tailor and the Mercer, whom he sent four days since to
measure me out, and suit me to his Honor, and no return of them found, yet
his Land might ha^ been measured all and sold, while a poor suit is dreampt
on, had he borne the mind of some Lord


I doubt not but this paper will clear that jealousy. And while you read
I Will speak that which I dare not utter through, Sighs and Blushes to an
entire attention

I am of Noble-blood my self, freeborn,
And not without good education;
But since I am engaged in this employment,
And made an instrument of others lust,
I find my self a scandal to my Name,
To Honor, and to Virtue, the base blot
Of Pandare sticking on me. But not this*
Alone is my affliction. Here Is my torment,
That while I do true service to my Lord
(Whom I must ever honor) in my Agency
Unto your self (whom I cannot but love)
I find my self a Traitor to his trust,
In my negotiation for my self.
Nor can I find it possible to desist,
Mine own attempts, to you, or forbear to urge
Your constancy to him.

How easy a work
'Twere for one woman to supply 'em both,
And hold her husband play to level Acoile,
A wooden two-leav'd book, a pair of Tables
Would do it.

How wretched is that suppliant, who must make
Suit to obtain that, which he fears to take!

At the bear at the Bridge-foot six a clock, good.

Sir, I find my Lords honorable appointments here, and have heard you all this
while


Now I could wish, and was in hope you had not.


I will not blame you on your Lords behalf;
Because you have enough rebuked your self.
But Sir, if you presume upon the favor
I give your Lord, and therefore to obtain me,
Cause I am his, you undervalue me
To think that I can stoop unto his servant,
Though almost his Companion, you may think
After that degradation by degrees,
I may, in time, descend unto his Footman, I Am no cast
Garment of his Lordships yet.

You have schooled me fairly, I am humbled, Lady --


Dee hear, dee hear sir, Mr. Bellamine,
One word before you go.

What would he buy Mistress? can you take his money?
Sir dee hear?

Pray attend you the the other end of the Shop, If I cannot handle a Customer, why
dos ^your Master trust me? Could a frown fright you? Let a smile then cheer
you


And that is a heavenly one,
As that of Cynthia at Endymion.

Pray leave your Player-like passionate expressions* And if you love me, like
a Man speak to me

As I am a Woman; are you silent? if you doubt the length of my man's Ears at
that distance, you may whisper what so? But that is a right shop-whisper indeed
with Trades-women that are handsome; Is that the most you will give sir? Could
I afford it so, do you think I Would make two words w'ye? yet this before you go
-- Kiss. Now match it for the price I Will give it you for nothing


I shall forget I have a Lord. I must forget him here.


Do so, and if (I say) you love me, speak plainly what you* would have me
do, or what you would do with me (I love to dant these young things that
love before they can love to the purpose, or speak to it* handsomely like a Boy
that would feign be shooting at wild-fowle, before he knows how to discharge
a Birding-piece) I would hear you speak, you have often mu^tered and fribled
some intentions toward me, but I would hear you speak. Come, if you love me
lay by the fear of the Lord that sent you, and tell me roundly now, what you
would have me do


I would entreat you --


Well; what?


That you would be pleased --


With what? or to do what?


To wear this pair of Silk stockins for me*


Is that all your suit, it is granted, with my thanks to you; Have you no more
to say


Yes, I say you are the beautifull'st of Women; and that my Lord in your
enjoyment is the happiest --


Nay think not of your Lord, but ask me, something.


I would but dare not hope for such a favor, ^ou'l never grant i^, my
unworthiness


How can you tell?


You will not wrong my Lord, so as to do it.


Not in his sight perhaps. What is it? come.


It is --


It is then, let it be so. Go to School child.


It is -- That you would, let me -- give you this ring,
And grace it with your Finger.

Will that be a wrong to your Lord?


Yes, to wear any favors, but his own.


Dos he know this?


No, nor I would not that he should (and given by me) for all the Rubies in
Cheapside, where I bought this but now, over the way


Come sir, I Will dally w'ye no longer, I know what you would have with me.


And now you will betray me: I am shamed then and undone.


No, but I have you o'^ the hip. It Is plain you would lie with me: deny it if
you can


O dear, did I say so now?


What need you when I know it, you would lie with me, and you shall. Take
courage man


But, in good earnest, shall I? shall I?


Yes, in good earnest, you will find it no trifling business, when you come to it
once. But sir, upon condition


Any condition Lady.


All purpose on it is lost, and all comes out else.


Name your condition, I Will perform it if it be in the power of my life.


You saw here at your coming a fair Lady.


I took no notice of her.


But she did of you, she is called the Lady Thrivewell.


Sir Oliver Thrivewells Lady?


The same, you have known her it seems.


Seen her before she was married.


I will be brief with you, as you love me she loves you as eagerly, but with
much more boldness, you saw her whisper me, and how loath she was to depart,
when her eye was upon you


I did observe it.


She is my noble friend, and the sweetest Lady, I need not set her out. But
though you think you suffer in your honor, in being an instrument twixt your
Lord and me, with the base blot of Pander sticking on you, (these were your
words) I have engaged my self for her to be your Pandaresse; be so, I shall be
even with you in business if you account it so


What dee mean Lady?


To urge against my self, for that sweet Lady, which no Woman else I think
would do, that loves you so unfainedly as I. But it is my fate, and the
injunction I must lay upon you, to make me yours. That first you give your
self to her Embraces; I Will give you means for your access to her, and your
success with her, which done, and on your faith affirmed to me, it is so, I
will perpetually be yours more freely then your Lords


You urge this but to try my constancy.


For that I Will satisfy you soon, my husband coming we must to night at the
Bear --

My Lord writes so.


And there I will direct you in your progress.

Ally how do? Mr. Bellamy how is it? How dos my noble Lord? You are sad
methinks. Have you overbought any thing here, and so repent your bargain? Or
cannot my wife, and you agree upon it* you must use Mr. Bellamy kindly my sweet
Ally: he is our noblest Lords most special favorite, and must find all fair
dealing here, as well when I am abroad as at home sweet heart


You hear not me complain sir, fare you well.


What an Assinego's this! He might have thanked me for my good words, though I
meant him no good will, I hope thou have overreach'd him indeed


Thomas your hopes are vain, Thomas in seating me here to overreach, or
underreach any body. I am weary of this Mechanic course Thomas; and of this
courser habit, as I have told you diverse and sundry times Thomas, and indeed of
you Thomas that confine me to it, but the bound must obey


Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope sweet Ally; Not of me nor of my
shop I prithee at seasonable times Love. But for thy habit (though this be
decent on a Citizens wife) use thine own fancy, let it be as Courtly, or as
Lady-like as thou please, or my Lords desires


Then I am friends again.


Troth, and I Will call thee friend, and I prithee, let that be our familiar and
common compellation: friend it will sound daintily, especially when thou shall
appear too gallant to be my Wife


Then let it be so friend.


Intruth it shall, and I am very much taken with it. Friend I have found a
Customer to day that will take off my rich parcel of broad Bed-lace, that my
Lord Paylate bespoke, and left on my hands, for lack of money


I have sold it already friend, with other Laces at a good rate.


And all for ready money friend?


Yes friend, a hundred pounds, and somewhat more.


Who would be, or who could live without such a friend, in such a shop? This
money comes so pat for a present occasion, to stop a gap. It has stopped a gap
already friend


I have disposed of the money, the odd hundred pound for apparel, friend, and
other accommodations for my self


Never the sooner for a hasty word I hope friend.


I have done it friend, whereby to appear more Courtly, and Ladilike as you
say, to gain you more custom to your Shop


Uuch friend -- Is it so?


And friend you must not be angry, or think much of it, if you respect your
profit friend


I were no friend but a wretch if I would. No let it go friend, and --
Sapientia mea mihi is my word, I must not grudge at my friend in any thing


Then friend, let your shop be your own care for the rest of this day, I have
some business abroad


Whither sweet friend?


Is that a friendly question?


I am corrected friend, but will you not take a Man to wait upon you?


To watch me, shall I? and give you account of my actions? was that spoke like
a friend


I am again corrected friend,
Do your own pleasure, you will return to supper.

Yet again?


And again, I am corrected friend?


Neither to supper, nor to bed perhaps.


Never the sooner for a hasty word I hope.


But if I chance to stay, you cannot be a faithful friend and ask me where,
or in what company, friendship you know allows all liberty


Sapientia mea mihi. A wity wife, with an imperious will,
Being crossed, finds means to cross her Husband still;
And Tradesmen that so match, must not with Gall
Temper their Wives, but sweetly by wit-all.

Dos not the World come finely on, Wat, ha?
And have not we convenient commings in already, ha!

Better then we know how to have paid, for that is the glory on it.


I need no more insconsing now in Ram-alley, nor the Sanctuary of White-fryers,
the Forts of Fullersrents, and Milford-lane, whose walls are daily battered
with the curses of bawling creditors. My debts are paid; and here is a stock
remaining of Gold, pure Gold hark how sweetly it chincks


Yes, and 'twill ring the changes shortly.


For necessaries Wat, for necessaries it shall change, and Ring all out, and
'twil so long as I have an Uncle, and know to manage him, let money fly

I can no faster spend then he supply.


For necessaries sir, but you must not now count Sack and Tobacco, Whores and
Fiddlers in abundance, necessaries


Why pray?


Because you will have but little then for extraordinaries, That is to say in a
Gentleman for charitable, and pious works and uses


The fellow's spoy'ld.


Not spoy'ld neither: For I would but wave your purpose of flying at all new
Game, and neglect your poor whore, who now begins to be so violent for wrongs,
she can no longer bear, that she intends to pursue you with her complaints
hither to your Unkles House


My Unkles house? my house. Is not the first Mornings draught mine?


With great reason, for you are first dry in the morning.


Is not the question first asked me, what will you have to breakfast? what
will please you for Dinner, and what for Supper? Has not my Uncle let out
moneys, and taken Bonds and Morgages in my name? do not his Tenants crowch to
me, and his servants all call me young Master? And dos not my Uncle take care
to marry me to ten thousand pound, and a thing like a wife


You have got a brave possession here, I must needs say; and I applaud your
fortune most in this, tha^ your young Aunt the noble Lady here, who you see
feared would prove a cruel Stepdame to you, appeare^ to be more friend to you
then your Uncle. It Is a mo^^ gracious Sunshine in her


She shall lose nothing by it. I have thought a way to requite her.


But sir, for Mistress Phebe, will you take no order for the poor soul?


I do not like your zealous solicitation, but her^ an order for her, in answer
of her Malipert Letter yo^ brought me last night. Give it her, and these five
pieces upon condition that she never come, write, or send to me again, till I
send to her


That Is somewhat hard Sir.


Nay look you Wat, you are a little mistaken i^ me. I must give over whoring,
for special causes there unto me moving


O now I find you. And 'twere richly wort^ your patience, if you could win
the Widow by it, for whom you stood in fair election once, until your last
debauchment


I shall stand fairer for her sir, when I leave working but a week or two,
shall I not


Yes, if you leave it quite, but to forsake her whom you have brought low, to
fall to others, were such a thing --


Well sir, it may be I will, it may be I will not, what is that to you? carry you
the Letter, and the Money, and try how that will work with her


I Will do my best, but if she should exclaim, and bring on her Cosen Mr.
Saleware to be clamorous --


Her Cozen's a Cuckold, exclaim and clamorous! give me my money again.


Nay I am gone sir.


The Rogue's in faction with 'em; O noble Mr. Saveall, you have most fairly
kept your minute with me, I have written my Letter, sealed it and all, here to
the Widow


So early? that is well.


I have written no less then six large Epistles this morning, and sent'em now
by my Man to be conveyed into the Country to Lords and Knights, with all the
news spiritual, and temporal, foreign and domestic that could possibly fall
into a private Gentleman's Collection


Is it possible?


With such dexterity, that if I would make a Trade on it, I could undo all the
Newes-mongers in Town that live by it


It is a most commendable practice in a Gentleman, and it will mature your
judgment in the both Commonwealth and State affairs, and in short time
invite you unto the chair of Helm


When I am once married, and settled, you shall see what an ass it is, he
believes me


How am I comforted in my Meditation for you, and how overjoyed will your
Uncle be at the use you make of your retirements


I confess it is (by reason of my unwontednesse to it) some difficulty for me
to write to women; wherefore since you have so nobly undertaken the conveyance
of this, let me beseech you to apologize for the rudenes of my style


To the fair hands of the most acomplish'd in virtue Mistress Anne Crostill,
present, I pray with my service; The outside has no rudeness on it, and (I
doubt it not) she shall find within all sweetness and urbanity


As you may interpret it to her sir.


Sir, what I have already said, and do intend to say unto her from your Uncle,
and my self on your behalf, together with what you have here written, shall
(I doubt it not) prepare so fair a way of proceeding for you; That at your
visit of her you may say, veni, vidi, vici, she is your own


And then -- a ha, Mr. Saveall!


Expect your fortune modestly, and when it comes embrace it with discretion.


Sir, I am edified.


It is well if you be so; I will put my undertaking in action presently, Pray
for my good success


I dare not tell him now I cannot; but I wish well for the Moneys sake; and let
the Vintners pray, and all the decayed Sparks about the Town, whom I will
raise out of ashes into flame again. Let them pray for my good wokes. O my
young Lady aunts grave waiting Woman. If she were not hers, and out of this
house I should take her for a Bawd now. But being hers, and here how much may I
mistake? all flesh is frail


Not to disturb your morning Meditations, my Lady has sent you --


And you have brought me, what sweet Mistress Closet?


A part of her Ladiship^ own breakfast, it is very cordial and comfortable to
the spirits, I assure you, and delectable to the younger sort, and profitable
to the old


One of Robert Greenes works, or the mad Doctor that preaches boyld in it I
think


It Is a composition of mine own Sir, of many excellent decoctions, of most
wholesome restorative, and costly ingredients


That it was sent by her makes it more excellent, whose bounteous care of me, I
must acknowledge exceeds all cost in carving to me, and countenancing me at her
Table, in gracing me in presence of the Ladies that come to visit her; in
giving charge for decency in all things for my Chamber, my fires shining, my
odours burning, my livery served in, my soft and costly bed prepared and spread
with perfumed linen -- here is Ambergreece in this now --


O is it so, do you find that?


But though she is my own Unkles wife, I could ^'ne say it is pity a young man
had her not


What a wag's this?


She is a most sweet Lady.


She is a sweet Lady indeed, I can best speak it that have known her from
the womb hitherto: A sweet infant she was borne, and a sweet babe I swadled
it, and a sweet child I nursed it, I traynd it up a sweet child. It was in
manners a sweet child, at her Book and Sample a sweet child. I never whipped it
but once, and then it was sweet too, and sprawl'd but a little, and whimper'd
but a little it was so sweet a child; And so she grew upwards, and upwards
toward woman, and a sweet youngling she was, and so grew upwards and upwards
toward man, and then a sweet Bride she was, and now a most sweet Lady she
is, (as you say, and I commend you for it) And so she stands at a stay. For now
she grows no more upwards then upon her Wedding day, not upwards as I would
have her upwards, here I mean young Gentlemen, could I but see a sweet babe of
hers once by my Master, I could be then content to sleep with my Ancestors


I had rather see your Gibship hanged up with Polcatts in a Warren, and your
sweet Lady with you, though I confess that were some pity. I hope her
barrenness, or his will preserve her from my curse


I hope still, and she hopes still; and I make him of this broth for every
morning, and many other good strengthening things (I cannot say for the same
purpose) for I shall never see him have an heir by her


Excellent! that is best of all.


Because you then are heir, say you so? Is that your love to your Aunt?


No I protest Nurse, I meant by the broth, the bottom was the best of all.


Then I cry mercy.


Cannot all thy art, and her cost find help for my Uncle, think thou, to
get a child


Help! what dee mean. He might have help and helps enough, were she not too
virtuous


Still thou mistak'st me Nurse.


Away wag away, your Aunt loves you too well to think so of her.


Nurse as I hope to inherit any thing hereafter --


I should but serve you well to tell her your good thought of her.


Nurse, by this good -- piece I think no harm.


Nay, nay.


Take it I say. And tell her if thou will, that I love her so well, that were
she not mine Unkles wife, I would get her an heir my self rather then be his


Kind young Master, now I am heartily sorry that I moved you.


And for my Uncle were I his heir apparent, I rather wish he might live till
all this World were weary of him, and the next afraid to take him

Then I survive him (Tonuge, a pox punish you for lying)

Now I live well, and merrily good Nurse,

Wealth and Estates, bring cares and troubles with them,

Were all young heirs of my contented mind,

Parents and Patrons would be better prayed for.


Good Gentleman.

Nurse Closet.


O my Lady calls.


Present my thanks and best respects unto her.


I should have told you first -- I have forgot. My head is naught,


What member have thou good then?


My Lady desires you -- This talk has put me out -- O this head! My Lady
desires you --


Desires she me Nurse?


Yes sir, she desires you.


Refuse me if I desire not her as much, for all she is my Unkles leavings.


My Lady desires you.


And she shall have me Nurse -- And she were ten Unkles wives, and she ten of
mine Aunts


O this head! nay now you will not hear me, she desires you to go abroad in
the Coach with her


Any whither, to Islington, Newington, Padington, Kensington, or any of the
City out-leaps (I know'em all) for a spirt and back again, tell her I am up
and ready for her, and could have been without her stirrup porredge, though I
thank her for her care. A man can not be too well prepared, or provided for so
sweet a Lady, in so much distress. A very Andromeda, chained to a Rock


What Is this you say? I understand no word of it, I would take your answer
right, though I falter'd in my Ladies message


The Devils in this overruning Tongue of mine, I could find in my heart to
worm him out with my teeth


What must I tell my Lady Sir?


That I am more obliged to her Ladyship then I was to my Mother, she has
brought me a new man into the World, and that my Being and my Life is hers


I hope he is a true convertite, did I send you to hold discourse here, Closet?


Nor did I Madam but I could hear this Gentleman a whole day methinks. He
speaks so acknowledgingly of your Ladyships virtue, and goodness toward him


I am beholding to him, will you go with me Nephew to the Exchange? I am to
buy some toys there for the Country, you may get a fancy by it


Good, I must wear her favors.


Or cannot you forbear your study so long?


To do you service Madam, under whose commands I build my happiness.


Be not at the distance of complement with me good Nephew.


I would not be thought insolent dear Madam.


Come the Coachman grumbles at my stay, and 'twill be Dinnertime presently, so
the Cook will be angry too


You are all tenderness to your servants Madam.


A sweet Gentleman, and bountiful, if my Lady had been blessed with such a
Husband, what a place had I had


Do you know the contents Mr. Saveall of the familiar Epistle you have brought
me here


No Lady, but I guess it a fair expression of the Writers affection to you,
although he desired me to crave your pardon for the rudeness of his style,
it being the first that he has composed of that consequence


Ha, ha, ha, I Will trust you sir, with the full knowledge of it, pray read it
your self


I find she is pleased, and my endeavor prosperous, for the young Gentleman,
I am sorry that I delaid a day in the delivering of it


Pray read it out sir, for I find it so pleasant that I could hear it a whole
day together


In the first place you shall give me leave to wonder at your impudence
(though it be but in your dreams) to have a thought that I ever intended, or
can be drawn by persuasion, force, or the power of witchcraft to marry you --

Bless me! sure if he writ this, the Devil dictated to him.


On sir, that is but his first charge.


Secondly, I am to tell you, that I am warm in mine Uncles favor. And it is
not a piece a time, or five pieces for a piece of pleasure can undo me; and
so I can have change, and escape the captivity of Wedlock

This could no otherwise be done but by the Devil that ought him the shame.


What follows I pray, there is the first and second point past? mark his method.


Thirdly, and lastly, let me advise you, since you are so hot upon Marriage,
though I assure myself you love none but me, (and I thank you for it) that
you frame or dissemble an affection to some one of the City, who is but
comparative to your self in blood and fortune, and so you may make by-use of
me as your friend, and have children like me


GEORGE CARELESS.

Have you ever heard so queint a Love Letter?


Lady, the injury done in it, to your self is unanswerable, but my wrong in
being his Messenger, I will make him answer


Excuse me Sir, he has done me a favor; I pray inform him so with my great
thanks. But for what you conceive a wrong to your self, use your discretion,
you have no more to say to me for him at this present, have you sir


Not for him but against him, I will un say all that I said before intended for
his good


But i will not hear you wrong your former love, and judgment of him so, which
made so deep impression here, that I had locked his love up as a Jewel in my
Breast, and you in striving now to wrest it thence may break the Cabinet; I
rather wish you will be a friendly means to draw his presence hither, that I my
self may mildly question him


Are you serious Lady?


I fear I shall not rest before I see him, but do not tell him that, lest in
this ^ullen humor, he force his absence to afflict me more; I Will hold you
sir no longer, deal for me as you can, I know you have a guess at my desire


I Will do you service in it.

I guess that her desire is to do some act of Revenge upon him. And (so it be
not mortal) it were but Justice in her for so gross a scorn by him cast upon
a well reputed Gentleman. Yet is it observed in her that she has a violent
humor to do, and not to do things oftentimes wilfully against all good
council or persuasion, she has the spirit of contradiction in her, and an
unalterable resolution upon sudden intentions, a most incorrigible will she
has that will not bow nor break. This cross abusive Letter therefore may do
good upon her, however mischievous he might intend it. If she meant well to
him before, it may the faster bring her on, but it amazes me that he should
write so, bearing his Uncle, and my self in hand, that he so fairly loved
her, and besought us to negotiate with her for him, should she forgive it, yet
the wrong to us in his vile manners is unpardonable, and so sir, I come to you


O Mr. Saveall --


What mischief or despite have I e're done you,
That could provoke your desperate spleen against me,
To wound mine honor?

What do you mean good sir?


You have employed me basely, made me your
Carrier of scandal, and scurrility to the hands
Of nobleness and virtue. Could the Fiend
Lust that is in you suffer you to write
No other Sense or Language to a person
Of her fair Name, and Worth, then such as Ruffians
Would send to strumpets? or it being such.
Could not a Porter, or your Pandare there
Serve for the lewd conveyance?
What a welcom's that!

You might safer
Have sent it so, and your own right hand with it;
Then to have drawn my just revenge upon you.

Hold I beseech you, and sir, though I lose the Widow by my error (which was
indeed but a mere accident) let me not be so miserable made as to lose you,
before you hear a short Examination --

Delivered you the Letter which I sent
Yesterday to the Damsel that you wot of?

Yes sir, she read it, kissed it a hundred times,
Then made a bosom Idol on it,
And says you are the noblest Gentleman,
Under a Saint that e're took care for sinner.

Hell take her for a mistaking whore,
She has the widows Letter, and the widow hers,
I found it sir, when you judiciously
Said it was Ruffian-like, and Strumpet* language.

How could you err so strangely?


O slightly, slightly, curse of my heedless brain!
And then too be trapp'd with carelessness.
When I was so religiously resolved,
T'incline to virtue, and a Marriage life,
Thinking with one hand to cast off my follies,
And to take hold of virtue with the other,
For sir, (I will confess my self to you)
The Letter you conveyed was in defiance,
A loose lived wanton, intended to a whore,
That impudently hopes an interest in me.

It was not so directed.


I there was
(The Hell confound it on it) my giddines:
I sealed both Letters e're I superscrib'd 'em,
And so gave each the contrary direction.

'Twas a gross carelessness, and if you lose
A fortune by it, do not blame your friends.

That fortune should favor a whore before
An honest woman. 'Twas the sweetest Letter,
The daintiest winning things -- (the Devils in it)
She must not carry't from the widow so.
Fetch me the Letter again.

Do you think she will part with it sir?


Cannot you beat it out of her sir?


I cannot tell how to do that.


Thus sir -- i will give you demonstration, you malicious Rogue, you that
conspirst with her to betray me, so good a Master I have been to thee, and so
good a friend to her, i will recompense you both


You have undone us both, and will discard us now you are warm in your Unkles
bosom again -- but --


But what you Traitor you?


You put me in good mind, and if I do not somewhat.


I owe you somewhat for your last-nights absence, too pernicious Villain that
kepst thy self out of the way of purpose that I should be drunk, and abuse
my self, and the house here all lay of your absence, There Is somewhat more for
that


It Is all upon account sit.


Who knows an honest Servingman that wants a good Master.


Was it your man's fault Mr. Careless? if I be not revenged etc.


No faith, To speak truth he was as much abused in it, as you in doing a thing
as contrary to his vile conditions, as you did to your noble Name. But I crave
only your pardon, I know not what I do besides. This cross blow of chance
staggers my reason so --


Well sir, since I have found the error, my reason reconciles me to you, and
since it grew out of your equal intent to cast off the evil, as to embrace
the good, I will re-mediate for you to the widow


But yet she will know I have had a whore. Yet then you may say, it is such a
running Disease among young Gentlemen, that not one of a hundred has escaped it,
that have proved stayed men afterward, and very sober husbands; As look you
yonder is one may prove, whom now I have in good sooth a great desire to beat


In your Aunts presence, and your Unkles house; Though I were not his friend;
could you be so outrageous? I muse I see him here though


Cry you mercy sir, are you his friend?


I make my self so, he being dependent to my noblest Lord, whom I am bound to
honor


What Lord I pray, that I may honor him too.


The Lord Lovely.


That loves women above wine, wine above wealth, wealth above friend, and
friends above himself. There Is no scandal in all that sir


It goes so of him indeed, but he loves honor above all those.


Mr. Saveall a word.


Your servant Madam.


In the name of flesh, for what dos his Lordship employ that Angle-worme to my
Aunt? He has had her this hour in private conference, close chamberd up
together, not so much as Matron Nurse in the room with 'em, It Is a fine sleeke
thing, and almost pity to hunt it, but sure I must beat it, as place and time
convenient may serve


Pray^ Mr. Saveall move you my Husband for it, I would not meddle in his money
matters willingly


Five hundred pound for my Lord upon the mentioned security, I will break it to
sir Oliver


Is that the business after so much privacy? ^very pretty, my Aunts a woman
too, and me Uncle may have as forked a fortune, as any of the City, that lend
out money to hedge in Lordships


I am his Lordships servant.


And I your Lordships good Madam. And yours Mr. Saveall.


I am for your way Mr. Bellamy.


And I sir, and't please you.


George Careless, I would speak with you.


May I not wait upon your Gentleman to the Gate Madam?


No good George, though I commend your courtesy, yet would I not you should
neglect your own dignity


Umh -- I am under Government.


The young man, if you have modesty will think you mock him, if not you will make
him become arrogant, know you not whose man he is


No it is apparent, this over-slighting of him proclaims she loves him, whose
follower Madam, and I know Lords followers, Knights fellows


Not all Lords followers to all Knights George.


To as many as their fair Ladies will give way to, that are not faint-hearted.


I understand you not George; something troubles you, you are not right to day.


I am only as I am in your favor Madam.


Come I know what perplexes you* and it is therefore that I desire to talk with
you; I am not angry with you, but let me tell you George, although not openly
I took notice of the pickle you came home in last night, after your Uncle was
in Bed; to whom, mervayling at your absence I excused you, as gone at my
request to visit some Ladies with whom you staid Supper, I told him, when you
were with your Roucers


But did you never go?


Indeed I did, and he was satisfied.


O my sweet Lady Aunt^! I was indeed amongst'em, and deeply merry.


And drunk as deeply!


I will abuse your goodness so no more.


Say and hold George, for your own good.


What Is now become of me, I am under correction.


I would you could have seen your self, and how your disguise became you, as
I was told, I do but friendly tell you of some passages, as they were to me
related, by those whom I have charmed to speak no more on it. Be secure
therefore in your Uncle


O my dear heavenly Aunt!


First, at the door you bounc'd like a Giant at the Gate of an enchanted
Castle, before which could be opened offense was taken by you at your
Sedan-men; for asking money (as appeard afterward) more then you brought from
the Tavern, and leaving their office fouler by a distempered stomach-full,
then you found it. In the strife for these sad causes your Sword being seized
on, you being unable to use it, were found by my servants at Luggs with your
brace of Corpse bearers, in the dirt, and their poor hovill Chair turned on his
ridge in the Kennell


I Will never be drunk again.


I hope you will say so, when you have heard all George; but by the way your
late stock being spent, here are ten pieces toward a supply


O sweet golden Aunt!

Well sir, the striefe appeased, you were taken in. Then hay is there no Sack
in the house? It Is for you in you Chamber is replid, up you are had, where is the
Rogue my man? not seen since Yesterday; Fetch me a wench. Bless us cries old
Sim the Butler, we have none in the house, nor cannot send for any out of doors.
Do -- tell me that? is not my Ladies Woman, my Ladies Chamber-maide, the
Laundry-maide, the wench under the Cook, my Ladies Nurse old Winter plum, nor
my Lady her self within? I know, or will know all the she things in the house


But why me up in your bedroll George?


P^eigh.


You remember none of this!


It is not worth it Madam.


Nor how you scared Chambermaid, whom I sent in love to see care taken for
you, not dreaming of any ill thought in you, do you remember how you told her,
and what you would give her, when your Uncle died for a small present courtesy?
she was feign to saisfie you with a false promise to steal to bed to you
before four men could force, or humor you into it


What an unhallowed Rascal was I!


It Is well you consider it now. And still consider George.

How ill excess of Wine, Roaring and Whoring becomes a Gentleman, and how
well sobriety, courtesy, and noble action, and dangers wait upon the one sort,
and what safety accompanies the other


Wine, Roaring and Whoring, I will lay that saying of yours Madam to my heart;
but Wine is the great wheel that sets the rest a whirling


True George, for had you not first been ^ullied with Wine, you would not have
abused your self to ha tumbled in the dirt with your Litter-mules, nor offered
to seduce my Chamber-maide. Suppose you had overcome her, how could you have
come off but with shame to your self, and the utter ruin of the poor Wench


Still she corrects me for my meddling with base matters and people, she is
not angry she says, though I called for her last night i'my drink, she
gives me money, I will now understand her, and whereunto all her former favors
and her later admonitions are directed, and presently appear a grateful
Nephew


Nay, be not sad upon it George, as I would win you from your faults, I would
have you still be cheerful. If any thought troubles you, you may be free with
me George


O Madam you have made me, and now take me to you.


How mean you?


Freely and wholly, the truest, faithfullst servant, and I think the ablest
that any Lady of your lacks and longings ever bestowd a favor on, though I
say'^ my self. You Will swear't when you have tried me, and't be but hourly for a
month together


Is the man sound troe?


I defy Surgeon, or the Potecary can come against me.


Sound in your senses sir, I mean.


O for blabbing Madam never fear me, now I am resolved to live soberly, and
be only yours. And with such pleasure, with such safety, secrecy, and
fullness, I will so constantly supply you, that you shall not have time to
dream of the defects of your old man


Do you mean your Uncle, and not know whose wrong you unnaturally and
sinfully pursue


No man living Madam can do it for him, more naturally and less sinfully; I
am of the same flesh and blood, and bring his youth to your pleasure, how can
you think old Unkles children are got? or how came up the proverb, She is
one of mine Aunts, do you think? You would have a child by him. All your
Cawdells and Cock-broaths will never do it, An old man's generative spirit runs
all into brain, and that runs after covetousness too, get wealth, not
children. Believe it, much Nephews help belongs to it, and then the children
are not degenerate, I cannot think but many Unkles know it, and give way to
it, because stranger bloods shall not inherit their Lands, and so sweet Aunt if
I live not to inherit his, my son may, in your first born. There will be a
sweet comfort to you


But is all this in earnest?


In earnest? yes, And I pray so take it, and let it be a bargain, and now
presently in the Chamber, I will make you my first payment for the purchase


Fie, fie, you do but say so?


That shall be tried presently. Come sweet Madam, I find you are willing, and
I swear I am resolute, and will be as secret as your own woman, if you will
not go I protest i will carry you


Nay preythee George set me down a little.


Psewgh -- I need none of these whesings I.


But prathee tell me, do thou not all this only to try me, or am I a Rogue
think you, or would thou seriously that thine own natural Uncle, thy
bountiful Patron, nay thy father on the matter, should suffer such a wrong,
and done by us


Hark there again, Madam have I not proved sufficiently and plainly, that I
shall in doing the feate for him do him the greatest right in the world, in
getting him, and you an indubitable heir, and to give him both the comfort,
and the glory of it


Was ever such a Reprobate?


And you can do him no wrong (though you had not a Ladies privilege) to
Cuckold him, for assure your self he Cuckqueanes you, now come Madam


You speak not on your knowledge.


I never was his Pimpe, but what I have heard, I have heard. Now come Madam.


I heard Mr. Saveall protest within these three days that he thought my
Husband the chastest man (of a Gentleman) that he knows


O did he so, Madam, believe it they two have whor'd together, and that
Saveall has pimpt for him oftener then you ever lay with my Uncle


What! since he married me?


What else? Saveall is not only his grave Parasite, but his Pimpe, and has
spent my Uncle more in these civil punctual ways, then I in all my whole
debauches, what did you think he kept him for? O they are a brace of subtle
dry Tweakes, come now Madam


What an inhumane Villain's this*


I Will tell you all now upon our inward acquaintance.


You have told too much already to have any acquaintance with me at all, nor
shall you, unless you presently recant all that you have, or would have said
upon this subject


Madam --


Stand further and reply not, less I call in those that shall sadly silence
you. Have you abused your Uncle, and the next best friend you have in the
World, in hope thereby to abuse me most, that was no enemy of yours till now
you justly have provoked me


I took not a right course.


Was this the best construction you could make of my love to you, or a fit
requital, to make me an incestuous Whore


Yes, yes, a pox my course was right enough, but I undertook her at an ill
season. Her spruce springall left her but now, i will tell her so Madam


Come I perceive you are sorry; and that is a part of satisfaction. Therefore
for once I Will wink at your transgression, especially before others. Here Is one
you see


I do, the Devil blind her.


Madam --


But tempt me so again, and i will undo you.


I know how you will undo me witty Madam, Ah --


Nay be not sad George, discover not your self, and you are safe, for once I
tell you


She Will come about I see.


But will you Cozen go, and do that for me?


Most readily good Madam, I have your full directions.


All Cosen, if you forget not.


I cannot be so negligent in your service Madam, I find by this feigned errand
she dares not trust her trollop there, I love her wit now too


He is both schoold, and coold I hope. Now Closet what is your News?


Of a Citizen Madam that entreats to speak with your Ladyship.


Do you not know his Name, or Trade?


Yes, I had both eene now, but I have such a Head.


If you have lost 'em by the way pray go back and seek 'em, or bring you his
business


I asked his business Madam, and told him he might trust me with it without
a hand to his book, but he said it could not be delivered, but by his own
word of mouth to your Ladyship


What strange matter is it troe? or what Citizen, is not his Name Saleware?


Yes Madam, and he is a (O this head) a --


A Silkeman is he not?


Yes Madam the same.


I hope his impudent Wife has not told him all; if she has, where is his remedy
in this Woman's Lawcase


There Is a Gentleman with him too Madam.


Then we shall have it, It Is his Wife sure, well I am prepared for the
encounter. Bid 'em come up, if they grow violent or too bold with me, i will set
my Nephew George upon 'em. It Is not his Wife, what Creature is it troe with me,
Mr. Saleware


Craving your pardon Madam, a few words in the behalf of this poor Kinsewoman
of mine, touching a Gentleman, who I hear lives in your House, Mr. George
Careless, Madam, by whom she has received much injury


How sir I pray?


Pray Madam read this Letter, weep not, but hold up thy head Cuz, we will not
be dashed, nor basht in a good cause; pray read you Madam


I am now (Lady) in favor with my Uncle, and in fair possibility of a good
Estate, deporting my self (I intend to do) a civil Gentleman. To which end
(induced as well by reason, as by long continued affections) I tender my self
to you in the holy condition of Marriage. If you vouchsafe your consent, (which
is my most earnest request) I shall not only declare my self a good Husband,
but the most happy


GEO. CARELESS.

Wherein appears the injury to your Kinswoman?


In flying from his Word, and Deed Madam. He has borne her in hand these two
years, and use her at his pleasure, detaining her from her choice of many good
fortunes, and at last sends her this to make amends for all, and denies his act
the next day, sending his man to take the Letter from her, pretending 'twas
directed to another. But never the sooner for a hasty word Cosen, we will not
be dashed nor basht, I warrant thee


Here Is the direction. To the Lilly white Hands of Mistress Mariana Gymcrack, is
that your Name Lady


I am the sorrowful one that is known by it Madam.


Never the sooner for a hasty word Cosen.


I conceive the business, and find the error, and my great doubt is over.


Weep not I say.


What would you have me do Mr. Saleware?


You have discretion Madam, and I made choice of your Ladyship to open this
matter unto you, rather then to Sir Oliver himself, whom I would not willingly
exasperate against his Nephew, you may be pleased in a milder way to temper
him, and work a satisfaction for my Kinsewoman; Sir Oliver and your self
Madam, are noble Customers to my Shop, and for your sakes I would not deal
rigourously with your Kinseman, if a gentle end may be made. But, if you cannot
so compound it, the Law lies open, money and friends are to be found, a good
cause shall not be sterv'd, I will not be dashed not basht, Sapientia mea mihi
is my word, and so good Madam you know my mind


It Is pity a Gentlewoman should suffer too much, and I like her so well at
first sight, that I am easily moved to do good for her, is she your
Kinsewoman in blood Mr. Saleware, or your wifes


Mine I assure your Ladyship, though my wife can boast as great and noble
friends I thank fortune, as the wife of any Tradesman that carries a head in
the City, (but that is by the by) yet I came of a better house, and am a
Gentleman borne, none disprais'd


Well Mr. Saleware, leave your Kinsewoman with me a little while, you shall not
be scene in my act, i will try what I can do for her


With all my heart good Madam, and dee hear Marina, This is a noble Lady,
bear your self discreetly in the business, and toward her: you may get a
Husband by it, or at least a composition that may purchase one to sholder you
up. But carry it high and worthy of the house I brag of, or -- Sapientia mea
mihi, stultitia tua tibi, That Is my sentence


Well sir, you need not doubt my high Carriage.


Closet.

Madam.


Take* this Gentlewoman to your Chamber, and I charge you let none see her, or
take notice of her, but your self and me, till I give order


I shall do something for her doubt not Master Saleware.

I shall be bound to your Ladyship, now to my Shop, to which I thank my Wife
she has been a Wildcat these two days, which must be borne with as we are
friends. And from my House all Night, and yet no Greene-goose-faire-time; Nor
though she were so absent must I be so unfriendly as to question her, where,
or with whom she was; a new Article this twixt Man and Wife! But Sapientia mea
mihi, stultitia sua sibi. Thus it must be where Man and Wife are friends, and
will continue so in spite of chance, or high heeld shoes, that will awry
sometimes with any Women. She is not yet come home here. What Lovelies Gammed
with her. His Lordship lay not at home to Night, neither at his Lodging, I
heard that by the way. I cannot think my Lord and she both sat up all Night
to see the Tailors at work, and to hasten the finishing of those Clothes, if
she were with him which I would not be so unfriendly to inquire for the worth
of a Wife. 'Twas right honorably done of him to send her home as gallantly
attended as attired, if she die -- a -- a -- lie with him all Night, which I
will not be such a beast to believe although I kn^w it. I must come on her with
a little wit though, for which I will precogitate


Once more your story, for I am not satisfied with thrice being told it.


Can a Woman take so much delight in hearing of another Woman's pleasure taken?


As it was given by you I can, for I am prepared by it to take pleasure from
you, and shall with greediness expect it till I have it


Then know I pleased her so, that she protested, (and I believe her) her
Husband never pleased her so


Or any other man you should have put her to that, her Husband's but a Bungler.


How know you that?


I do but guess.


Nay she swore deeply, and I believed her there too, no man besides her
husband but my self had e're enjoyed her, but let me tell you Lady, as she
was amply pleased she may thank you


For sending you, I know she did and will.


That was the first respect, but not the greatest:
For in our Act of love, our first and second Act --

Indeed!


In real deed, I can speak now like an emboldened Lover.


Well, but what in your Acts of Love?


I had you still in my imagination, and that enabled me to be more grateful
to her Ladyship, which wrought her thankfulness to you, expressed in a hundred
pieces, sent by me, more then I told before, which are your own she says,
since the other morning she was here with you


That token confirms all. Had I the spirit of Witchcraft, when putting upon
chance for my Revenge, to find Reward! Have you the money


Safe at my Chamber for you.


O you are cunning, less I should break with you you thought to oblige me
by it


I Will rather run and fetch you twice the sum, I concealed it only to give it
you unexpectedly


Sweet Bellamy I am yours, I could be sorry now I have lost so much of thee.
This Kiss, and Name your time --


Would they had done whispering once, that I might enter safe in my manners.


To morrow night.


Shall you be ready so soon think you after your plentiful Lady-feast.


O with all fullness both of Delight and Appetite.


And with all faith and secrecy I am undone else, you know my vows unto my
Lord


And can you think I dare be found your mean, to break'em.


No more my husband comes. Pray Sir return my thanks unto my Lord for his
right noble bounty, and not mine alone, for so my husband in much duty bound
also presents his thanks unto his Lordship


Yes, I beseech you sir.


I am your willing Messenger.


He is my most honored Lord, and has so many ways obliged me both by my wife,
and in mine own particular that --


I take my leave.


Still this is an Assinego. I can never get him to stand a Conference, or a
Complement with me. But Sapientia mea mihi, what was that friend you made me
send thanks for to his Lordship, what new favor has he done us, besides his
council -- These Clothes, the cost was mine you told me, out of the odd
hundred pound you took, what late Honor has he done us


I^t not enough I know Friend? will you ever transgress in your impertinent
inquisitions


I cry you mercy friend, I am corrected justly.


Will you never be governd by my judgment, and receive that only fit for you
to understand, which I deliver to you undemanded? Do not I know the weight of
your floor think you? Or do it you on purpose to infringe friendship, or
break the peace you live in


Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope Friend.


Did you not Covenant with me that I should wear what I pleased, and what my
Lord liked, that I should be as Lady-like as I would, or as my Lord desired;
that I should come, and go at mine own pleasure, or as my Lord required; and
that we should be always friends and call so, not after the silly manner of
Citizen and Wife, but in the high courtly way


All this, and what you please sweet Courtlyfriend I grant as I love
Court-ship, it becomes thee bravely


O dos it so?


And I am highly honored; And shall grow fat by the envy of my repining
Neighbors, that cannot maintain their Wives so like Court-Ladies, some
perhaps (not knowing we are friends) will say she is but Tom Salewares Wife,
and she comes by this Gallantry the Lord knows how, or so. But Sapientia mea
mihi, let the Assinegos prate while others shall admire thee, sitting in thy
Shop more glorious, then the Maidenhead in the Mercers arms, and say there is
the Nonparrell, the Paragon of the City, the Flower-de-luce of Cheapside, the
Shop Court-ladie, or the Courtshop Mistress, have my sweet Courtly friend


How do you talk? As if you meant to instruct'em to abuse me.


Sapientia mea mihi.


To prevent that I will remove out of their walk, and keep shop no more.


Never the less for a hasty word I hope Friend.


Fie, it is uncourtly, and now i will tell you Friend, unaskd, what I have done
for you besides in my late absence, and all under one


Under one! yes, I could tell her under whom if I durst.


What Is that you say Friend? me thinks you mutter.


No Friend, I was guessing what that other thing might be that you have done
for me, all under one. You have taken the House i will warrant, that my Lord
liked so


By my Lords favor and direction I have taken it, And I will furnish it so
Courtly you will admire


Must I then give up Shop, or lie so far remote?


No you must keep your Shop Friend, and lie here if you please.


And not with you but there?


No not with me at all Friend, that were most uncourtly.


But I shall have a Chamber in your house, and next to yours. Then in my Gown
and Slippers Friend at Midnight -- or the first Cock. --


Softly for stumbling Friend, i will do you any honorable offices with my Lord,
as by obtaining suits for you, for which you must look out, and find what you
may fitly beg out of his power, and by courtly favor. But keep your Shop
still Friend, and my Lord will bring and send you such custom, that your
Neighbors shall envy your wealth, and not your Wife; you shall have such
commings in abroad and at home, that you shall be the first head nominated in
the next Sheriff season, but I with my Lord will keep *you from pricking. Be
you a Citizen still Friend, it is enough I am Courtly


Here Is a new Courtly humor, I see no remedy, unless I run my self out of
credit, defy the life of a Citizen, and turn Courtly too


What Is that you say? do you not mutter now Friend?


No, not a syllable Friend, but may not I give up Shop and turn Courtly too
Friend


As you respect my Lord, and your own profit, you must be a Citizen still, and
I am no more a Citizens Wife else, and she must be a Citizens Wife, that
wust do all in all with my Lord Friends. Though my Lord loves the Clothes of
the Court, he loves the diet of the City best Friend, what ever I wear
outwardly he must find me Citizens Wife, which Friend, O he is a sweet Lord


Well it shall be then as the sweet Lord will have it, Sapientia mea mihi.


LAdy, it is true he is a bashful Lover,
Unskilled to court a Widow, has not yet,
The Act methodicall to swear he loves you,
Must and will have you, nor the moving boldness
To stir your blood by putting of you to it,
Or showing you how it is, before the Priest
Declares it lawful. But he has love and sweetness,
Which you will find with full and rich content;
And look (look here) what a long, middle finger he has,
Which with thin Jaws, and Roman Nose,
Are never failing signs of Widows joys.

Your Lordship is disposed to mirth;


It is
My care to put you in a course of mirth,
Nay of felicity.

In marrying of that stripling!


Do not think sl^ghtly of him, tho'he appears
Modest and bashfully, if I have any judgment,
He Is a fit match for you. His outward fortune
For his estate, I will make good to him,
And for his inward virtue never doubt
He Will make that good to you; However still
He holds his much commended Modesty.

My Lord you much commend his modesty,
And bashfulnesse, urging your confidence
Of his strange inward hid abilities
( I hope your Lordships pardon) can you tell,
If he has with that bashful modesty
Got any of his Mothers Maids with child?
Or of his Fathers Tenants Wifes, or Daughters?
I would have some assurance.

Then i will tell you.
These Widows love to hear of manly acts,
And choose their husbands by their backs, and faces.

My Lord you said youl'd tell me.


Yes, but I would not have you cunningly
To sift discoveries from me to his wrong.

I am loath to speak so plainly to you my Lord,
But by the worst that you can speak of him
I may the better like him.

That Is her humor;
Then hark you Widow, to avoid his blushes,
Suppose I tell he has got a bastard.

You may as well suppose i'l^ say 'twas well.


What say you to two or three!


The more the merrier.


He has no less then five old Gentlemen's Young Wives with child this Moon,
but got all in One week


Indeed!


Yes, in good deed, and lusty.


Good deed call you it, to get other Men's Children?


Suppose they have the husbands consents.


I suppose they are wittalls then.


No they are wisealls, and it is a thing in much request among landed men, when
old and wanting issue of their own, to keep out riotous Kindred from
inheritance, who else would turn the Land out of the Name


An excellent policy!


You know the Lady Thrivewell.


And her old husband, and his riotous Kinseman too.


You will hear more hereafter, but now to him again, for whom I am spokesman.


In a strange way me thinks.


He is sent for far and near on those occasions, he is of so sweet a
Composure, and such sure taking metal, that he employes my care to have him
well bestowd before he begins to wast


Is It possible he has done so much, and says so little?


The deepest waters are most silent,

But he can speak, and well to Bellamy.


My Lord.


I have made your love known to this Lady.


My love my Lord?


And have begun your suit; follow't your self.


My suit my Lord to her? I never moved your Lordship to it, Though I presume she
may be a happy fortune to one of my condition; a poor and younger brother;
only made rich and happy in your Lordships service, and overflowing favors


Which i will take off of you if you slight my care in seeking your preferment to
this Lady, of beauty equal with her fair estate, in both which she is great,
and her achievement will be the Crown, and the continuance of all my favors
to you, you are lost* if you pursue it not, I would thy old Uncle Bellamy saw
thy Bashfulnesse


Your Lordship seems now to woo for me, not him, however I am bound in thanks
to your nobleness, in your fair proportion, I hope, I shall not be so poor
to require an advocate, when I shall yield to have a husband. But your mirth
becomes your honor, and the young gentleman's reservednes him, Ha, ha, ha


How mean you Mistress Crostill?


I do commend your mirth my Lord, for the lusty strain you spoke him in, that
he had yet five children in one week, wherein I may presume you thought you
had moved to my liking, ha, ha, ha --


I am glad I have made you merry, But you will wish if you reject him --


If I reject one that tenders not himself! yet I commend his caution.


As how I pray?


As thinking I am one of your cast pieces
(Knowing how well your Lordship loves the game)
And now would put me on him,
But you misprise me sinfully sweet Youth
In such a thought, how e're you should not scorn
To ride in your Lords cast boots, though you be Gentleman of's house.

Come now he shall have none of you.


I Will hear him say he will not first, by your Lordships leave.


Spirit of contradiction!


Stay sir, would you be content to have me?


You heard my Lord say I should not.


But say he say again you shall, speak, will you have me?


Say no ( I find her now) that is the way to win her.


Without instructions good my Lord.


Lady I find so much your scorn already,
That to be wedded to it, I should despair
(My much unworthiness considered) to convert it
Ever to love, and it is your love, before
Your Person or Estate, that my affection
Ought to direct me to.
In answer therefore, to your will, you have me,
I must say no, till I perceive some sign
Of love in you toward me.

I now he speaks!
Some signs of love in me? How would you have it?
Must I declare it to you, before you seek it?

No; I would seek it zealously, but my Lord
Is off on it now, and I may lose his favor.

Is your love limited by his favor then?


Not limited: but (as it is as yet,
But in its infancy) a little checked,
Though it still grows, and may extend beyond
All limitation to so fair an object
As is your self: But still my own demerit
Curbs my ambition more then love emboldens.

He speaks within me now.


Stay, let us retire. Here is the Lord Lovely.


Be he a Lord of Lords i will not retire a foot.


What servants Mistress Crostill do you keep.
To let intruders in?
O Mr. Saveall!

The humblest of your Lordships servants.


What Gentlemen is that you bring with you?


It is the Newphew of the good Knight Sir Oliver Thrivewell, of which Sir
Oliver, I have procured unto your Lordship the sum which you desired by your
servant Mr. Bellamy


For that I thank him and you, but I could wish you had not brought that
Nephew hither now


Certes my Lord I am sorry.


My reason is, I have entered Bellamy a suitor to the Widow.


He also comes a suitor.


And is in deep discourse with her already, I Will see fair play.


But you shall hear me Widow, and that to the point and purpose.


Lady at my request, do this Gentleman (who made the first approach) the
favor to be, heard, and answered first


As his approach was first my Lord, she has heard him first already, and my
request is to be heard now, and then let her answer both him, or me, or
neither, what care I


Your Name is Careless I take it.


I came to talk with this Gentlewoman.


Pray my Lord forbear him, and let him speak, what do you say sir?


I say I love you, do resolve to marry you, and then to use you as I list.


I say I love you, do resolve to marry you, and then to use you as I list. --
To Bell. --


This to me Lady? i will take you at your word.


Stay, I do but tell you what he says.


Take her at her word again sir, and I shall take you by the luggs. I say
again you shall have none but me


I say again, you shall have none but me, -- To Bell.


What, do you fool me, or him, your self, or all?


Pray sir how old are you?


Are you good at that, pray sir, how old are you? -- To Bell.


You press beyond your privilege, which is only to speak to the Gentlewoman.


My Lord I am a Gentleman.


You may tell her so.


Let we beseech your Lordship.


How can you use a Gentleman that loves you
Dearer then Life, and only bends his study
By all means to deserve you, one that (can not?)
Will not, while there are ways to die, live out of
Your favor, with so much despightfull scorn,
That when he speaks his soul to you through his lips,
You make his Language yours, and give't a Boy?

What Gentleman's that you speak of?


The man that speaks it I am he.


All this sir in effect, and more of my affection, can I speak to you.


Uns, but you shall not, you mistake the person to whom you are, or ought to
direct your affection, you mistake strangely


No more then once a Lover, or at least,
A bold pretender, having in civil language
Expressed in writing his affection
To a chaste Mistress sea^'d, and directed it,
And on the contrary, courted his virtuous friend in brothell language;
To a lewd strumpet. Have I hit you sir?

What can I say now! Slife if that anger you after the error found, and
confessed, i will write worse to you, and in earnest


Mr. Bellamy some other time I shall be glad to see you.


She means that to me now, but i will take no notice; i will find as good a
Widow in a Tavern Chimney, O she is a dainty Widow


He looks with scorn at me, I must not lose him, yet dare not stay, for
fear I tell him so
I humbly crave your pardon good my Lord,
For my ill manners, and abrupt departure;
The cause is urgent, and I beseech your mercy,
Question it not.

Let your will guide you.


Mr. Saveall I thank you for my Suitor.


Nay but Lady.


Yes you shall controwle me in my own House.


Yes, yes, I mean so too, but you shall woo me hard first.


It Is a mad Widow, which of these two now think you has the Better on it?


I think he shall in the end have the best my Lord, that can slight her most.


It Is my opinion too, and hear me --


Sir, I have seen you but twice, and it has been at places where I cannot
allow of your resorts, first at my Aunts, and now here at my Widows


Your Widow sir! I thought she had been the Widow of one deceased.


Thou art a witty, pretty Child. But do you here use your wit, out of the
smell-reach of your Lords perfumed Gloves, and I shall take you by the Nose


Forbear sir, I have a Handkercher.


And let me find you there no more, nor here I charge you.


I hear your charge sir, but you must leave it to my discretion to obey it, or
not


Trust to your discretion!


And so commend me to my Lady Thrivewel Come Bellamy away, what is your
discourse


All fair and friendly my Lord.


Very good.


So should it be with Rivalls, fare you well Mr. Careless.


Your Lordships -- with a whew.


Will you walk homewards?


Excuse me sir I pray.


It will not be convenient to return this day unto the Widow.


Fear it not sir, I like her not so well now.


Do your pleasure.


Have you cross tricks Mistress Crostill? well I will go drink your Crotchets
out of my Pate, then home, and do that which mine Aunt and I must only know.
This is her Night of Grace, if she keep touch with me


IN truth your story is pitiful, but your own folly has brought your scourge
upon you


'Twas through the blindness of my love, and my credulity Madam, wrought by
his strong Temptations


Well, for this once i will strain a point of honor for you, chiefly indeed in
answer of his rude unnatural presumption in attempting me. That a Villain
can still be so barbarously lustful! If in this way I fit him not, and cause
him to desist his beastly purpose, I will discover all to his undoing. Closet
you know my mind, and fu^l directions for the conveyance of our design


Yes Madam, doubt not. Though I have but a naughty head at most, other matters,
I dare not trust it for a sure one at such conveyances


I presume to further the matter, he will come home Drunk by his not coming to
Supper


Then he may forget what he so much expected, or sleep away his expectation.


No, he will then be the more vehement till his desire be over.


You know his humor best it seems, away, away, my husband comes.


Well Wat, for this discovery i will make thy reward worth ten such masters
services


Sweet heart I have a suit to you -- But first what Woman's that with Nurse?


A Kinswoman of hers whom she would prefer to me, but I have answered her,
I will not charge your purse with more attendants; only I have given her leave
to entertain, and lodge her this night


That Is my good Girl.


Now what is your suite sir, (as you are pleased to call it) which I would have
to be your free command


It Is for my absence from thee, to accompany Mr. Saveall, to bring a dear
friend on his way to Gravesend to night, who is suddenly to depart the Land


These sudden departures of friends out of the Land, are so frequent, and that
I may believe you intend really, and no fained excuse; now will I think as
long as you have good and substantial Made-worke at home, that you will seek
abroad for any more slight sale-ware


No more o'that Sweet heart, farewell, expect me early in the morning.


I am glad of his absence to night, lest there should happen some cumbustion in
the house by his un^uly Nephew, in case he should discover my deceit in
beguiling him with his own wench instead of me, I do even tremble to think
upon the unnatural Villain, that would offer so to wrong his Uncle. I thought
I had schooled him sufficiently, and beaten him off at his first attempt, and
he to assail me again with more forcible temptations urging me to a promise


The young Gentleman is come in Madam, and as you foresaw very high flowne, but
not so drunk as to forget your promise! He Is going to bed in expectation of
your approach


And have you put his Damsel into her nightattire?


Most Lady-like I assure you Madam.


And let her be sure to steal from him before Day.


Yes, with all silence Madam, she has promised.


May Ladies that shall hear this story told,
Judge mildly of my act since he is so bold.

NAy but look you Mr. Bellamy, it is not I protest that I am jealous, I make
this inquiry for my wife. I jealous? I an Asinego then, I am as confident of my
wife, as that she is in this house, how ere you deny her to me


Why Lady, you are not jealous now? If you were not, you would believe me she
is not here


Without equivocation, Mr. Bellamy, she is not here -- indeed, under your
foot, but she is here in the house, and under some body for ought any body
knows, but my self, that do confide in her as I say, and will know no such
matter; And so my Lords will be done with her, I hope I shall see her well to
morrow, and at her own house


Can such language proceed out of any but a jealous mouth?


What an Assinego's this! I say again, I do confide in her, nor will I be
dashed, or basht at what any man says of, or against her; And therefore me
thinks it is very strange that you should deny her to me, that comes not to
molest her


There you are again. But since no denial will serve your turn, indeed she
is here in this house, and in bed by this time


Away, away, you mock in faith, you are a wag she is no more here then I am, if
sh^e were here can I think you would tell


How came you to think, or dream she was in this house at all?


I neither thought it, or dreamt it. I but sir, a waterman brought me a Letter
in have from one Mr. Anonimus, intimating that my Ally was with a private
friend at this house, and to lie here all night (a very likely matter) what
private friend has she but my Lord, and that in a right honorable way, I
confide in 'em both for that; but at this house is such a thing my Lord having
diverse Lodgings, and she a house of her own at his dispose and command, that
is such a thing to be thought or dreamt on


Why came you to inquire then of such a thing?


Why sir, this Anonimus writ that I should come hastily hither, and ask to
speak with you Mr. Bellamy, and I should know further; hither I came, here I
find you* you deny she is here, and what do I inquire any further


You hear me say again she is here.


Go you are a wag again, she here? is my Lord here? or any private friend?
alas, alas you are too young Mr. Bellamy, and may as well persuade me I am
jealous


Well sir, to put you out of all jealousy and doubt (if you be in any) I was
the Anonimus that sent you the Letter to draw you hither and declare my self
your friend, which shall instantly be manifest to you, if now you have a mind
to lie with your own wife before any other man


Then she is here indeed belike.


Pray come with me into the next Chamber.


This is some waggery plotted by my wife, I smell it.


But you must be sure to say when she discovers you, that you came of your
own accord, unsent for, as inspired or possessed by some Dream or Vision, to
find her here


Well, if this be not my wifes waggery in a maine proof of her chastity, I am
not here. I will do so sir


So then, obscure your self a while, while I approach her.


Who Is there?


It Is I, your servant Lady.


Sweet Bellamy why come you not to Bed?


Good.


Dos the love that was so hot, and the desire that was so fervent, begin to
cool in you


Good again, as if he an Assinego had ever made love to her fine waggery!


Has my mere consent to satisfy you, cloyed you?


Consent to my Lords man, a likely matter!


Or did you court me to a promise only to try my fidelity to your Lord, and
then betray me


Dear Lady think not so, but that I am struck into stone with wonder, and
amazement at the most unexpected accident that ever crossed a Lover


Dainty waggery this, what little mad Rogues are these to plot this to make me
jealous


Pray, are you serious? what is the accident?


I will not be so crossed, but kill him rather. To enjoy such a Mistress, who
would not kill a horned beast? yet blood is such a horror --


Very pretty.


Will you not tell me?


Speak lower gentle Lady.


Why prithee, who can hear us?


I know not by what Magic your jealous husband has made discovery of our being
here, he wrought sure with the Devil


I am undone then. He will tell my Lord.


I shall undo my self then Friend. No, Sapientia mea mihi. Be not dashed nor
basht for that good Friend, if there were any such matter: but this is waggery,
fine waggery plotted betwixt you* to tempt my jealousy, but never the sooner
for a hasty word I warrant you. Mr. Bellamy that my Wife is here I thank you;
But how I came to know it you shall never know from me; you sent not for me, I
am sure you were not the Anonimus. Indeed it should have been Anonima
Friend-wife: for it was thy act I dare swear; However you do not hear me
say I was sent, or writ for at all, more then by a Dream or Vision: But here I
am and mean to remain to night; I hope the house can afford you another Bed
in it Mr. Bellamy, and you to leave me to my own Friend-wife, I like the
lodging most curiously sweet Friend, and I prithee, lets try heartily what
luck we may have in a strange place, I would so feign have a little one like
thee


I Will leave you to your wishes, a good night to you.


Pray sir a word first, husband be farther.


Faces about Tom Saleware, and march forwards.


You told me sir, of a hundred pound that your sweet Lady Thrivewell sent me.


It Is true I have it for you.


But she has since countermanded you to keep it, has she, and to mock my
expectation of that, and you* why have you foold me thus


I rather should suspect your craft in this prevention: but love forbids me,
and I must conclude, it is witchcraft in your husband


Come let us kiss friends, and (sweet) to morrow night I will prevent his
Witchcraft, in the full enjoyment of our free pleasures: be you true to me


May all that is Man in me forsake me else.


Another kiss and then good night.


Are you ^still whispering? no matter, let 'em whiswer.


Good night.


Now may the spirits of all injured women, be added to mine own, for my
revenge, which I this night will dream of slighted and mocked, he and his
like shall know

That when a yiedling woman is so crossed,
All thoughts but of revenge with her are lost.

O he is gone -- Ally, Friend I would say, And now I prithee tell me how, or
why thou came hither


Will you pardon me?


Yes faith, I were no friend else.


'Twas but to try if I could make thee jealous.


In waggery! did not I say so! when do my prophecies fail?


But what brought you hither think you?


A Letter from one Anonimus, but i will eat Spiders, and break if you sent it
not


Give me the Letter.


Where is it? facks I have lost it.


'Twas I indeed that sent it.


Did not I say so too? and that it should have been Anonima, Sapientia mea mihi,
when do my prophecies fail? i will to bed instantly while the prophetic spirit
is in me, and get a small Prophet or a Southsayer


No, i will have no bedfellow to night.


Nere the less for a hasty word, I hope Friend.


I am at a word for that.


I Will lie upon thy feet then.


Well, you may draw the Curtains, and sleep by me.


Sapientia mea mihi, stultitia tua tibi.
Puts in the bed,

MAdam, Madam, sweet Madam, 'twill not be day these three hours, stay but
three minuits longer, but a touch more, she is whipped into her Chamber. Could I
but find the Door -- I know my Unkle's from home -- O she returns with
light: that is well


What aile you! Are you mad?


Would not any man be mad for losing such a Bedfellow? sweet Madam, let us
retire without any noise


What an insatiate beast are you? would you undo for ever both me and your
self


Not with one do more I warrant you, come away Madam, Madam, somebody knocks
mainly at the gate; and I believe it is my Master returned before his time


I cannot think it is he.


It Is the Rogue my man I warrant drunk, and has forgot I turned him away, but
he shall spoil no sport. Come away Madam


Closet, go your ways down, and hark before you --


-- I will Madam --


So now come Madam, I commend you in the charge you have given your watch-woman.


What charge do you guess?


Why to tell my Uncle (if he be come) that he must not come near you, that
you have had no rest to Night till just now you are fallen asleep, and so
forth


Go you are a wicked fellow; I am sorry for any the least favor I have done
thee, and do thou dare to attempt me once more, i will have thee turned headlong
out of my doors


I have got her with child to night, with a spark of mine own spirit, and
longs already to do me mischief. The boy will be like me, therefore it is
pity to knocked of the head: But come Madam the other crash and good night, must I
drag you to it


Touch me but with a finger, and I Will raise the House.


You dare not sure, and now take heed you vex me not, have you not been my
whore


You dare not say so, for spoiling your fortune.


Faith but I dare, and if you will not obey me in a course of further pleasure
to night, fetch me a hundred pieces to take a course abroad withal, do ye
look? I Will make you fetch me hundred after hundred Huswife, when I want it, or
shall be pleased to call for it. All comes out else, the gates of your fame
flies open Lady, I will proclaim our Act


Dare you forfit your own Reputation so?


I shall gain Reputation by it in the company I keep abroad, and if the
Cuckold my Uncle come to the knowledge of it at home, I shall possess him that
you lustfully tempted me to it


Can thou be so villanously impudent todestroy thine own fortune to ruin me?


You may conceal all then, and so will I, and mend my fortune by yours, I will
live bravely upon your fortune, and the heir which I have got to Night shall
inherit it, my Unkles estate. And therefore indeed I would have all conceald;
for my child's good, or rather for mine own: for it shall go hard if I put him
not into a course in his minority to consume the estate upon me before he come
to age


I am undone.


And O that ever I did it!


Thou Villain, have undone me.


Come i will do you again, and then all is whole again;
You Are both undone, O you prodigious monsters
That have betwixt you made me monster too!
What Is to be done, but that I kill you both,
Then fall upon my sword.

Sir, you resume the temper of humanity,
And let the Law distinguish you from them,
You neither are to be their Executioner,
Nor to fall with them.

Life to me is torment.


O the Devil, what a case am I in now!


Pray hear me sir?


Can more be said to aggravate thy shame,
Or my affliction, then I have heard already?

Let me entreat you hear her.


What shame did you, or what affliction I
Suffer, when you discoverd unto me
Your bargain of a hundred pound in Saleware,
You understand me. How was life a torment
To me then think you?

Did you not vow forgements then? and thus,
You freely would forgive my act? and thus
Now to revenge it on me to my ruin,
And your own endless infamy? O it is horrid.

It Is no revenge at all, only a show
To startle you, or try your manly temper,
And so near to be even with ye as to let you know,
what some wife might perhaps have done being so moved,
It was my plot indeed to strain you hither to this false
fire discovery, for which i will give you reasons.

O gross dissimulation.


Mr. Saveall, you have done many fair offices for his Nephew, do this for me,
entreat him to a Conference a few minutes in my Chamber; if I clear not my
self in his and your opinion, and that by witnesses, let me be found the shame
of all my Sex


Sir, my counsels have been prevalent with your judgment, let me persuade you.


But I will have that friend thrust out of door first.


I would not that you should, nor give a look, or word to him till you have
heard me; Then exercise your Justice


Sir be induced to it.


You have prevayl'd.


Go to your Bed again George, and sleep, be not afraid of Bug-beares.


Hows this? She Is come about again, and has patched all up already. I hope
she will work mine Uncle to reward me for my Night-worke, and bring him in time
to hold my sti^rop while his George mounts her; She Is a delicate well-going
beast! I know but one to match her in a course, just the same pace and speed
as if I had only had the breaking, and managing of her my self, but the mark
goes out of Phebes mouth now; and i will play my Aunt against all the Town. But
how she thought to fright me with villain and impudent. And now go to bed
George, ha, ha, ha, I find her drift. No wit like women's at a sudden shift


BEllamy thou art welcome, and for thy Nephew I must ever thank thee, he is my
best companion


O my good Lord without boast be it spoken, I have ever been right and
straight to your honor, and never did you an ill office in Man, Woman, or
Child, what I have said of 'em they have proved at first, or I have wrought 'em
to at last. But what do I speak on it, I have ever been for your Lordship,
all things I have sworn for you, I have fought for you, I have brok'd for you;
I have pimpt for you, but what do I speak on it


You need not Bellamy: for I know all.


Oh the Gentlemen's Wives, and Farmers Daughters that I have presented to you in
your Summer Progresses, and winter Journeys about the Countries. But what do I
speak on it --


Because thou love to champ upon the bit to please thy old coltish tooth
still, thou love the memory of the former sweets which now thou can not
relish


And here in the City, I have pledged more of your several Mistresses, then in
my conscience there be honest Women in it. But what do I speak on it


I never had so many man.


Or if you had, what do I speak on it? and in my conscience again, I have
drunk more to your Lordships health in my days, then any Wine-cellar in the
City at this day, contains of Spanish French, and Rhenish; but what do I
speak of that either


True Bellamy, fall then upon ^ome other subject.


Yes, my good Lord, and I pray your Lordship tell me, dos not my Nephew drink
and wench pretty handsomely? I would feign have him take after me, and not his
drunken father


How well he shifts his subject, wicked old fellow!


Dos he not begin to fall to yet?


Not he.


Not a bit nor a soope? dos he do nothing by example? or has your Lordship
left it? or dos he carry it like a Gentleman


Discreetly and Virgin-like.


Pretty commendation for a young Courtier.


I would for my deserved love to him have put him upon a fair young Widow of a
great fortune, but could not make him look upon her like a suitor


Just such a bashful puppy was my brother, his Father; I wonder how my Mother
came by him; My Father was right, and she was right, and I have been right,
but what do I speak on it


True Bellamy, speak of somewhat else.


The Boy will nere grow up to me, I thought to have left him somewhat, I must
discard him


If you do, he is in me provided for.


What can your Lordship love him for?


Come i will tell thee, and be comforted. He has something of thee in him. He
will pimpe most conveniently


That Is something indeed.


And for his modesty which is a rare benefit of nature in him, I dare trust him
with a Mistrisse, as I would an Eunuch


Benefit! A defect I fear, yet I may hope in time some Mistress of your
Lordships may tempt, and bring him forwards


No I am confident -- Now your news.


Good Bellamy walk in the Gallery a while.

Some Mistress is coming to him, but what do I speak on it?


Go bid her come in.
What brings her so unseasonably?
Stay you at distance yet a while Friend, till I call you.


Faces about Tom Saleware.


How now! How is it with my love? Ha! How comes a trouble on this Face, where
my delights are ever wont to Revell


O my Lord --


Say who has injured thee? Has thy husband taken up the uncivil boldness to
abuse thee? or be it any other man, it shall be death, or an undoing to him


My Lord, I am wronged, but would be loath to engage your noble person in my
quarrel, some servant of yours may do it


Of what condition is thy wrong? tell me; and who of my Servants thou would
have to right thee


I would have Bellamy, how think you? is he faithful to you?


How can thou question it? Has he not ever been so?


Your Lordship has well trusted him I know.


I do not know the man, I trust, or love so well.


But would your Lordship part with any Jewel, or choice thing you love, and
have intended only for your own particular use, to him, or let him be your own
partner in it


Troth I think I should; only thy self excepted, but what is thy wrong I
prithee, or wherein should Bellamy right thee


Bellamy has wronged me to think me so unworthy as to be tempted to his lust;
Bellamy has wronged your honor in that ambitious attempt


Thou amazest me.


And Bellamy must right me, and your honor; or you must cast off him or me.


Give me at least some circumstance to make this probable.


Must not* I be believed? you shall have instance then to make it truth, Friend
Thomas

Pray verify unto my Lord the discovery you made last night of me, and Mr.
Bellamy


'Twas thus my Lord an't like your Lordship, my wife was forth at evening ant
like your Lordship, as she may have often been ant like your Lordship, and
may be as often again ant like your Lordship


Well pray thee on.


Forth she was ant like your Lordship, I staid supper, and almost bed time for
her ant like your Lordship; And had even given her over for all night ant like
your Lordship, as I may of any night ant like your Lordship


O^ I pray thee.


Yes ant like your Lordship upon some private notice given to me an't like your
Lordship, that she was at a private lodging ant like your Lordship, with a
private friend ant like your Lordship, over I went, and found her abed ant like
your Lordship, and Mr. Bellamy even ready to go to bed to her ant like your
Lordship


Is this true?


As true as your Lordship lives ant like your Lordship.


How could you be betrayed so?


The Villain fetched me forth, and lodged me there as by your appointment,
and for your own pleasure; but when 'twas late, and that your Lordship came
not, thinking he had an advantageous opportunity, he soon discovers his love
to me, and his treachery to your Lordship; I being in a strait only to prevent
him) made him a false promise being secure in my husband; and what had followed
your Lordship understands


I Will nere trust man can blush and weep again.


Insooth ant like your Lordship I thought all had been but waggery ant like
your Lordship, to tempt me unto jealousy, and my wife knowing well enough that
I was by, bade Sweet Bellamy come to Bed, O Wag


What messenger brought you the notice Mr. Saleware?


A waterman my Lord, and like your Lordship, here is the letter, and like your
Lordship


You told me you had lost it, when I asked ^ort to burn it.


I thought I had Friend, but I found it now, and given it my Lord before I was
aware Friend


Hell take that Letter.


Now abotts on it for me, if thou be angry Friend.


You had better ha swallowed it full of Ratsbane.


Nere the sooner for a hasty word I hope Friend.


Mr. Saleware, if you will avoid a new addition of horns, come with this
bearer over into Montagues close, where you shall find your Wife with a
private Friend, at a private lodging; Have thither, and ask for one Bellamy

What Ridles this? This is Bellamies own hand, I know it, why should he send
to prevent himself? or how could she write his Character? This Woman is not
right


Do you note my art my Lord, to write as in a Man's Name, when I wrought it my
self


And did not I tell you Friend, it should have been Anonima? Sapientia mea mihi.


Within there call Bellamy.


He Is not within my Lord, and has not been to night.


His absence is another circumstance to a probability my Lord.

But he was seen this morning to go in at Sir Anthony Thrivewels.


Go let my Coach be ready presently.


He should receive 500 l. there for me, I trust he will not ^urnish himself
with it for a flight

My Lord I gave you an inkling of a familiarity betwixt him and the Lady
Thrivewell, he has since declared their act of lust to me, and urged it for an
instance to my yiedling


Can you affirm this?


Yes, to his face and hers.


O Mr. Saveall! welcome.


My Lord your servant Bellamy is receaving your money at Sir Anthony
Thrivewells


I thank you.


But my Lord, there is fallen an unhappy accident between Sir Anthony, his
Lady and his Nephew, in which your servant Bellamy also is concerned; And your
Lordship is much, and most humbly besought by the Lady to hear, and examine
the difference


I was preparing thither. Oh Mr. Bellamy, you have not eavesdropt, have you?


Will you pardon me my Lord?


Yes if thou have.


I have my Lord, and am overjoyed to hear so well of my Nephew.


You may hear more anon, come all along with me.


I may hear more anon, your Lordship though knows not of what so well as I do
know


I Need not cast thee off, or bid thee go Now, and for ever from me, thine own
shame Will force thee hence


You are deceived in that.


What is thine own take with thee, here it is all Phebe.
Thou ever getst, or can expect from me.

She was mine own before your wife became our coupler, in English plain our
Bawd


Use no uncivil Language while you are well.


For which you have your witnesses, this false Traitor, that brought you on.


By my direction George.


No Traitor neither fince you left to be my Master, wounded and turned me off.


And this dark Lantern here, this old deceptio visus, That juggled the wrong
party into my Bed


Ha, ha, ha.


Do you grin Grim Malkin? But sweet Madam, if your fine Springall Bellamy had
lien there in my stead she would ha^ brought the right party; your Ladyships
Lilly white self


How Is that?


No more of that good George.


Nay, it shall out, since you have wrought my ruin, I will be the destruction
of you all; And therefore now hear me O Knight, and first resolve to make me
rich in my reward, for wonders i will unfold


Can thou expect reward from me for any thing that can by thee be utterd?


Reward? why not? why should not you reward my good Offices as well as punish
my ill? I must and will rely upon you for all the good that can befall me; or
if I must expect no further from you, i will give't you gratis, And if you be any
thing but a Wittall hear me


What do you mean?


To set you out livelyer, then all your paintings: or dee hear, will you give
me a hundred pound a quarter for my silence


Not a penny; if you seek my undoing, heaven forgive you.


What (Villain) can thou speak to her prejudice?


That which (if you are no Wittall) you will be leath to hear, but you shall have
it


Dare thou talk so?


And since you hold my attempt at her, so heinous, you may be pleased to know I
was incited to it by example of him I named, that smooth Faced Bellamy


Dare thou accuse her with him?


You may ask her bolster there, her Madam Nurse old Mother Cock broth.


O me.


I, O you ask her sir, what she did with him, or he with her, in their two
hours privacy in her chamber, when he came to take up five hundred pound for
his Lord, There was a sweet taking up, sir she confessed all to me, and on
purpose, I dare be sworn to embolden me in my attempt to her Ladyship


I confess?


What did she confess?


That he made use of your Bed with your wife, what language shall I utter't
in? you were best fee it done before you believe it


O me most miserable if this be true!


Well, there is for them two.


Go Closet till I call you.


Now for that Rogue (because I must expect no further good of you, but this
which is mine own you say) i will lay him open to you, you remember how once I
ingratiated my self to you by rescuing you from a Robbery and Murder (as you
supposed) for which you took me into favor --


Yes, and have wished a thousand times since, that I had lost the thousand
pound I had about me then, and taken some wounds for it in exchange rather then
by that rescue to have taken thy Viperous self into my bosom


This Rogue plotted that business, 'twas a mere trick of his invention. The
supposed Thieves were his companions, and wrought by him only to scare you and
run away when we came to your succor, only to indeare me to you. There was
no hurt meant, but the slap I gave him over the Pate to color the business,
with little blood, I wish now I had cleft his brains


Your wish though against your will is a good reward to him, for I love him the
better for his wit in that plot, and care of his then Master


Do you so sir? Then 'twas mine own invention, let him deny't if he can.


Indeed the plot was his sir, I only found the Actors.


I cannot condemn the conceit however; and am something taken with the wit
on it, would all the rest were no worse


And now I have utterd my whole mind sir, and you declard I must expect no
further good of you, come away Phib, I have injured thee long, i will make the^
now amends for all; i will marry thee, and sell Tobacco with thee


Let him not go sir, I beseech you in this desperate way, nor till I answer to
his accusation


Sir you shall stay, and make your self good before authority, or clear my
wife


You Will have your house then known to have been a bawdy house?


The Courts of Princes and Religious Houses May so have been abused.


Under such Governesses.


You Will anon be silent, what is the matter? we are busy.


Mistress Crostill, Madam is come in great have to visit you, and a Kinseman of
your Ladyships with her


At such a time? excuse your self.


They are here sir, enterd against all resistance.


Mistress Crostill! you have much honored me --
Cozen Fitzgerrard! welcome.

I have a private suit to you Madam.


Pray Mr. Thrivewell entertain the Lady.


Another sprunt youth.


Sir, I perceave some discontent here, I hope your*
Nephew has not again displeased you?

He is a villain, seeks my utter ruin,


Pray say not so, for fear you force me love him.


You are undone for ever if you do.


Do not say so, for fear I fly to him,
The thought of him already breaks my sleeps,
I could not rest to night for thinking of him,
Which made my early have to unload my mind,
Presuming that your judgment may excuse
A simple Woman's weakness, what is she
That he courts so?

I tell you, she is a Whore with Child by him, lays claim to him, and I think
he will marry her


Still you speak better of him, and my love must not see him so lost, sir let
me speak with you


Me Lady? I am busy; I am busy.


What metal am I of? his scorne's a Lodestone;
No Courtship like his carelessness to me;
And all dispraise speaks for him,
Sir I will speak with you.

I blush for you, what would you say now, were it not too late?


Nay only to your ear.


Stand off a while Phib.


His Lordship Madam shall give me account
To each particular.

You shall do well to put it to him Cosen --
Husband, I overheard you, and commend you,
That though you cast your Nephew from all hopes
Of good from you, you will not yet destroy
His fortunes other ways.

How do you mean?


For that I find by your reviling him
You more inflame that cross fantastic Widow
With eager love to cast her self upon him.

Had I thought so, I had spoke well of him Against my conscience.


No, let me entreat you.
Be that way charitable, and speak worse;
The worse the better.

Tempt me not good Lad^,
To your own prejudice, your destruction;
I am one you cannot live and lie withal
A fortnight you, alas you are but a grissell,
Weak picking meat; Here Is one will hold me tack,
Seven constant ordinaries every night,
Noonings, and intermealiary Lunchings,
At freedom every day, hold belly hold,
The Cupboord never shut.

I understand you not.


Nor mind me Lady; Twill be better for you.
You had a thin chin'd husband, played at Doublets with ye,
And that perhaps, but twice or thrice a week,
You are incapable of better Game,
Here Is one shall hold me Tick tack night by night,
And neither of us guilty of a Why-not,
She Is bred up to my hand, and knows her play.

Can you so slight me?


Slight? I honor you.
In caring for you to preserve your life,
And your estate, which I confess my self
Unworthy of: besides I am engaged
To do a poor soul right for my issues sake
She goes withal.

But say on composition she acquit you.


O but conscience is conscience.


I Will die or have him presently.
Can you refuse me for a prostitute whore?

Take heed what you say, i will shake your estate,
If you dare call her whore before witnesses.

Call all the World to hear me Madam,
Sir Anthony, and the rest, be all my witnesses;
Give me your hand sir, here before you all
I plight my faith upon this Gentleman,
He is my Husband, and I am his Wife.

You are then undone.


I care not sir, for your ill will: no more shall he.


Are you caught Widow? Future, for Unkles now?


Why answer you not me, in troth plight?


I do, but yet I tell you again conscience is conscience;
The Woman's not compounded with.

I Will give her a brace of hundred pounds.


The Woman will not take it.


The Woman shall take it, for now know sir, I love you not so ill as to undo
you. This Woman has been mine as much as yours, she has done as much with me
for Offices, and Service I have done for her, as she has done with you for
Love and Money, let her deny't


I have lately suspected so.


And if her Friends will make her brace of hundreds a leash i will marry, and
honestifie her


Honest Wat in good earnest ^ Gentlewoman with your hand give him your consent,
and i will supply you with the od hundred pound, for Wats love to his Master


Will you?


Yes, and with your allowance; it shall be in lieu of the hundred I took in
Commodity of her Kinswoman Mistress Saleware, which would never thrive with me
(as it may properly with them) as 'twas the price of lust you know it was, and
how untowardly things have chanced amongst us since it was so; And now that I
have declined it, you shall se^ how sweetly all will be reconciled


Do as you please.


Go get you to the Priest presently, and bring him hither for thy Master, Wat.


Madam you sent for me, though I had former cause to require a conference with
you


My cause my Lord, is almost ended among our selves. Pray let your former
therefore be determined first, your Lordship may be pleased to sit


I desire first by good Sir Anthony's patience, Madam a word with you in
absence of all the rest, except this Gentlewoman


With all respect my Lord.


No you shall stay, and all the rest, speak openly my Lord, I do beseech you.


My modesty forbids.


I Will speak it for you then; Good my Lord sit judge* This Woman comes to
accuse me of incontinency with your servant Bellamy, is it not so


I marry dos she Madam to make her word good to my Lord that he would have
lien with her too; And says that Bellamy affirmed to her that he did, I mary
did he with your Ladyship


Ha, ha, ha, I have a Nephew here affirmed as much.


I am sorry I said so much, 'twas but my suspicion in the days of my
wickedness, I am honest now, and can think no such matter -- O is the parson
come --


I fear I shall be wretched.


You are wretched in your fear, note your Wifes confidence; Can Guilt look
with that Face


I understand that Bellamy is in your house.


Forth coming my good Lord. Good Master Bellamy, fetch your Nephew, you will
find him in my Chamber


And in this respect you shall give me leave
My Lord to call your honor into question.

You Are very ^ound with me Mr. Fitzgerrard,
What is your question?

Where is my Sister Amie?


Ask you me?


Yes, and in honor you are to answer me,
It is too evident, your courtship won
Her Virgin honor.

Then I forced her not.


The blame of that lay therefore on her self,
That loss I seek not after: but I ask
Her life and being (if she live or be)
Of you my Lord, since it is manifest,
She left her friends, and Country shortly after
Her folly had betrayed her into shame,
To be at your dispose, as we presume
She is since in her two years absence; we
Have sought all other ways in vain; you shall
Do therefore well my Lord to render her,
Or give me leave to urge you ^'an account
Of what is become of her.

You cannot sure
Compel me sir.

To hazard of my life I will my Lord.


That she is lost I am grieved; But for your stout demand i will answer you at
Weapons, time and place convenient


I Will end your difference Cosen Fitzgerrard, here is your Sister Amie my Lord,
here is your servant Bellamy, whom I preferred to you as my Nephew, to be a
Go-betwixt you and Mistresses, which quality I now abhor, as I could wish
your Lordship would leave -- Wenching for this inconstant Woman's sake that
would be prostitute unto your servant. 'Twas a flat bargain, and but a flat
one, but for the nonperformance her husband may thank their party of Sex, not
his wifes want of desire


Nere the sooner for a hasty word I hope.


What further end she had to serve your Lordship she may relate her self.


Lost to my self, and friends being made unfit
In any other Region to appear,
And more unable to live other where;
Then in the presence of my loved Lord
(Although not as my self) I did assume
That Masculine boldness* so to let you know
My Lord, that I more fully could subsist
By the mere sight of you, and so contain
My self, then she your more respected Mistress
Could in the rich and plentiful enjoyments
Of your most real, and essential favors.

Sweet let us speak aside.


What ails my Friend? is not all this now but a plot to make me jealous?


I am discovered and undone.


Nere the sooner for a hasty word I hope Friend. Come leave your waggery, is
not all this but a plot now to make me jealous


Your Plot good Mistress Saleware would not hold.


Nor shall it hold good Madam, I cannot be jealous, Sapientia mea mihi.


Yet the young Gentleman (such as you see he is) has lien with me of old,
before I was married; do not look so dismaydly, I will not detect you with my
husband for a hundred pound --


Nor will I be jealous for a thousand Madam, your plot's too weak Facks, but
where is my injured Kinswoman, Madam


O Phebe Gin crack! she is by this time righted, that is Married.


Sapientia mea mihi, again then for that, that was my plot, and it held Madam.


My dear, dear Amie, and my Bellamy,
I do commend your vow of future chastity,
Vowing the same my self, and here before
Your Brother, and these friends to help your marriage
I freely give you two hundred pounds a year
During your life.

Now do you note the effect of all Sir Anthony?


I do with my much joy.


And Mistress Saleware, for your falsehood
(Which I forgive, because you are a Woman)
I quit familiarity with you, and advise you
To love your husband, giving him no cause
Of fear or jealousy.

Your Lordship counsels well.


Hang fears and jealousies, I would there were no greater in the Kingdom,
then in Tom Salewares Coxcombe; But by your favor friend, we will be friends
no more, but loving man and wife henceforward


That shall be as you please.


See new Married couples, please your Lordship to take notice?


Uncle and Madam, I am come to call you to my house to Dinner, and your
Lordship if you please, and all the rest here, I want one, my Rival Bellamy,
where is he? we will be all friends to day; and at night sweet heart, -- at
night, at night, at night --

We Will get the Boy that shall become a Knight


You promise lustily.


And Phebe if thou be not better provided already, if I get not thee with
Squire, let me turn clown


But where is this Bellamy, what new Ladies that?


This new Lady sir, is that Bellamy you inquire for.


The same Gentleman that you accused your Aunt with.


That I confess had line with her.


Ha, is it so in faith? and (now I think on it) in troth I thought so; would I have
tax'd'her think you, but with a Woman? pray Mr. Bellamy let me salute your
lips, and good Uncle now we are Neighbors, and both good Housekeepers, let
us not be strangers to one another


Well sir, as I shall find you by your wifes report I shall be still your
Uncle


I shall be his heir in spite of the Devil, and all his works and mine.


Come Madam, I find here is Music, let us lead the Brides a Dance to stir
their appetites to Dinner


And now my Lord to grace our Wedding feast,
As you in honor are the greatest Guest
You have full power to welcome all the rest.

WEll! had you Mirth enough? much good may't do you,
If not, it is more then I did promise to you.
It Is your own fault, for it is you, not we
Make a Play good or bad; and if this be
Not answerable to your expectation
Ye are the freeborn People of this Nation,
And have the power to censure Worth and Wit,
But we must suffer for what you commit.
Yet wee're resolved to bear your gentle Hands,
And if you will tie us in any Bands,
Let us be bound to serve you, and that is thus,
To tell you truth, as long as you serve us.
