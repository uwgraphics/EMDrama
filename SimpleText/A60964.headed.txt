THey who must write (for writings a Disease)
Should make it their whole study how to please:
And that is a thing our Author fain would do;
But wiser Men, than he, must tell him how:
For you're so changeable, that every Moon,
Some upstart whimsie knocks the old ones down.
Sometimes bluff Heroes please by dint of Arms:
And sometimes tender Nonsense has its Charms:
Now Love, and Honor strut in buskined Verse:
Then, at one leap, you stumble into Farce.
Like true Fanatics, never long content
With any settled Form of Government:
Eager in choice, as eager in forsaking;
You first blaspheme the Gods of your own making.
Let Poets henceforth lay their Rules aside;
And take some ruling Planet for their Guide:
No more frequent their famed Parnassus's tops;
Unless it be to place their Teliscopes:
For such as hope to merit your esteem,
Must quit their Horace, and erect a Scheme.
Thus they may find a way to please the Pit,
Provided they insure their Plays from Wit.
Our Author, this way doubtless of Success,
(For some Men have no Stars, as Lilly says)
Himself, and Play, upon the Boxes throws,
From perfect Beauty's, to imperfect Beaus.
To you, fair Sirs (for I must call you so,
Since Art, in spite of Nature, makes a Beau)
Who in side Box, in seeming Judgment sit,
Like Barron-Tell-Clocks to attend the Pit;
In all humility he does submit.
Not that he needs to doubt you for his Play:
We know your Courage lies another way.
Nor will he Court you, like some servile Elves,
Who flatter you as much, as you your selves:
Let them proclaim the Conquest of your looks;
That bugbear word shall never burn his Books.
You, Ladys, he adores, and owns your Charms,
More powerful, than the greatest Monarchs Arms.
Hopes the kind Heavens will all your Wishes grant,
Whether they be for Husband, or Gallant:
Nay, Bath, and Wells, at once, if both you want.
Not doubting your good Nature for a Man,
Who, to oblige you, does the best he can.

Gayman and Granger, from Play.

A Pox on your Bassett: Catch me at that damned Game, this Twelvemonth again,
and may I live to value my self upon the Modish Reputation of a gentile
Tallieur


And that has made a Fortune before now.


It never shall make mine: Death! I have no patience to be eternally jilted by
Alpieus. --


But not the Ladies, Granger.


The Ladies? There lies the secret: When you design a Bank, you first consider
what Beauties you shall get to draw in Custom: And I could tell you, as a
certain Lord did, when asked, why he never played at my Lady Pampockett's. --


As how, pray?


Why, since you press me -- I don't like your Women.


Sure you forget my Charming Lady Trickitt: And that is Inhospitable in her own
House


No, faith, I have her in my thoughts, a fresh Idea of her, and her little
Cheats; her nauseous toss, and all those Affectations, that ought to make a
Woman odious to Men of sense


Gad a mercy, St. George for England!

Now would your Man of Travel and true Dress, be transported, with what your
right born Britain finds such fault with; and think these little agreements of
absolute necessity to make a Mistress relish


To make a Mistress relish! to make a Mistress stink of the familiarity of half
the Town: I must own my want of good breeding; the Hogo's much too strong for
me


Thou Monster of ingratitude! I heard this very Woman, within this Month, say,
there was not so agreeable a Man in Town, as Mr. Granger; so generous a Friend;
and so good humored a Gentleman; especially upon a winning hand. --


Why there is the Devil on it: One Night, about that time, she lost her Money,
and I was lucky: She, to my Face, cried up the Generosity of those, who make
their Friends partakers of their good Fortune: And I was too well satisfied
with mine to contradict her: Next Morning, she sent to speak with me; on
earnest Business, which was, to borrow 500 Guinny's; promising to repay me;
with such a Grace, that no one, who had not the Honor to know her Ladyship,
could have had the Heart to refuse her


And how could you retire like a Man of Honor?


I told her, mine was a Younger Brother's Fortune; not to be ventured but on
good Security; she indeed kindly proffered me the best she had about her. --


And so you Signed, and Sealed?


No, faith, without advising with Counsel, I knew 'twas so encumbred with Fops,
and Blockheads, there was nothing in remainder for a reasonable Man: There Is
not a Rogue so nauseous, but is welcome to her for his Money: All that will be
Losers, Lenders, or Givers, have an equal claim to her good Graces: From the
grinning stinking Lord, to the fat Booby Squire, whose unsavory Vapors would
offend the Ladies Noses, in any Ruel, but her Ladyship's


But what say you, to my lovely Lady Malepert? She Is more particular; One Man
at once suffices there


Would it were always to be her Husband.

That a Woman, at Eighteen, an Age, when Love, and Pleasure used to rule,
should in the midst of Plenty, value her self upon the Reputation of a
Publican, and always sit at the Receipt of Custom! Rot her, she has less mercy
than a Mountebank's Bill: No Cure, no Money, is a moral Honesty in the Surgeon;
but no Money, no Cure, is only the Conscience of a Whore


Prejudice of Education, Granger: Her Inclinations may be good, and Wishwell's
influence overruled 'em: She governs there, and Interest governs her


Nay, Mrs. Wishwell's the very Flower of modern Industry, and shows a
Master-stroak in all she does: First, to insinuate, at her Age, into the
Inclinations of this young Lady; then, with her Character, to persuade the
Family, she was a fit instructor for her; and which is more, to make Lord
Lofty, though turned of Fifty, agreeable to almost Fifteen


But above all, to break the League 'twixt her, and her Lord's Aunt, my Lady
Susan, who though a Friend to the Projection, could not endure to have it brought
about by any but the Family


Yes, that Youthful Virgin of five and forty, with a swelling Rump, bow Legs,
a shining Face, and colly'd Eyebrows (of what breath she pleases) sure she is an
Original: It Is the most familiar Duck, always engaged a Month before hand:
She Would no more miss a Ball, than the curling her little finger, when she eats,
though she hobbles worse than Abigall in the Scornful Lady, when she has broke
her Crupper


No matter for all that, I am obliged to her.


O yes, by, having the Honor to be your Bawd, she thought to recommend her
self to be my Mistress


Despising her, as you do, why are you so often with her? Your visits are as
regular as my young Masters to the crooked Heiress, whom his prudent Parent has
picked out, to be the future Blessing of the Family


Why, to confess my Sins, and blush for all at once -- since I refused Trickitt
the 500 Pound, I don't know what the Devil's the matter with her, but she has
made me some advances, that have put me into a Curiosity of knowing the meaning
of 'em. But, Damn her, while I believe her endeavoring to persuade me that
she is in Love with me, I think I am in Love with her: I cannot see to the end
on it: But she, and my worthy Lady Susan, being, as you know, inseparable, I
need explain no farther


Speaking of Trickitt, as you have always done, I durst have sworn of her whole
Sex, she was the last in your opinion


And so she is.


And yet you follow her.


I consider the Principles of a Mistress, no more than of a good Companion,
they are both the Instruments of pleasure for the time; and to be trusted with
nothing beyond that meeting


But can you Love without esteem?


Why, you Court Lady Malepert; you can have no real esteem for a Woman of her
mercinary Character


Could I reclaim her, I should be happy: At least the, Trial will be pleasant.


How does this agree with your Passion for Maria? Can you be false to her?


She will not let me be true to her: I have tried her every way, but one; and that
one way, that high way of Matrimony, 'twill come to at last, I believe


I always thought Wishwell your Friend, in this Business.


The Lord has got the better of me: yet I will visit her again, to get her into
my Interest, if I can; if I fail in that, I shall at least have the pleasure of
railing at her


Nay, never think of curing the Mercenary Itch in an Old Woman: It Is the very
Tetter of that Sex: and more or less, breaks out upon 'em all: The young ones
are not clear on it


Here comes the Noble Lord Malepert, and that Minor of Chivalry, Sir Ruff
Rancounter: their Conversation should be diverting; let us stand back and
observe 'em


Granger, methought, used your Lordship a little scurvily: I wonder you could
bear it; for my part, I always make mince-meat of any Fellow that offers but
half so much to me


Pish, he lost his Money, and I teased him; these things are nothing between
us: Besides, I am witty upon him in my turn, I call him Wasp


Nay, I must allow you are too hard for him at Repartee: but a Man of Honor,
my Lord, should never put up the least indignity: You never see him offer the
like to Gayman


Who? Gayman? Lord! he is the servil'st Fellow, the Ministers do so laugh at him.


Why, he will fight, my Lord.


O Jesu! Sir! I never said any thing to the contrary: He Is a very worthy
Person; I always reckon him among my best Friends, whatever I say of him: I
assure you he did all his Exercises at the Academy to a Miracle: He and I rid
the great Horse together


The great Horse! my Lord? sure you forget your self, your Lady's Padd went a
great way with you


Why really, Sir Ruff, you will not believe me;

But I became the manage so well, that I verily believe I had been in the Army,
but for one thing --


What was that, pray?


Why, they said Riding too much would teach me to turn in my Toes, and spoil my
Dancing; and you know a Body would not do that for less than a Regiment; and
they offered me but a Troop. Was you at the Play last Night


Yes, what of that?


Was Wishwell there? Well, she is the best Woman.


You have cause to say so.


Yes, really, she is always so particular to me: I have seen her so play upon my
Lord Lofty when he was much a greater Man than I


Has not she played for him too, my Lord?


This Blockhead will tell him he is a Cuckold to his Face.


Well, my Wife's mightily obliged to her:

She Is admitted to her Toilett, when she is abroad to Dutchesses: then she gave
her the finest Present of Stuffs a Board an East India Ship, Lofty had but just
given it her: I am to have a Gown and Slippers of it my self


Yes, and a Nightcap too. Can this Puppy be so blind, not to know who made his
Wife that Present


When was you at Mrs. Siam's?


Last Night, at Ten, we raffled there, Lord Lofty, Wishwell, my Wife, and I: My
Wife sent me home for more Money; but before I came back, where do you think
they were gone? -- Why, even to Wishwell's, where we had the prettiest Supper:
After we rose from Table, Wishwell took me aside, as she used to do, to rail
with her, at the Vices of the Age; I thank her, she knew which way to oblige me
--


And the whole Company.


Why, after all, this was no Complement to my Lady.


Why, Lord, Sir Ruff, you don't think we left her alone: we were better bred, I
assure you: my Lord and she went into the little Room, with the Crimson Couch,
to talk of State Affairs: Now you must know my Wife understands State Affairs
to a Miracle: She picks up all the News of the Drawing Room, to inform me of at
Night; for her whole Business, you must know, is to make me rise --


Out a Bed from her, I believe you.


Would she had a better Employment.


To make you rise! it is lost Labor very often, my Lord; for, after all, you
don't look much like a Man of Business


O Lord, Sir! you're mistaken in me; I love State Affairs mightily; and
understand 'em, though I say it, passably well: Why, I had a Politic Master all
the while I was in France; without Vanity I got off a Sheriff, this Winter, in
spite of the Commissioners


Was not Maria with you at Wishwell's?


Ay, ay, Maria came in, and interrupted us; Maria came in -- a Lady of your
Acquaintance, -- as good a Maid, though I say it --


Though you say it? what can you say of her?


Why, thou have such an akeing Tooth after that Maidenhead of hers; but she
will not marry you: Besides she has no Maidenhead


Has your Lordship no Coxcomb?


Why, what do you mean, Sir Ruff? I never was asked such an uncivil Question in
all my Life. Jesu! may not a Man make a Jest, or so, upon a Friend, in a civil
way


Not where my Honor, or the Honor of my Mistress, is concerned.


Pish, I honor her as much as you do: I think her Virtuous, let the World say
what they will of her


Will that repair the Injury? Dammee, I Will have Satisfaction, or I Will wring
your Neck off


Help there, Treason, I am the Lord Malepert, seize him some Body -- But, dear
Sir Ruff, I meant no harm in the World? but as I love railing mightily, I cannot
forbear a witty Jest sometimes --


Damn your dull Jest:
This Place and Company protect you:
And so Adieu Lord Loggerhead.

Mr. Granger, Mr. Gayman, your Servant: Were you at the Park last Night?


Was your Lordship a Hunting with the King?


Jesu! la Hunting? No, God forbid. You have the prettyest
Trimming, Mr. Granger.
Did you buy it at the French Protestants?

That Is a question for my Tailor?

Who was he that left you just now?


Honest Sir Ruff. Does the Queen see Company?


He used your Honor something coursely, I thought.


Pish, it is a Pleasant Blustering Fellow, I allow him all his Humors, and he
knows mine


It seems he does.


Now you must know I am very quiet, and good natured, 'till I am vexed, but
then I Am the Devil --


At Twelve I Will meet you in the Park.


Stay, stay, we'll go together.


Did you lose to Night, Mr. Granger?


Did your Lady Sup at Mrs. Wishwell's?


Pish, did you win then?


Did my Lord Lofty Sup there too?


Very foolish; were you a Saver then?


Zounds! did you leave 'em alone?

That Is the way for you to be a winner.


Well, my Wife does so laugh at him, when we are alone: she is only Civil to him,
because he is a Relation: She says his Conversation's so out of Fashion; and if
he should pretend to make Love --


She would make very good sport with him.


I dare swear for her.


Yes, I vow now, for I assure you, she has a world of Wit, as my Aunt Susan
says: She Will play upon me sometimes before Company; but that you know is the
fashion --


What, to play upon your Lordship?


Pish, no, I mean to use a Husband negligently in public; but then she is so
fond of me in private: Nay, Faith, out Humors jump to a hair, she will rail to a
Miracle, and you know I love railing mightily. But do you resolve to quit
Basset


Dam it, 'twas invented by the Levellers, and suited to all Capacities; it is
the Devil and all, to lose always to Fools


I always to lose too, but witty Men,

You know, are seldom lucky.


I must to my Lodgings; send some Rouleaus to the Bank, to pay my damned Debts,
and learn to be wiser for the future: Shall I have your Honor's Company


Jesu! Mr. Granger, I beg you Ten Thousand Pardons; I covet no Man's Company so
much as yours; but I must go to Sir Feminine Fanviles, drink Tea at Siam's, and
then to the Levees of three Privy Counselors


You're a necessary Man to 'em.


Why, really, bar Sir Faminine, there is not a Man in Town carries 'em fresher
News


Nay, he is a Prodigy of Intelligence.


And very well with the Ministry, upon my word:

No matter who is in play, he sticks to the Offices, and not the Men; there is
not a word spoken in the Playhouse, Chocolate-House, or Drawing Room, but he
gives 'em an account of


You forget the Coffee-Houses.


O filthy! he leaves them to such as can endure the stink of Tobacco: No, he is
too delicate for that, and I believe nothing less than the betraying the
Secrets of a bosom Friend, could persuade him to speak to a Man that came out
of one: I went to him from visiting an Old Aunt, that was taking a Pipe

The Smoke, I believe, got into my Perriwig, but he smelt me out immediately,
and made his Valet de Chamber turn me down stairs; I must say that for him

Nay, I vow he is an extraordinary fine Gentleman,

And knows a Fool, as well --


As your Lordship.


Yes, I vow now, does he: Gad so, it is almost Eight a Clock, So dear Mr.
Granger, and Mr. Gayman, your Servant

You Will be at my Aunt Susan's this Afternoon; it is her day you know.


Infallibly, my Lord.


What luck's this, Child? to win of Sir Limber Lowly, and my Lady Sinker, (both
desperate Debts) lose all our ready Money, besides a Sum to Granger


Did Mr. Granger win? I came in late, you know.


Upon my Life, Child, we owe him a Hundred and Fifty Pound.


I take your word, Madam, but indeed I thought he had been a Loser, I Am sure he
fretted at the usual rate


You mistake him, Child, it is his Humor, he is as hard to please, as a Sick
Monkey; and when he is

It fits as awkardly upon him, at a French Suit on a young Spaniard, newly set
out to Travel


Mr. Granger's Man's to wait on your Ladyship.


Tell him I Am gone to Bed, bid him come after Dinner, and the

Money shall be ready --

He Is strangely pressing; methinks

He might have stayed 'till next Basset --

Now if this Fellow be Fool enough not to understand me, and should bring in
the Money, all will be discovered


Madam, he says, Mr. Granger

Gives his Service to your Ladyship, and has sent

You the Hundred and Fifty Pounds he lost to the Bank.


Well, this sitting up does so prey upon the memory:

Why, I durst have sworn we owed him that Sum:

Well, Child, as't happens, this is no ill Night to thee.


Thanks to the timely Message --


They come so seldom, but Mr. Granger's the most punctual Man.


He Is every way a Man of Honor.


So Waspish, there is no living with him:

Of all things, he is my aversion.


I must be better satisfied of that, before I believe you.


He Is sometimes Splenetick indeed, but it is through so much good Sense, and
Breeding, it is rarely seen, and always diverting


Dear Maria, how can you say this? Did you ever know him Offer at a Civil
thing? No, it is an arrant Churl

And for the Honor you mention, Mr. Garnish,

He talks too much of it, to have more than his share.


I Will not dispute his Character with you:

Shall we meet anon at my Lady Susans?


I Will not fail you, Child, she is one of the Gang.


I take my leave.


Adieu Maria, adieu dear Child --

Why what a Credulous Creature this is!


Lord, Madam, how can you impose so upon your Friend?


Tell me of Friendship, no, as my Lord says

There Is no true Friend, but Money --


How, Madam?


And your self. But let us get as much Money as we can; 'twill secure your
Friendship to me


It cannot need such a security -- Well, Madam, You have reconciled me to some
things -- for your Service


And for your own, good Sir.


That I could never have thought on, for my self.


And you have persuaded me to another thing --


For both our Services.


That I would have done for no body else.


There Is no repenting of any thing I can do, for you,

Or with you; I am a Slave to all your Interests,

Employ your Cunning, I Will assist your Arts;

Cheat all your Friends, but me.


Cheat you?


Has Mr. Granger done any thing to make him your aversion?

You will not allow him to be a Man of Honor;

Have you a mind to put him to the Trial?

When you refuse a Man a Commendation that every body gives him, you must
pardon me, If I think, it is for some private reason of your own

Besides, I never knew a Woman declare an unreasonable aversion for a Man in
public, that had not a mind to have a better opinion of him in private


What, you are jealous of him?


Not jealous, Madam: But it is a weakness to be too secure: While I rallied to
the Company, I had my Eyes about me, and indeed by what you looked, or did, or
said to him, I could not find out your aversion


A very Boyish jealousy indeed! He lost to us, And I was civil to him; nay,
civil to his losses, not to him

I can do more to serve the common cause,

So certain to our Interest --


I do believe you can do what you please; and I Will watch your pleasure --


Is your Lord stirring yet, Florence?


He has been in his Dressing Room this half hour, Madam.


Then it is as I would have it; and a fair time for me to go to Bed -- I come --


Shall we meet this Afternoon?


Not this Afternoon, I have Business; hardly this Week I fear: I hope I Have
satisfied your jealousy: you don't know enough of me --


I do know enough, enough to satisfy me,

There Is no knowing more than she has a mind to:

And all the knowledge our weak search can find,

But proves, there is no knowing Womankind.


PRithee leave sidling, it is well enough.


Madam, you would have your things sit handsomely.


Decently, I would; what you call handsomely, is a niceness, would as ill become
me, as a Sultana did a fat body, or a high Commode a lean Face; and only serve
to make my decays more remarkable


Will you please to use the Wash. --


I use the Wash! A Woman turned of fifty, was never designed to be looked upon:
I may Wash, and Patch, and please my self; cheat my hopes, with the daily
expense of Plaster, and Repairs; No body will take the Tenement off my hands.
Men use us, as we use our Spectacles, to draw the Object nearer to the Sense:
Indeed we are the fittest means, to guide and light their dark designs home to
their ends on younger Women. No matter for the Character; I live by them, and
they shall Love by me

While I am Mistress of Malepert's Beauty, I am not very sensible of the loss
of my own: For her sake I will be Courted: I have so many howd'yees, and
invitations in the Morning upon her account; so many visits in the Afternoon;
and so many Bows in the Drawing Room at Night


For her sake you have so many Rafflings, and whoever throws most, you win the
prize: For her sake, my proud Lord Lofty, who scarce bows to Heaven, cringes to
you, and for her sake the whole Town calls you Bawd


Time has been, when by the merits of my own Face -- but


I had almost forgot, Madam, Mrs. Lucy was here this Morning, and desires you
to remember Mr. Oglewell of the Temple


She may rest her self contented; he is not for her turn: Mrs. Siam sent her
Maid to his Chambers yesterday, in the Afternoon too, his Man denied him at
first, but afterward confessed, his Master was in Bed with a fine Gentlewoman
(one of the common fine things of the Town -- I suppose) and would not be
disturbed


How, Madam! pretend to marry Mrs. Lucy for Love, and be in Bed with another!


Nay, now, he will hardly marry for Love, since he has found a remedy for Love,
without marrying


Base Man! does not he fear a Judgment will follow him? Had it been a Match, I
was to have 50 Pound of her, for putting your Ladyship in mind of it


And did the Fool believe I would turn Match-maker in my Old Age?


Why, Madam, it is no such Dishonorable Character.


But it is Ridiculous, and that is worse: No, give me an Office, where I may have
thanks for what I do: Go, get the Chocolate -- and remember I am at home to no
body, but Lady Malepert

It Is near the time she was to call me for the India-Houses, she turns to more
account, than any of my former Acquaintance: She has hitherto been ruled by me:
And I will keep her out of those Gentlemen's hands, if I can, who, by engaging
her, as deep as they can, into their Interest, will certainly, as soon as they
can, take her out of mine. If I may believe her, no body but Lord Lofty has yet
been happy: He grows weary of presenting; and must give place to Gamesters,
that bid more: Sir Ruff Rancounter offers very fair: While I can keep her to
Men, where she can like nothing but their Money, I am safe

Therefore that Brute shall have her:

But Gayman loves her: She likes him too:

And when the Parties are so far agreed; there is but little work for a third

Person, to bring 'em together. I fear Gayman,

As I should a French Privateer, in the Channel, without a Convoy, and all my
Fortune on board one Vessel: For he is a Master of those thriving Arts, and
little Rogueries, that cheat, and please the Women: Then to his Person, Wit,
and Industry, he has a certain respectful Impudence in his Behavior, few Women
can find fault with, or resist


Before I could give your Orders to deny you, Lord Lofty was told you were at
home


This must be by Malepert's appointment.

Wait on him up.

But now he is out at Court, he shall soon be so with her.

How! Mr. Gayman!


It Is well you named me, Madam; by the strangeness of your look, I was afraid
you had forgot me


I am surpised you should use another Name, to be admitted here; where I
command you shall always be welcome


I was sure the Name I borrowed, would carry me through this Family.


Your own can do as much.


Then it is since his disgrace: For, not three days ago, when you denied your
self to every body, and to me, among the crowd of your unseasonoble Visiters,
my Lord Lofty and Lady Malepert, were notoriously above stairs with you; above
stairs, in private with you; with you, or without you


How, Mr. Gayman! notoriously at my House?


Why, yes Faith, Madam, it was very notorious:

And you were so little cautious of concealing it,

Their Pages were at Play, all the afternoon, before the Door: It made a Jest
for every body that went by; and would have been apprehended by the very blind
Cuckold himself, had he happened in the way


It Is very well, Sir; now you show your self.


Why, Faith, I cannot help it; I must show my self,

Upon these occasions; it is every Honest Man's cause, and duty to be concerned
to find the best things so abused; to see a young Ladies Pleasures fall so
soon, into the Contempt and Scandal of the Town, through indiscretion, or
mismannagement

I don't tax you of either: But the World. --


I defy the World --


The Flesh, and the Devil too, good Madam:

But they will get the better of us all.


And you, the worst of Devils. What of the World?


Why People you know are apt to prate:

And when a Woman of Experience, as you may be, engages in these Affairs, the
World expects a Conduct suitable to your Grave Character

All the miscarriages of an Intriegue are laid on you, the Lovers are called
Fools

And you have a, worsec Name.


I see you come to rail, I laugh at you.


I came to make you merry: Laugh with me, if you please; we'll Laugh at other
People

While he was in favor, I grant you, he might be a Friend; and there was

Reason good for serving him:

But I know you are truer to the interest of the Drawing Room, than to think
any Man, that is in disgrace, can be a Friend

Since my Good Lord is down, even let him lie,

Another Man may rise out of his fall:

You cannot want Friends:

I have a hard-harted Father must dye at last;

And then I can be what you think a Friend,

Able to come up to your price of thanks: Come,

Not to get a habit of it, do a generous thing,

And let me once speak well of you.


Very well.


Come, come, I Am in the secret, and therefore fittest to be trusted now: the
Lady's an out-lying Deer; I know, you have been accessory to some of her scapes
already; and can help her over the Pale, upon occasion again, to serve a
Friend, Mrs. Wishwell


We are both beholden to you.


If I am not to be obliged to her, upon your account,

It Is but staying till my Betters are served,

And then, as you manage matters,

Every Man may hope to have her in his turn.


Madam, my Lady Malepert's coming up.


How, Madam!


To hear how kindly you can speak of her.


Forgive what I have said, my Fortune, Interest, Life, and all you shall
command


I would command your Tongue.

Thou Charming Creature!

Before ever thus, thus Dear, thus Young, thus ever killing Fair?


Dear Wishwell, I fear I have tired thy patience.


Doting to this degree, I needs must languish: But now l have you thus. --


Flattering Devil!


My passionate Gallant!


That Title you may allow me, without injuring your Lord --


There the question hangs.


How! Mr. Gayman! you're a Stranger here.


I Am sorry for that, Madam; I am every where an humble Servant of your
Ladyships


Would the Devil had her for coming so unseasonably:

I cannot avoid leaving 'em together: But the opportunity shall do him little
good

Your Ladyship will allow me a minute, and I Will be with you again --


That minute must be mine: And let a minute tell you,

What all my Life can never enough explain, how much I value you.

I wont believe it is from your own Design, that I Am thus used:

I know I Have Enemies, but wonnot think you can be one of 'em.


I never can be your Enemy.


O, no! they are outward all, not near this tender Breast,

And most unworthy to possess your Heart;

That Heart, which once you said, was wholly mine.


And was not that a fault?


It was, to break your word.


Why, did I say so?


Because then it pleased you, to speak a Truth that charmed me to be yours: And
yours I must be, use me as you will

But being yours.


Why, did I meet you here?


To tell me where I next shall meet you.


Why will you press me thus to what will ruin me?


With Wishwell, I would have it. --


If you can think it fit. --


There Is nothing fit without you.


At Siam's, this Afternoon, we Raffle there.


I Raffle for a Heart. --


Mrs. Siam, you're in your round of Visitation, I see.


I joy to find your Ladyship here: I have the sweetest things;

I have 'em in the next room to show you. Good Lord!

Mr. Gayman! how came you here? Who-ever's the better for your Company,

I Am sure, I shall have no reason to thank you for it, at this time.


Nor I neither, Pox take him --


Why, what is the matter, pray?


The matter! why, a Jealous, Old, Coxcombly Fellow, (that ought to be a
Cuckold, if I had Womanhood enough about me, to make him one) is matter enough
for all the misfortunes, that can fall upon a Woman, of my public Employment


What! my Noble Captain Drydrubb, your Husband?


Ay, ay, the Nobel Captain, as you call him:

Would he were a Captain now, to be Commanded into Flanders, that I might hope
to be rid of hi

But I Am even well enough served, I must have a Soldier, with a Pox to him: a
Man of Honor, as he calls hpimself, to Command me: One, that has outlived the
memory of being a Corporal, in the Civil Wars; and has borrowed the Title of a
Captain, only to run in Debt with


He Is Man of Honor enough, to be jealous it seems.


Yes, yes, he is Jealous enough to be a Man of Honor, if that will make him
one: But he is Jealous of himself, I suppose, and his own Honor; and that makes
him Jealous of me, and mine: But l've a plaguey Life with him, that is the Truth
on it

He follows me all over the Town,

Dogs me wherever I go: All this live-long Morning

He has been at my heels: He says I run a gadding after the Fellows, and if he
finds out my Haunts, he swears he will pepper me: Now if he has seen your Servants
at the Door, the whole World shall never persuade him, but I came upon an
Assignation with your Worship; and 'twill hardly be in the power of a Guinny,
to make him quiet again


Poor Siam! I vow she has a dismal time on it:


A dismal time on it, indeed, if your Ladyship knew all; but for Gods-sake, Mr.
Gayman, as you tender the Reputation, and quiet of a poor Woman, that have been
Younger in my time, be so kind now --


Well, Mrs. Siam, I will be so kind.


Else this overcharged Blunderbuss, will have the Impudence to come in, and let
fly among the Ladies


I Will deliver you this time from his Jealousy;

I am a Slave to the Interest of your Sex:

Your Servant, Ladies. --


Well, this Mr. Gayman is a civil Gentleman in appearance, and that is as much
as a Lady can desire in a Young Man: Truly I Am obliged to him

Shall I bring in the Stuffs, Madam? They are the newest things; I Am sure
they will please your Ladyship


Some of your stale Ware, Siam.


Upon the Faith of a Christian, Madam, they never saw this side of the World
yet; they are just out of the Indian House, and never were opened to any one,
but this Morning, to my Lady Kill-Chairman; She indeed is my very good
Customer, and bought four pieces of 'em for a Mantoa


For her whole Family sure, four pieces!


We'll look upon 'em, in the next Room, if you please.

But, Siam, what have you done about our Raffle?

Are there Subscribers enough?


I want but one, Madam: I have got a very Honest Generous Gentleman, to make
one, Sir Ruff Rancounter

If he wins, he will scorn to carry any thing out of the Company; some of the

Ladies will be the better for him.

Leave these things to me: The Men I provide for you, at my House, shall be Men
of Honor, I assure you, and for the purpose you design 'em


What purpose can such a Beast, as Rancounter, be designed for among the Women?


Why, like a Beast, to bear the burden of your Expenses upon your Pleasures.

None but such Beasts will bear 'em: Think on that.


I hate him.


I would not have you Love him: Love your self,

And then you will Love nothing but your Interest.

Come, come, a 1000 Pounds may answer for the Man:

It Is but suffering a little of his Company; and why not a little of his, as
well as more of your Husbands

They Are Beasts alike: Only this, in proportion, bids more to be received by
you

Then he can do you no Injury, either in your Quiet, or your Fame: For you can
no more be in Love with him, (which is a great Blessing in these Affairs) than
the Town can think, you ever allowed him, to be in Love with you, and is not a
Thousand Pound, a round Sum, for doing so little, and suffering nothing


But why should I do any thing against my Inclinations? I don't want the Money.


Madam, Madam, every Woman wants a Thousand Pound:

And for your Inclinations, if you allow them to get the better of you, you are
undone

There are a great many pretty Gentlemen to be had;

But what will you get by any of 'em in the end?

Just so much Experience, and Repentance for your pains: You may be in

Love with a Man, that has it in his Temper to be in Love with half the

Town; as all the Young Men are.

And how will it agree with the Pleasure of your Pride,

Or the pride of your Pleasure, to be forsaken?

No, no, no Love: We'll learn that of the Men:

For Love is Nature's Appetite Diseased:

Where we have no Concern, we are always pleased.


St. James's Park.

Did you see, Lord Malepert?


What! must it be a Tilt, Sir Ruff?


No, no, hang Fighting among Friends:

I have other Business for him; of another Nature,

Gentlemen; I make Love to his Wife.


How? how? pray recollect your self.


Nay, not that I think her any better than her Chambermaid: It Is the Woman does
my business, and not the Lady: I had rather have a prudent Practiser of the
Trade, to use as I think fit; than a Gentlewoman (that only does it now and
then, for her Diversion) to use me as she pleases

But, you know, a Man in this Town, is no body, without the Reputation of a

Quality-Entriegue:

And all that I do it for, is to talk of in Company;

And be better respected by the Women:

For you know, they generally judge,

Just as other Women have judge d before 'em.


But if the Entriegue be only on your side.


Sir, I would have you to know, it is on her side too:

Gayman, thou art a pretty Fellow, and shall be my Confident: There Is no
Living, without Communicating matters of this kind, to have both parties the
better for 'em

But, Mr Garnish, to convince you,

The Husband's strangely fond of me, and you know,

That always proceeds from the good Opinion of the Wife.


I may make use of this.


But besides, I have made Madam Wishwell, my Friend:

It costs me Money indeed; but she takes the troublesome part off my Hands: She
makes Love for me; I Am only to stand by what she says

She sends me word, we are to Raffle at Siam's in the Afternoon.


But, my Lord, and you are fallen out.


That Is no matter, if I could meet him.


Here he comes, ready for your purpose.


Give me thy Hand, dear Bully; Faith, I Am sorry you provoked me to use you so
untowardly


Really, Sir Ruff, and so am I, with all my Heart, I meant no harm, I vow and
swear: If I had not thought you my Friend, I would not have pretended to be
witty in your Company

But Faith, and Troth, you were bloody Angry.


Come, come, shall we Dine together?


With all my Heart; upon Condition, you will go with me to Siam's in the afternoon.


Nay, that is but reasonable. --


Then be it so; I Will go along with you.


Well, Siam's the best Woman in the World:

She Is the rarest Company, and has all the News.

Then she is so fond of me, that I verily believe I spend above a Thousand a

Year at her House.


Nay, Faith, then you have Reason.


I vow, I should be the worst Man in the World,

If I did not Love her,

She has done so handsomely by my Wife.


As how, pray?


Why, she heard a Noble Lord, and a Great Man at Whitehall, say, he was in Love
with her: And what do you think this good Creature did


Why, pray perhaps, that she might resist the Temptation.


O Foolish! pray? No, quite contrary:

She came to her next morning, and told her of it;

That she might be sure to avoid him.


No doubt, that was the Reason.


But, my Lord, you are not there so often as you used.


Why since her Marriage, the House is turned upside down: what do People Marry
for, but to live easy with every body? When there is no danger of a Rival

Methinks a Man should think every one his Friend:

I Am sure it is the Maxim of my Family.


It should be the Maxim of every Man, That Is Born to your Fortune, my Lord.


But the Old Captain, you must know, has got it into his Head, to be Jealous of
me, and is grown so troublesome; he cannot endure a Witty Man should come into
his Doors


You have given him Cause, my Lord.


Nay indeed, if Mrs. Siam was to be had, I believe, I stand as fair for her, as
any body

But I never had the least dishonorable Thought of her;

Never saw any thing bare of her, above her Knee:

An inviolable Friendship I must own for her;

I Love her mightily.


I thought there was something in it.


Ay, ay, no doubt on it. But we shall lose our Dinner.


Nay, I would not lose my Dinner for more than I Will speak of, at this time: my
Wife is very regular at her Meal

If I chance to lose a Meal, she says,

I an't my own Man again in a week after.


Nor your Wife's neither, my Lord; come let us be gone.


It Is almost One: Granger said he would be here.


That Friend of yours, is a pleasant, snarling Fellow, And a good Companion:
It Is pity he is so very peevish


He has a Thousand good Qualities, but they have all a tang of his testy
Humor, that shows it self in all he says, and does; like a drop of Oil left it
a Flask of Wine, in every Glass you taste it


Here the Gentleman comes to answer for himself.


Sir, my Lord, commanded me to tell you, Company Dines with him, And he desires
you would please to be there

Well, well.


Well, well.

Zounds! a Man had as good be tied to a Stake, and baited like Tom Dove, on an
Easter Monday, as be the necessary appurtenance of a Great Man's Table; they
make me as much their own, as if I were part of their side-board


What Is the matter, Mr. Granger?


Why in such a Passion?


Passion! why they use me, as if I had none about me:

They will not let me be my own Man 24 Hours together.


That Is hard indeed: But pray, who does encroach upon your Liberty?


Who? Why who should dare? But they who may do any thing: Here Is the new
Favorite Summons me to Dine with him: He sends me word there will be Company;
and, I suppose, designs to serve me up, as part of the Entertainment


Now, would many an Honest Fellow be proud of this Invitation, and think his
Fortune made by it


Why, I have known many an Honest Fellow proud of the Pox; but my Ambition does
not lie that way, nor my Inclination at present: But thither I must go, though I
was engaged to my Ld. Lofty


Will he admit of no excuse?


No, plague on it, his Messages are like Subpaena's; I may stay away, if I think
fit; but I shall pay a swinging Fine for my contempt


It Is not a Month since he was in your Favor, and Lofty could not get a good
word from you


And it is not yet a Fortnight, since he was mean enough to accept of an
Employment; and Lofty had the Soul to part with three


Sure, Granger, thou love a nodding wall; that will bury thee in its ruins;

Though it never gave thee shelter, while it stood:

As no one was the better for Lofty's Greatness, methinks it should be
difficult to be concerned for his Disgrace

I Am sure I Will condole with no Man, that would never give me cause to rejoice
with him


He mended every day.


No Faith, he kept up his Character to the last:

And had his Politics, and Honesty, been put into the Scale, the balance had
been even


This is ungenerous.


It Is what you have said of him, within this Month, and still the Man's the
fame


If you must rail, let the new Favorite be the Subject.


Why, what is his fault?


Why, he is a Favorite; that will make faults, if it find none.


You may distinguish the Man from the Favorite: He Is never the worse for
having it in his power to do good Offices

Besides his Company's good; his Table easy; and, Granger, he has always been
a friend to you


A Friend to me! A Tyrant. Has he not carried me about, like Bajazet; and made
me talk too

Zounds! does he take me for a Parrot? the Bird deserves his meat, and cleaning
of his Cage; that talks for it. You, who love the Company, and Tyranny of
Courtiers, much good may do you with it: For my part, it is a Hell to me; and
I Will keep out on it, as long as I can --


Do: talk of Hell, Old Boy? There Is a Parson in the bottom on it

I believe: For there is no Hell, no Purgatory, no Devil, but of the Clergy's
providing

What! thou have Married some old libidinous Gentlewoman? --


Not I indeed, Sir; I have occasion sufficient to be out of humor; without
having a Wife, Young, or Old, to provoke me: You must guess again


Not I, Sir, I shall not guess again: You may have it, for the keeping, if you
will not tell us what is the matter with you

But you say you're a Whore-Master?


Not I, Sir.


Not you, Sir, why may be then you are not so honest a Man:

But if you are not a Married Man, you must be a Whore-Master: And why you
should be out of humor, who carry all the Women before you

I cannot tell: Cuckoldy Husbands indeed, that come after you, have something to
provoke 'em: Grant us patience, I say


Why how now, Captain?


Why how now! ha! are you there, Sir?

Cannot all the Town suffice you, Sir? but you must be running after my
Domestic, ferriting in my Borrough


I, Captain?


Yes, you, no Captain: For all your cunning, I have found out your haunt, your
meeting place: Will no less a Bawd, than Mrs. Wishwell, serve your turn? But I
see the Ambition of the Boy; by Pompey, I smoke you: Why, what an Impudent
Fellow are you to think of making a Cuckold of a Captain

Did you ever hear of a Captain, that was a Cuckold, Sir?

'Twas in the Parliament Army, if you did, that I can tell you.

A Parliament Captain might be a Cuckold indeed;

But 'twas because he had not the King's Commission, to protect his Wife then.


There were some Cuckolds in that Army, I believe, who made use of their Horns
to toss the Cavaliers out of the Kingdom


But I was always on the King's side --


Beaten? Capt. Beaten! ay, sometimes beaten, Sir:

It Is no such wonder for a Captain to be beaten, I hope:

But I Will not be a Cuckold, Sir, not be beaten by a Distaff, a Wife: Have I
brought my Honor from Edghill, both the Newbury's and MarstonMoor, nay, and
from Worcester too, to lose in an Indian House? Then Fortune is my Foe


Faith, Captain, your Honor's safe for me:

But I could tell you.


What can you tell me, Sir, I know enough already;

And more than I care to know.


Why, I could tell you, who attempts your Honor,

If you had temper to hear me --


Temper to hear you! why I Am as temperate a Tom-titt; as mild as May: Prithee
tell me, good Boy, who


Nay, now you're engaged in Honor to tell him.


I am loath to make a Division among Friends;

But I must acquit my self, and truly I have observed some winks, and passing
familiarities between Lord Malepert, and your Wife


Nay, I thought there was no good toward, in his coming so often to the House:
But does that snivelling Pea-Chick think to make a Cuckold of me? Who have seen
all the service of Christendom, from the meeting the Scotch Army at Coldstream,
to the merry meeting at Hounslow-Heath


Nay, I have seen Mrs. Wishwell carry Whispers between 'em.


I Will demolish, by Pompey, I Will break her Windows and turn over my old Punk to
the Sessions, to answer the Battery: But for that beardless, shambling,
whay-fac'd --

They are to raffle at our House this Afternoon:

This is Wishwell's design to bring 'em together;

But I shall part them with a Clap of Thunder, by Pompey.


Well said, old Baskitbilt.


Yes, faith, I Will swinge 'em: I remember your Dammee-Boys, your Swashes, your
Tuquoques, and your Titire-Tues: Have used the Fleece, and Speering's: Thrown
Clunch at a whole Table, where half of 'emwore Velvet Patches: Had drank my Tun
of Brandy, before this puleing Puppy's Father tasted Milk. I Will ransack 'em, by
Pompey


Can we assist you, Captain?


Not that I care what any Man can do with the old Jade:

But I will not be a Cuckold, in my Old Age, Gentlemen, I will not be a Cuckold: I
can make a thrust still -- fa -- fa --


All vigor to the stump!


And, by Pompey, they shall find I am.


Will you dine with us, Captain?


Dine with you! you must lend me a Guinny then,

One little Guinny; or I must go home to the old Iezebel, and compound for a
Cuckoldom

By staying abroad as long as she pleases.


Here Is that shall prevent it.


God a Mercy, Boy!

By Pompey, now the day's again, our own: We'll go, and cherish our selves with
a good Dinner

Some Wine, and much Nants,

And then resolved for War, we'll boldly try,

Who beats up my Wife's Quarters, he, or I.


Lady Susan's Lodgings.

COme, dear Maria --


Your Ladyship's Lodgings are so neat!


Siam and I fancied all the Furniture:

We ran about to Shops three days together:

I love running about mightily.


True, Nephew, you paid Coach hire; but I vow, Maria, 'twas every bit of it my
own fancy


It Is very well fancied: and every thing in such Order!


O law! you know it is my day; and then Mr. Granger and the rest of 'em will
certainly be here


Granger's a Wit: He and I are very great;

And I love a Wit mightily.


Well, Madam, you're obliged to Mr. Granger.


O Jesu! but, dear Maria, tell me,

When, where, and how; I long to know.


Last Night at my Lady Malepert's.


Yes, I vow, and my Wife srump'd all the while, and yet did not say one word.


Well, go on, dear Child, I Am impatient --


He said you were the only Lady in Town that understood Behavior, and good
Breeding


O law! and did he?


Yes, I vow, our Family was always remarkable for good breeding.


Dear Nephew, don't interrupt her: Well, dear Child --


He said Experience had ripened you to Woman --


Yes, I vow, my Aunt was five and forty last Lammas.


Nay, Nephew, know when to hold your Tongue: Come, Maria --


But that of all things, he despised those unfledged Creatures; the Town calls
Beauties, a Company of unexperienced Girls, without the knowledge of
Conversation, in which your Ladyship excelled


Nay, my Aunt can talk as much as the best of us.


O Crimine! this was strangely obliging.


Then he said you had the sweetest Page; and he was always dressed so prettily --


Poor dear Iano. And did he like the Child? He shall see him in his Nightgown.


But you forget, Maria, he said happy the Man that were in that Child's place;
and figh'd so sillily --


Then looking scornfully at all the the Ladies --


Yes, and upon my Wife too; I assure you, she took it bloody ill of him.


He swore no Lady had Charms like yours, nor set 'em off so well --


He has not seen me in my new Mantoa yet.


Then raved on your Complexion; and for your Eyebrows --


O law! I hope he knows nothing of them.


They were the Strings of Cupid's Bow;

Your Eyes the only Arrows.


And did he say all this?


Yes, and laughed at you.


Yes, I vow, did he, and really was very foolish --


To see how out of countenance we were to hear it.


Madam, Mr. Granger and Mr. Gayman are coming up.


Lord! what shall I do?


What! afraid to be seen with your Aunt?


No, I vow now, I an't afraid: but I would not have my Wife know it for the
World though


Well, Nephew, go into my Closet:

There Is Quarles upon the Japan Table for you.


What the Book with Pictures! nay, then, it is well enough; I Will go in, divert
my self.


Divert himself! Jesu! did you ever hear such an unseemly Expression before
Ladies


Unseemly, Madam!


O law! Child, he had even as good have told us what he was going about: But,
dear Maria, pull down my Mantoa; they are just a coming


Mr. Granger, Mr. Gayman, your humble Servant.


I never saw any thing so pretty as your Ladyships Sconces.


You're so obliging: And how do you like'em, Mr. Granger?


As they are your Ladyship's I must admire 'em.


They were made in France, I assure you, by Madam's own Workman -- Child, bid
my Woman set Chairs --


Would we might have her Company, instead of the Ladies.


Your Ladyship's Woman's very pretty.


And has a World of Wit, I assure you.


There Is no body so much set off by a handsome Woman, as your Ladyship.


O law! that is particular --

But, Mr. Granger, do you think her pretty?


By reflection from your Ladyship.


Still paticular --

Mr. Granger, shall I beg a word with you?

It Is Business; I hope the Company will pardon me.


What an affected doting Fool's this? How can you bear her?


I must be civil to her for the sake of her Relations.


You Will be at Siam's about five.


I Will not fail.


I Will ask for you --


Never to be forgiven --

But, Mr. Gayman, have you seen the Stuffs at Siam's? there are three or four
the sweetest Pieces: I bought the Red and Silver for a Night Gown


'Twill certainly become your Ladyship.


Pinks and Lillies: exactly her Complexion.


O law! Sir! Well, I wonder Trickitt is not come yet; I have seen her almost
these two hours: But, Jesu! there is a Coach stopped; I hope it is hers


It Is my Lady Trickitt's; she is just Landed.


Landed! pray mind, Mr. Granger, how prettily he expresses it; he says she is
Landed


Proper, and apt indeed, were it out of a Kennel.


Su --


Trickit --

Dear, dear Creature!


Dear; dear Suky!


How the Monkies cling together!


Well, Trickitt, this was Barbarously done, I vow and swear now, neither to see
me, nor let me hear from thee in two whole hours: As I hope to breathe now, I
was just going to write thee a Scolding Letter


Nothing but Business, and my Lord's Commands could have prevented me.


Mr. Garnish, your Servant.


O, Mr. Garnish! you can tell us: Does Sir Symphony hold forth to Night?


He Will tell you himself immediately, Madam: I met him at the end of the Street;
and he told me, he had but five Visits to make in his way hither, and would be
with you in an Instant


Well, I vow, it is a Civil Gentleman.


You speak of him with some concern, Madam.


Who, I, Sir? no I vow, a filthy unmannerly Fellow,

And if he had not the Fiddles, now and then, would be good for nothing.

I abhor him, I vow I do: O law! what had I like to have done?


Your Ladyship, and Lady Trickitt design to be at his Music, I hope,
notwithstanding this aversion


What! on my day? Jesu! Mr. Granger, what do you take me for? Yet I love Music
to an extravagance, I vow now; but the World,Mr. Granger, what would the World
say


You're above their Censure, Madam: the received Opinion of your good breeding
will justify your Ladyship in any thing


Jesu! Trickitt, how Mr. Granger mistakes the matter?

It Is not that I fear to commit an error in good breeding,

Not I, I assure you; but if I should be so light, to go to public Places,
when all the World is sensible it is my day, they must needs think 'twere an
Assignation, and that for a Lady of my Quality --


Ladies, your most obeysant

Servant: I Am come to you with an invitation from the Muses; all the

World have promised me the honor of their Company; and yet if I am refused
your Ladyships, I shall think my House a Solitude


You can have no Company of mine to Night, Sir:

I must use him scurvily before Mr. Granger,

Else he may be jealous; and I would not have 'em quarrel here for the World.


Cruel Creature! But is there no hopes, Madam?


Nay, Sir, pray be quiet; Lord, cannot you let a body alone? pray what have I to
do with your hopes? Really, Mr. Granger, this Fellow is a forward impertinent
Fop, so he is


I hope, Madam, his forwardness does not proceed from any encouragement you
have given him


Jesu! Sir, I give a Man encouragement!


I only speak my Fears, Madam.


You're so Obliging, Sir --

Well, this is past dispute.


What have you there, Sir Symphony?


Why, this is a Catalogue of the Ladies
I Visit, Ogle, and say soft things to:
Seven and Fifty, Widows, Wives, and Maids:
And if I don't succeed with some of 'em;
I have been a Civil Person to little purpose.

I Will follow you immediately --


I Will take my time --


Madam, Mrs. Prattle has sent

Her servant, to desire your Ladyship to carry her to the Park to morrow Night.


How prettily the Child delivers his Message?

Pray kiss him, Mr. Granger, he has the sweetest breath; this will give an
opportunity to take off my Kiss, Granger
Child, you should make him a visit now and then;
But, Child, present my service to her, and beg her to pardon, or rather pity
my misfortune
For I have not one day free 'till Tuesday Sennight;
And then, if she pleases, she may Command me --
But hold, Child -- tell her, Trickitt and I intend to go to Shops, and see
Sights, all day long on Monday
Not one shall 'scape us, from the Fat Girl in St. Martin's-Lane, (Where we
intend to begin at Nine exactly) to the Embroidered Prince of Gilolo
If she is for a Frolic, Child, we shall be glad of her Company
This is a good hint for Mr. Granger, we shall be sure of him --
Well, don't you think Prattle has a world of Wit?

She Is a most Exquisite Lady, and one --


I did not ask your Opinion, Sir.


I find I am unfortunate to day, and will walk off with my disgrace, in hopes
of better times --


But your Opinion, Gentlemen, you are Judges.


She says a great deal, Madam --


And very well too, I vow, and swear now;

But what say you, Mr. Granger?


Faith, I think she is all talk, and no Company.


O law! Why she plays at little Games to a miracle.


The blind Horse is fittest for the Mill.


She Is a Lady of great Acquaintance.


Nay, she is the universal Crony of the Sex:

Not a Female from Thirteen, to Five and Thirty, can be a Week in Town, without
a Visit from her, which makes her very convenient to her Male Relations


O law! Mr. Granger! I vow I believe her as Virtuous as my self; but then she
Sings, and Plays upon the Virginals so sweetly, and Dances Country Dances


Nay, doubtless she has all her motions to a miracle; and for Joan Saunderson
--


O Law! Mr. Granger, you're so strangely S'terical:

I believe you laugh at us all behind our backs.


Fools I laugh at to their faces:

But such as your Ladyship --


O Jesu! Mr. Granger.


Wit, Beauty, and Good Breeding, Madam, command respect; 'twas Death to touch
the Ark


Well, he is strangely obliging! --

What, leaving us already, Mr. Gayman?


Business calls me from my pleasure, Madam.


I Am sure there is something in it --


Mr. Granger, you are melancholy, of the sudden,

Are not you well? will you have some of my Milk-water?


My Fever's in the Spirits, Madam.


Nay, there is something extraordinary;

We all observe a Change, Sir.


I Will lay my life, he is in Love, Child.


I hope he is, to be revenged of him;


Well, is it so, Mr. Granger?


In Company, like this, it is difficult to live without a Passion --


Well, this is a plain Declaration.
We must not force him to a Confession;
'Twill press his modestly too far, I vow now.

The Confession's but too plain;

Though she mistakes it.


Why so sullen, Sir?


Have I not Cause?


You mistake it, but I shall find a time.


I shall find it for you.


We interrupt the Ladies.

Let Us take the hint, and leave 'em --


O law! Gentlemen, I beg a Thousand Pardons --
What gone! Well, I Am so glad I have thee to my self:
Child, if Company comes, I have the Headache,
And am laid down --
I have a secret of prodigious Importance to tell thee;
Well, it is some Men's misfortune to judge amiss:
But what if Granger should be in Love?

Would that be an Error in his Judgment?


O law! you take me wrong:
But what if he should love a Friend of yours?
Well, I Will keep thee no longer in suspense;
He has a good Estate, besides his place,
And I Am confident you would not be against it.

What! a good Estate?


I Crimine! I see I must be plain with thee:

But did not you observe how Civil he was to me?


'Twas his good Breeding.


But from a Man, that is thought morose --


It Is a sign of a clear Sky;

No Clouds to raise the Spleen.


In short he loves me, and has even as good as told me so:

And I vow and swear I design to let him know his Passion is not unsuccessful:
I have a Plot upon him

My pretty little Iano shall visit him, as of himself, the Child shall give him
my Song, and tell him, all the Servants say, he is in Love with me, and that you
know will force a Declaration


No doubt, Child.


Well, we shall so laugh: And then you come to visit my Lady Susan Granger --
and then I return thy visit, and your Servant tells you, my Lady Susan
Granger's Page has sent up word, his Lady's just a landing from her Chair --
and then you say, your Ladyships, my Dear, is the prettyest Equipage in Town --
and then I say -- well I shall be so happy

For Mr. Granger resolves to eat in Plate.


Has he told you so?


Jesu! no; but then he laughs at all the Fools; And will bring me home the
Lampoons: But I must instruct the Child; come hither Iano: Prithee, md Dear,
pardon me a little


That my very good Friend should be so blind!
She Will be something long in her Instructions;
I Will into the Closet -- how! Suky!
A Man a sleep in thy Closet?

O law! I vow and swear now, it is my Nephew --
He was here before the Company came, and you know since our quarrel, his Wife
will not give him leave to come to me
Well, I wonder at her irregular fancy in Love, and Friendship: How can she
endure an antiquated Lofty, while there is a Youthful Gayman to be had? Or make
a Confidence with such a Creature, as Wishwell, that is past the taste of a
party quarre

Why my Lord, Lord Malepert.


O law! Aunt! what is the matter?

Why did you leave the Door unlockt?

I Am sure I made the back Door so fast, that Mrs. Iudy could not get in, for
all she had the Key: And I thought you had been old enough, to look to your
fore-dore your self. I Will swear, if I had thought you would serve me so, I
would have gone down the back Stairs, let the Footmen have said what they
please, so I would. But, good Madam, not a word of seeing me here


Well, trust you to my Discretion.


Nay, as for your Discretion, Madam, I know you:

You have Discretion enough to win all our Money, I Will take your word for any
thing but an Alpieu


Well, Dear Suky, adieu -- nay no ceremony --


O Jesu? can you be my Friend, and desire I should be so unbred --


You disoblige me eternally, if you stir a step farther.


To obey you, my Dear --

Well for all it is my day, Iudy and I will go masqued to Sir Symbony's --
Trickitt, Trickitt -- Gads me, I have forgot half my business with her -- I
must go in, and write her a Letter, before the Child comes back --


This is but an ill return, Mr. Granger, for she is a great admirer of yours.


Pox on her, she is so obliging; and takes such Pains to inform me, of what I
don't care to know


She calls you her dull Amintor, and says, for a well-bred Person, you are
certainly the most modest Creature breathing

She knows you're in Love with her, and has given you a 1000 opportunities, to
declare your Passion, which your respectfull bashfullness has still prevented
you, from laying hold of


From laying hold of! I am for laying hold of nothing, she has about her,
unless it be pretty Mrs. Iudy: No, no, she speaks too plain to be understood:
She may be in earnest, upon this Subject, to her self; but she will always be a
jest to me. Not but I shall put her to the right use


Not the use you think of, if I can help it.


What Is the business?


Sir, my Lady Susan Malepert's little Page is below, and says he comes to make
your Honor a visit


Bring him up:

Does she send her Ambassador already?

She has scarce had time to draw up his Credentials: Prithee step into my
Dressing Room, while I give audience

My little Ganymede!

You Are welcome; this was kindly done.


But if you should tell my Lady, she would never forgive me.


How do you know, Child?


She told me so; for she knows nothing of my coming.


Indeed Child?


No indeed now: Nay, and if you should tell her, I say she talks kindly of you;
she would kill me, so she would


No sure, Child, she could not have the heart.


Yes indeed, she bad me say so: And then I must not give you this Song, unless
you promise to give't me again; for she said a fine Lady of Quality writ it,
upon a very good Friend of yours


But I may take a Copy?


She said nothing of that, I believe you may.


When will Lady Trickitt be with your Lady, Child?


She Is with her two or three times every day:
And then the Servants say your Honor loves my Lady, and intend to
Marry her, and be our Master.

That were too great an Honor for me, Child: Does not Lady Trickitt send for
thee sometimes to sing to her


I go there by and by: But my Lady will be so impatient to know what your
Honor says; for indeed she does not know a word of my being here


That Is a good Child: But thy Lady's a fine, accomplished Lady; I dare not
presume to think of her. But here is the Song again; my Friend shall write an
Answer


And shall I tell my Lady so from your Honor?


She knows nothing of the matter, Child: But there is a Guiney. to buy Cherries,
and be sure you call on my Lady Trickitt, in your way home, and give her this:
And if you bring me an Answer, I have another, Guiney in my Pocket for you: So,
that is my good Child, thy Lady will want thee


Well, Sir, what News from the Lady?


Nothing extraordinary; she has played the Fool, and writ a Song, as most
People do, that are in love: Pray read it, it is all her own, I assure you


PRithee, my Dear, do not be so peevish
To her, that takes thy part:
Although thy Eyes, and thy Tongue so theevish,
Have stole away her Heart.
For know, my Dear, it is I that love thee,
Most Passionately:
And if thou't do as it does behove thee,
I Will thank thee heartily.
Then, prithee Dear, let me know the Morning,
When thou and I shall Wed:
For I, by that, shall guess the Evening
When we shall go to Bed.
Tender and Passionate! and a very just Conclusion!


Shall we look into the Play?


I Will wait on you --

Till I know the Success of your Letter.


Once I lay with another Man's Wife,
And I lay in a great deal of danger:
But now I have gotten a Wife of my own. --

And so I have, by Pompey; and here must I, to get a solitary Guiney, now and
then, to keep up Loyalty, with a Cup of Cordial Nants, be forced to see a
Parcel of Ague-fac'd Puppies come perking and pruning after my damned Jade: Pox
on her, cannot she sell off all her Foolish Trumpery at once, and set up an
honest Sociable Cellar, where a gang of Generous, Old, Crimson-gill'd,
grumbling Cavaliers, may take a Pipe and a Quartern, and my Honor never be
concerned

Nay, prithee, good Captain, the Company will be here in a wink, as a body may
say: Cannot you go take a civil walk in our Fields, and leave me to carry on my
Occupation


Occupation, with a Pox to you! What, must I be turned out from under my own
Roof, to make Room for a Company of strutting, cocking Coxcombs? To help to
carry on your Occupation! Ounds! I Will not stir a foot: I Will see who dares
command, where I am Master, I will, by Pompey


But pray consider, Captain --


That Is good, I gad, talk of Consideration to a Captain: Why do not thou know
that I have been undone for three Kings, without any Consideration? Why I have not
one single Tester left to purchase a civil Qaartern: And how should I consider,
with a Pox to you


Consider this then, Captain --


Ay, this is sense now; this I can consider: And prithee, Dolly, do thou
consider too; for Honor, thou know, is the nearest and dearest thing to a
Soldier: So prithee carry thy self like the Wife of my Bosom: For, look thee,
Child, it is not any concern for thy Carcass that makes me speak --


Thank you, good Captain.


No, by Pompey, it is my Honor; and look to it, you had best, for I may return
most rouzie-bouzie, and if I find you have injured me, I Will swinge you all, by
Hercules


So get thee gone.

Betty, is the China carried to my Lady Trickitt's?


The Fellow's come back, Madam.


Has he brought the Money?


No, she bid him call next Week.


Gads bodikins! had not she promised me ready Money, I had never parted with my
Goods: Well, there is no faith in these upstart great Ladies: Now must I make
forty jaunts to the other end of the Town; and then I shall be paid in cracked
Money; and pay Poundage into the Bargain


She said you were obliged to her for the Custom of the Court, and owed her a
good turn


And she thinks to put me off with the Court-Custom; that is good, in faith; and
I must afford her my Ware for nothing: Where Is the Heart set with Diamonds I
mist this Morning


We have searched high and low, but to no purpose.


Then I suspect my Lady Sinker took it.


Suspect! Why, she is famous for it all the Town over.


Nay, that may very well be: For, to my knowledge, greater Ladies have been
taken in the manner: But she shall not carry it off so

I did not expect your Ladyship this half hour: Betty, set on the Tea-Water.


We had a mind to chat by our selves; prithee shut the Door, that we may be
private


I swear I Am in Mortal apprehensions: My Lord Lofty has my Secret, and I know
him capable of any thing, to be revenged of me


What can he do? he is disgraced at Court: And if he rails now, no body will
believe him


Ay, but he knows --


What does he know? he knows you're a Woman.


Lord! you know where I have a Mulberry spot --


Is that all: he bribed it from your Woman.


Well, I Will do what I can to prevent his being believed; carry it civilly to
him, and speak better of him than ever


So will the Town believe you but an honest Jilt at worst.


But this Sir Ruff is such a blustering half-witted Coxcomb!


If he had less wit, he were never the worse for us: But a thousand Pound, my
Dear


My Mistress bid me tell your Ladyship, Mr. Gayman's within, and has made up
the number of the Raffle


We Are a little busy yet, but shall be glad of his Company --


She Is not displeased at his being here --

This Gayman is not for our turn, Child; he is an Observer; besides, though he
loves his Pleasure, he swears he will not pay for it, till past forty -- Here Is
Maria


The Chair must wait --


Send away thy Chair, Child; thou shall go home with us. We have Bassett this
Evening


I Will but pay it off, and return in a Moment.


That Is a pretense: 'Twas Gayman sent for her. He has so great a Friendship for
her, that, contrary to the principles of a well-bred Man, he has ventured to
give her good advice, and, I believe, warned her of our Company


I tax't her of it,

But she denied it.


She Is discreet, and has but one Weakness, immoderate love of Play --


And love of me: I can make her do any thing --


But one, my Dear: She Is Virtuous.


For that I keep her Company --


And for her Money: For, to my knowledge, you have won above 600 l. of her at
Comet


Not so much at Comet; but more at all Games.


The Company is all within, my Lord, Mr. Gayman, and Sir Ruff -- they are but
looking on some Stuffs; if you're at leisure --


My Lord, shall not we have your Company?


Indeed, my Dear, I did


Drawers, my Lord, you mean.


Jesu! no; you know, I never wear Linings.


Shall we Raffle?


I must drink some Tea first --

Siam, is the Tea ready?


It Is just put in -- Good Lord! I wonder you will go so, so like a Sloven: Here Is
a Periwigg well combed; and a Cravat sits finely, to appear in Ladies Company


Very well, Mrs. Siam; but had not you Twins 6 Months after you were Married?
Tho


No, Limberham; nor will you get half a one, in 6 Years after you are Married.


I wonder, Ladies, any body will buy of Mrs. Siam.

Mrs. Bantam's things are ten times better.


Ten times dearer, and ten times worse, I faith:

What! Lord Tattletale, you told her, I said, she was a Papist.


And she said you were an Atheist, And believed in nothing but Scotch-Divinity.


And what do you believe in?
Nothing but a Favorite, or Sir Faeminine,
That old Woman in Man's Clothes --

He swears you're a Bawd Mrs. Siam. --


Not to him, nor his Neeces, in good faith.


Why, why, pray?


Why, he has no use for one; and they need none:

Lord help your Head; come drink your Tea.


Already in Council!


What Madam Wishwell has told your Ladyship, you may depend upon:

I am a Man of Honor, and your humble Servant, Madam.


My Lady believes you, Sir Ruff: To Night at Twelve;

You know the Garden-Door.


My happiness is so amazing!


Contain your self: We are observed:

What! drinking Tea, my Lord?


Yes, if Siam would give me a little Sugar;

I love sweet things mightily.


Yes, too much for a Wit:

There; it is Syrrup for you --


Prithee, Siam, fill me some Tea.


O law! he has scauld me to Death.


Pough! 'twas almost cold:

And Tea, you know, never burns.


Jesu! and what a pickle am I in!


Here Is a do with a drop of Water!

Come, let me rub you down, Tom dingle --


Ounds! what is this? Kissing your Cockrill before my face! by Pompey! who am I?
I Will pepper you, you and your young Urchin too; I will by Pompey


O Law! Captain, but hear Reason:

Now as I hope for marssy, there was no harm.


Ounds! that is a good one:

No harm to kiss my Dolly?


Nay, take my word for it, Captain,

You need not fear when I am by.


Why, look you, you may be as little concerned

For your Puppy, as you please, Madam:

But for my damned --


Nay, prithee, Numpee, don't disturb the Company; they were going to Raffle.


Yes, by Pompey, you were a Raffling:

I caught you at it, a Raffling for my Honor, with a Pox to you.


No, faith, Captain, we shall Raffle for a better thing.


Ounds! Sir, what is that you say?


Why, I say, what we Raffle for, is of Threescore Pound value: Say nothing, and
you go to twelve with me


Say thou so, Old Boy? It Is so like Speering's,

That for once I am contented.


Come then, shall we Raffle?


Here Is the Box, Ladies.


Two Cinques, and a Quater!


That Is Fifteen.


Exactly, my Lord; Four and Ten.


O law! no; Fourteen.


And Thirteen, is Seven and Twenty

And Eighteen.


No, two Sixes, and an Ace.


Well, that is Forty --


Confederacy! did not you observe

Wishwell turn over one of your Dice?


'Twas by chance, playing with her Fan.


You're sincere your self,

And believe every body so, but me.


Dam these Dice --


Before the Ladies, Sir Ruff?


But I always lose, when I play fair.


Come, now for my Fortune --


Madam, I have some Doctors in my Pocket,

If you please to use 'em.


What Doctors, Sir?


Why, don't you know the Doctors?

The Dice that only run the high Chances.

I Will put 'em into your Box, and no body the wiser.


You should have don't without telling me.


So I can still, Madam --

I stand cross-legg'd for you, Madam --

Vigorously done, Madam --


I have lost it.


I despair of winning -- it is yours --


Ounds! I go to twelve with you --


Come, throw, Sir --


It Is mine with much ado.


A hard World, Faith, and Troth;

But I brought luck along with me.


I remember you, Captain.


Sir, Sir Symphony, and his Instruments, are at the Door, in half a dozen
Coaches, and stay for you


Adso, where is my Gittern?


Why, Numpee, you broke your Gittern, you know.


My Gittern! moldy Chops! where were you bred I trow? But my Neighbor Twingle
the Barber has one, I Will borrow it so long from his Customers


Did you hear of the foolish Accident befell Sir Symphony?


What was it, my Lord?


Why, Serenading, the other Night,
His Gittar, and he, fell into a Cellar,
And like to break both their Necks.

What say you to a Pooile at Comet,

At my House?


Sir Ruff, Will you make one?


I am always devoted.


Ladies, shall not I be troublesome?


The Devil take him.


We shall be glad of your Company.


Well, I Will go before in a Hackney,

And get things ready for you: I find,

I must show you the way --


Well said, my Lord, you in the Front appear: And I may help you to bring up
the Rear


WEll, how do you like Sir Ruff? he is a little mutinous at my wit sometimes;
but he is good natured; and then has the Sense, and Courage of a Lion: But the
Barronet's Worship may pass for a Squire at Comet though


One would almost swear he loses on purpose, to my Lady.


Why so one would, I vow now, if one did not know the Company.

Well, I swear now, Mrs. Wishwell, you look so young,

You are not above five and Twenty, are you?


Nay, if you're witty upon your Friends, I have done with you.


Prithee now, I will not be witty again these two hours.


For once I Will take your word.

Well, my Lord, you're happy in a good Lady;

She Is as discreet, as she is handsome.


You know a well-bred Man must not think too well of his own Wife: But I vow
now, before I was Married, I thought her as handsome as an Angel


My Lord Lofty has not been here of late.


He would hardly bow to me at the Play, last Night;

But I thought he was out of humor for being turned out; and yet I vow I had
no hand in it


For being turned out of this House I believe.


O law! why I carried it the civilest to him in the World.


But he desired your Lady should be civil to him.


And so she was, I hope: Why, I have known her alone with him, in her Closet,
when she was denied to every body else


While she thought him a Man of Honor,

For your sake she suffered him.


Have a care what you say,

I Am told, he is likely to be greater than ever.


But must not with your Lady.


Ay, but he must tho: I have not got the Patent he promised me.


And he is to give you a new Crest to your new Coronet?


No, really, I like mine very well: The Golden-Calf has been the Crest of our
Family, ever since the Conquest


The Horns will grow in time.

Dull Man!

He has made Love to your Lady.


Jesu! that is pleasant! A Statesman make Love! why, he can no more deal with a
Mistress, than with a House of Commons


Come leave your fooling; and promise me, not to quarrel with him; you shall
promise me, for you are so nice in points of Honor I know


Honor! Lord help your Head (as Siam says) I have as much

Honor as I care for; I am a Lord;

And shall hardly quarrel to get more.


But you must promise me then, to take no notice of it to my Lady: she would never
forgive what I tell you; out of the respect I have for you both


Nay, I vow I Am mightily obliged to you; and so is my Wife; though the Jesters in
the Dancing-Room are apt to laugh at me, when I tell 'em so. But had he the
Impudence to make Love to her


Ay, more than so, he surpised her one day, in her Closet, and would have
ravished her


O law! I did not think a Man of Fifty could ravish --


Had not her Virtue, and my seasonable assistance prevented him: But I found
her just fallen into a swoon


How! fallen into a swoon! nay then he might ravish her:

But tho I say it, that should not say it, there are some of our Family (though
they cannot ravish as well as he) should they know this, were he ten times my
Lord Lofty -- I Will do it my self --


Nay, remember what you promised me.


No matter for that, I Will about it instantly.


For Heaven's sake, you will not Murder him.


No, that is the way to hang for it:

I Will complain to the King --


And make your self and Family Ridiculous:
It Is enough your Lady's Virtuous, and you know it.
But, what if this base Man should brag of Favors?

Ay, but what signifies our Wives Virtue, if they are so liable to fall into a
swoon? Any Woman may be taken napping you know


But, if this base Man should brag of Favors?


Why, let him brag; he is out of favor at Court; and whatever he says now goes
for nothing in the Drawing Room; and I care not this what he can say any where
else; for I would not be known by my good will out of the Verge of White Hall


Or if some of your pretended Friends, should go about to make you suspect me.


Though I should surprise 'em in the manner, and you standing Centry --


My Lady's here --


How! Wishwell! I protest I don't understand this:

Indeed my Lord I shall be jealouse of you.


But shall I never be jealous of you, my Lady.


You need not, Dear, knowing your self so well:

If I were wantonly inclined, where could I mend my self.


Where am I? sure Paradise is round me:

To touch thee's Heaven, but to enjoy thee! Oh! --


Have my Lord and you been at the Cordial Waters?


We have been gravely talking of the deceit, and wickedness of the Age, Madam.


I understand you --

My Lord when shall we into the Country? I Am quite weary of this Town: The
Company and public diversions carry you so much abroad, I languish days
without you: There I should be oftener blessed


Well, Dear, I vow now, I will not be a moment from you, but when I Am in other
Company: But that it is not the fashion to be fond of ones Wife, I verily
believe I could say a great many soft things to her


Pray, my Dear, let us go to Monkey-Hill.


O law! what should I do in the Country?
There Is no Levees, no Mall, no Plays, no Operas,
No Tea at Siam's no Hide-Park, no Musick-meetings,
No Basset, no Drawing Room, no Masquerades,
Nor no Hackney-Coaches to run about in;
And you know I love running about mightily.

Nor, no body that understands good breeding.


There the Justice's Lady comes to visit, and ask questions after the fashion:
And how do they wear their Hair? Do they carry their Heads as high as they did
last Easter Term


And, Lord! is such a one as wicked as she was in the last Lampoon? We have no
such Creatures in the Country, I assure you


And then if I talk Wit, or banter Mr. Justice about State Affairs, he stares
at me, and does not understand me: Unless one laughs ones self, the jests are
lost upon 'em


Well, well, there are a Thousand innocent Diversions --


What! Angling for Gudgeons, Bowls, and Ninepins?


More wholesome, and diverting, than always the duste MillHorse driving in
Hide-Park


O law! don't profane Hide-Park: Is there any thing so pleasant as to go there
alone, and find fault with the Company? Why there cannot a Horse, or a Livery
escape a Man, that has a mind to be witty: And then I sell bargains to the
Orange-Women


If you loved, as I do, you would like the Country; there I should have you
Weeks together; you might sit by, and see me work; or read a Play or a Novel to
me


Lord! you know, if I read three Minutes together,

I fall asleep: And then if I should chance to be alone, what would become of
me? I never think, but it puts me into the Spleen, I Am ready to cry


Now if you have over-acted your part, and he should go into the Country.


I know him too well for that.


Well, Madam, adieu --


Jesu! whither now?


I Will be at home time enough to go to Bed with you:

But Sir Barnaby Banter, Captain Tilter, and Sir Cantaver Bawwaw stay in the
side Box for me


I wonder you will leave me for such Coxcombs.


O law! Coxcombs! have a care what you say:

Banter has a World of Wit: He drove my Chariot a whole Evening at Hide-Park,
in my Coachman's Periwigg, and Livery: I swear he drives as well as any
Gentleman in England: I wonder where he learnt it


It may be natural to him; his Father kept a Coachman.


Then Sir Cantaver Bawwaw -- I wish you had been with us the other Night -- we
had a Country Cudden with us; he played upon him all Night; I warrant you, he
dumfounded him a hundred times


Indeed!


Aye, and once, when I was bantering the Squire What do you think? He put some
Gunpowder uner his Chair, and blew him up


And did the Squire take it?


At the first he was a little angry; But we all swore 'twas a Squibb thrown
into the Window: Then Captain Tilter he came souse upon him indeed, and threw a
whole Glass of Clarret in his face


And could you swear off that too?


No truly, the Put plucked up a Spirit, struck Tilter, and Challenged him to go
down with him; now the Captain begged his pardon, because he would not spoil
Company; but winkt, and laughed upon us all the while, for we were in the
Secret you know -- but I must go to 'em, or they will laugh at me; and swear I Am
under Correction; and that a Body would not have every one know neither, you
know


So, he is safe for this Night.


How can we trust to that?


Pray trust to me: I had him sent for; and will pretend to lie with you: Should
my Lord come home, we are gone to Bed; besides, you have bred him up to lie in
his Dressing Room, upon these occasions


Well, if it must be so: For your sake I can do any thing.


And something for your own: There Is Money, that is certain: And for any other
Disappointment, you may bear it the better from a Man you don't like: We must
not always please our selves, Child


Sir Ruff, Sir Ruff! you overlook your Friends.


It must be a very good Friend, I don't overlook at this time.


Why, what is the matter?


Why, I Am an Emperor, and this the Night of my Coronation; Know, Friend, for
thou art the only Confident of my Pleasures, that this Night, at Twelve, the
Incomparable Madam Wishwell receives me at my Lady's Garden-Door: This being
told, I must be gone: For nothing but the pleasure of imparting to my
Bosom-Friend, could detain me a Moment


But where is the haste now?


The haste! Why they may be at the Music, for ought I know: And if I should
not be there to receive 'em: Where Is the haste now


Be Crowned to Night, do you say? No, no, I Will spoil his Holiday.


What, Gayman thoughtful?


I have it in my head, But you must help me out with it.


Mr. Granger --


Well said, my Mercury!


Here Is an Answer to your Letter, Sir,

But I must not be seen here, lest my Lady should be known to be within in a
Masque; and that she would not for any thing: She says, Sir, you must not know
her


But what said my Lady Trickit?


Indeed, Sir, I dare not stay any longer.


There Is thy Guiney, Child.


A Lady's Trophy, Mr. Granger?


A Forerunner of dark Deeds; you shall hear it.


I Am glad you're Converted; and will not fail to be at Rosamond' s Pond, at Ten
exactly, where I will use my best Endeavors to Confirm you

A very Pious Gentlewoman, this!


She Would make an admirable Missionary For China, or the Mogul's Country.


Mine Is a tender Conscience, and requires extraordinary, helps.


Methinks you're something frank of the Lady's Secrets.


O Sir, they allow all Freedoms to us, who are able to discover their good
Qualities, as well as their Intrigues


There Is no Man hindered from telling, but he that enters no farther into the
Secret

Besides ours are Sworn Mistresses: And the more

We set out their Perfections, the more their Renown.


Nay, mine is a very Sun-Flower:
When e're the Golden God but shows his Head,
She opens presently.

Fie, fie, I shall lose my Reputation with you.


You! why with all your Prudence, of never bowing to your Mistress in a public
place, stealing glances under your Hat, and following her at a sly distance in
the Mall, you are found out as well as we, who make no Mystery of the matter


Nay, sooner; for your Gravity is suspected of a design, while the franker
Fellows have not Credit enough with the Town to establish a Scandal


But a little Discretion does no harm.


Discretion! why that is enough to ruin a Man, with the whole Sex: He that has
lived to twenty, without the Reputation of a wicked Fellow; will never be
allowed to be wicked in a fashionable Company as long as he lives


You're only for the Brutal part, Gentlemen.


I don't know what you mean by the Brutal part:

Mine Is a healthy Constitution; it ebbs, and flows, like the Sea, and needs
nothing but it self; to cause its motion


There Is part of Sir Symphony's

Eguipage, it is time to follow --


At Ten a Clock! I shall watch you, Mr. Granger.


Who Is there? What would you have?


Is Mr. Scrapewell within?


No, you may find him at the Bear.


Tell Sir Symphony here are some Gentlemen desire the favor to come in.


Lord, Sir, I cannot let you in:

Here Is scarce room already, for the Gentlemen

Performers, to stir their Elbows --

Well, what is the matter now?


Sir, here is Mr. Humdrum's Base-Viol --


Give it me.


Here are Ladies.


The Ladies must come in.


O law! yonder he is talking to other Ladies.
But that is because I was not here:
Yet he is not to know I am here;
Though I hope my little Iano has told him.

It Is so --
Thus by the hobble in her Pace,
AEneas knew his Mother's Grace.
Now will I be a very Obedient Lover,
And not know her.

Ounds! this may be my -- No, no, it is not she.


Ladies, you're very welcome: Chairs there.

Would you would unmask, and join the Arms of your Beauty, to the force of the
Music, that not a Heart might escape


I know, Sir, you are too well bred,

Not to give us our liberty,


This Place is Sacred to the Fair,

You must Command, Ladies.


Knight, is your Noctural here?

Are they good Goods, I must examine.


O Jesu! this rude Fellow!


Sir, you may talk till the Music plays, But here you must excuse me,

I suffer no Ruffling. --


Zounds! Sir, I Will excuse neither them, nor you,

For all your scraping.


This must be improved to a Quarrel.

Hark you, Sir Ruff --


Zounds! Sir, I Will protect the Damsels, as much as any Man.


Ay, Sir Ruff, get the rude Fool beaten,

That would affront 'em, do.


O Jesu! Mr. Granger, protect me,

I Am ready to dye.


There Is no danger, Madam.


Pray lead me to a Chair, I tremble every joint of me;

I shall fall into a Fit.


'Twou'd break Sir Symphony's Heart, Madam.


O Law! I hope you don't know me;

I protest I would not be known for the World.


I only guess your Quality: by your air.


But why do you tax me for Sir Symphony?

I swear, Sir, I value no body more than your self:

But, I vow, you have obliged me extremely --


All Discords! Fourths, and Sevenths! Gentlemen.

Would that Ear of yours were reformed once --


In a Pillory?


Come, come, let us Tune, we make the Ladies stay.


He takes a Base-Viol, and while he is Tuning, one of the Bullies unwinds the
Pegs over his head: Then he lays down the Bow, which the Bully draws through
the Candle; when Sir Symphony tries to play, he cannot make it sound

Lord! Gentlemen, it is impossible to Play at this rate:

Standing so near me, as you do, your Breath has so moistened my Strings, they
will not sound


Dam me Tom, the Knight Crowds most splendidly: I Will banter him: Pray, Sir,
when you lengthen a Crotchet into Quavers, and divide it by Minums, does not
your Cravat-String deaden the sound of your Fiddle


Mine Is a Cremona, and cost me 50 Pounds, Gentlemen,

Pray suspend your Curiosity, and come to my Chamber,

And I Will resolve you any Question in Music.


But, Sir, if the volatile parts of Music should justle with the effluviums of
the Air

For Tico Brache holds, all sounds go in a right line by undulation: Can common
time be consistent with a Jigg


Lord, Sir, you make such a noise -- I make all my Jiggs in common time; are
you satisfied


But if Harmony was first discovered, by the beating of Hammers upon an Anvil;
why should not your Head make the most melodious, Instrument

For Aristotle holds that your hollow Vessels --


If you're for a Cockpit, so --

Come, pray let us begin --


O Gad! there is a flat Note!
There Is Art! How surprizingly the Key changes!
O law! there is a double relish! I swear, Sir, you have the sweetest little
Finger in England! ha! that stroak's new; I tremble every inch of me
Now Ladies look to your Hearts --
Softly, Gentlemen -- remember the Echo --
Captain, you play the wrong Tune -- O law! my Teeth! my Teeth! for God's sake,
Captain, mind your Cittern -- Now the Fuga, bases! again, again! Lord! Mr.
Humdrum, you come in three bars too soon
Come, now the Song --

Though you make no return to my Passion,
Still I presume to Adore:
'Tu in Love but an odd Reputation,
Faintly repulsed to give over:
When you talk of your Duty,
I gaze on your Beauty,
Nor mind the dull Maxim at all;
Let it Reign in Cheapside,
With the Citizen's Bride,
It will never be received in Whitehall.
What Apocryphal Tales are you told?
By one, who would make you believe.
That, because of to have, and to hold,
You still must be Pinned to his Sleeve:
It Is apparent High Treason,
Against Love, and Reason,
Should one such a Treasure engross,
He that knows not the Ioys,
That attend such a Choice,
Should resign to another who does.
NO, no, no, no, Resistance is but vain,
And only adds new weight to Cupid's Chain:
A Thousand Ways, a Thousand Arts,
The Tyrant knows to Captivate our Hearts:
Sometimes he Sighs imploys, and sometimes tries
The Universal Language of the Eyes:
The Fierce, with Fierceness he destroys:
The Weak with Tenderness decoys.
He kills the Strong with Joy, the Weak with Pain:
No, no, no, no, Resistance is but vain.
This is admirable: But if you would oblige the Ladies, you must play your Solo.


With all my Heart, if the Captain will accompany,


Pox a' this scraping, and tooting:

Shall we Eclipse, Tom, and make it a Rankum?


No, no, we'll dumfound the Baronet.


Who Is that? What do you mean?

This is not to be born:

Is It you, take that, Sir.


This is a common Cause.


They draw, drive the Bullies out, the Women run out at the other door, Sir
Ruff retires to a Corner of the Stage, and draws, the others return --

These Brutes have almost destroyed all the public Diversions of the Town.


Stand you by Sir Symphony,

I Will bring him a Challenge --

I Have always thought you brave, Sir Ruff.


Why, who dares think otherwise?


I believe Sir Symphony will meet you.


Or I Will post him: But what has he done?


Softly -- You designed it, I suppose; and your best way is to be before hand
with him, I Will stand by you --


Why I saw him; he encouraged 'em: Besides, Fidler's but a scurvy Title for a
Knight


Why did he call me Fiddler?


He said you were a wretched scraper,

Only fit to play to a Garland upon a May Day:

My Lady Susan heard him, as well as I.


Nay if one were sure of that, if she heard him:

One would not do a foolish thing, hand over head, without Reason, you know.


If you bring it to any thing, let me serve you?

You shall find me at my Lodgings --


Well then, desire him to meet me, with his Sword in his Hand, to morrow
morning


If he finds you so backward, he will never ask your pardon.


But to Night I have Business, you know.


Greater than your Honor?


It Is very unfortunate -- But use your pleasure.


Sir, I hope you will pardon my Message.

Sir Ruff desires you would meet him, with your Second, in Moorfields.


I was just designing to send to him, to meet me, to morrow morning.


He desires it may be to Night, Sir.


To Night?


At twelve: The Moon shines very clear:

At Bedlam Gate, at twelve, Sir --


I must send to Mr. Granger: I shall not fail, Sir. --


Come, Sir, I have business for an Hour; but get you ready, you need not make
your Will, I believe; I Will meet you at the Sun Tavern behind the Change, and
not fail -- to disappoint you of your Seconds


Let the Woman deserve as little as her Man, she seldom fails of a favorable
opinion of her own Charms; and, in the Intrigue, if it be possible, will be the
greater Fool of the two. Because I like Trickit, she thinks I Am in love with
her: Why, how has she the impudence to think so! But she does think so; for in
this Note, she has promised to meet me here: If she has Honesty enough to be as
good as her Word; she needs no greater Curse: There was no occasion of my
knowing that she can make her Husband a Cuckold, to make me have an ill opinion
of her: I always thought so ill of her that it is now necessary to think a
little while well, to think worse of her than I did: That must be my reason of
liking her; a malicious Pleasure of revenging the Quarrel of those Fools (not
forgetting her dear Lord) who have trusted, and been deceived by her, She cannot
deceive me

Whom have we here? a Sister in Affliction!

If my Nymph, and her Shepherd have strayed together: 'Twere a gentle Charity,
of my side, to propose a Club of Inconstancy for a Revenge

Mr. Granger! is it you?


The best part of him, Madam.


O law! Mr. Granger! I fear I have tired your Patience: An impertinent
Kinswoman popt in upon me, and kept me above half an hour, I vow now


A trick upon me! but I Will fit her.

I thought the Minutes Ages, till you came.


O Jesu! and did you, dear Mr. Granger?


By her, O Jesu, I guess the Party --

Madam, this Happiness attones for all.


O Jesu! But can you love me dearly?


More than Heaven.


And you will be constant?


As Penelope.


And you will love me for ever and ever?


Amen, to the end of the Chapter.


You Will swear all this?


The Bible through, Madam: By your fair self, by all --


Hold, hold, good Sir, enough: Well, we shall be so happy; but when? for now
you may command me


Now, Madam, this instant --


O Jesu! what do you mean:


To let you know how well I love you.


No, I vow, I would not for all the World: As I hope for Massy, you must hate
me, to offer this


Rather if I should not offer it, Madam;

The opportunity, and you are kind --


O law! Sir! if you will be honorable --


There Shades are honorable: You are not the first Woman has trusted her
Honor with 'em: Keep your own Counsel, and they will tell no Tales to your
Relations, to put you out of Countenance, as you walk barefaced this way with
'em


But this to a Lady of my Quality.


Why, 'twere a downright flight upon you, not to offer to be civil to you: And
a Woman of Quality can bear any thing better than a slight, you know: Besides,
the Place, and Hour take all distinction off: Come, come, you have made as
decent a resistance, as is necesary to excuse you to your Quality


Well, Mr. Granger, I thought'you had more respect for me, else I should never
have trusted my self with you, alone; in the Honorable way of Marriage, I own
I could receive you


Why, you are married already.


O Crimine! No; who do you take me for?


Nay, if you're not married, you must tell me.


Pray, who did you visit this Afternoon?


A Worthy, Grave Lady, Lady Susan Malepert.


Suppose it her you talk to.


Suppose you her! suppose my Lady Susan with a Man, alone, at ten at Night, and
in this place too! No, no, that is not to be supposed; and you are no better
than you should be, to offer it: If you were not in Petticoats, you should know
how I resent a wrong so great to her I so much honor


Why then, I vow now --


Nay, never load your Crime with Perjury.


Why, dear Sir, did not you appoint this place?


But that Lady does not use to answer Appointments.


And would you make my generous Pity appear a Crime?


For the generous Pity you speak of, I would have you to know, that Lady has
none for any Man, at Rosamond's Pond


O Jesu! Sir! Why sure it is no Crime, in an Honorable way, to see the Man one
loves


Love! why that is a Folly Lady Susan has renounced these twenty Years: Her
Pulse beats even, and her sober Blood runs quiet in her Veins: And as for
Matrimony, I know the very Name would frighten her: Besides I dare not aim so
high


O Jesu! Your Merit equals you to all things: And were I ten times what I am --


Thou art a thing I must despise; a Midnight Stroaler; nay worse, some
mischief-making Fiend, who would assume the Title of an Angel, to be the more
a Devil. Bless me! methinks I see the cloven Foot peep under her Petticoat!
Defend me! I say, and deliver me from such Company


Jesu! What can this mean? Either he did not, or he would not know me: If he
did not hope to meet me here, why did he write to me? he had my Letter, else
why came he hither? but then he said I was married O law! may be he suspected
Sir Symphony: Well, I must forbid him my Lodgings, I see that, to convince him.
O law! but then he would have been so rude! but that might be to try my Virtue;
for I must needs say, he spoke all the while of me with the greatest respect in
the World. Well, I love him, that is certain, and must not lose him; I Will be
plain with him the first time I see him; for marry him I must, and wear my
Wedding Ring upon my Thumb too, that I Am resolved on


This is some sort of Revenge upon the Rogue for refusing me his Money: How
could he imagine I would allow him a favor, when he had given me such a reason
to believe he did not think it worth paying for? I would carry my malice
farther, to punish his impudence in writing to me; but since his Note has
contributed to the cheating him with the Person of Lady Susan; I am at the end
of my design; and am contented only to laugh at him --


Rest you merry, Madam.


They may laugh that win, they say, Mr. Garnish.


And Ladies seldom lose in such a Town as this is, where there are so many
civil Persons to play at your own Game too


But how came you here at such a time?


Madam, I cannot be so indifferent a Lover, not to watch the Motions of your
inclinations; finding your pleasure lie this Evening in the Park, I came to
find it out


Indeed if you had come a little sooner, you might have found it: I have been
very well pleased since I came here


I believe so.


But you come a little too late to be a Witness of it; the business is over.


O Madam, I would not disturb you, if the business had not been over: I met Mr.
Granger, Madam, and knew hy him the business was over


And what said he to you? did not he look like an Ass?


As Men generally do upon such occasions: But I thought it unreasonable to tell
him, he looked like an Ass, because I knew he was not the first of your making


Mr. Garnish!


I Am sure you have made an Ass of me: But my Jealousy has restored my Eyes;
and now I plainly see you would abuse me. When Granger sent you the Note of
Assignation, I was with hi


Well, I received one from him --


O! did you so?


By Lady Susan's Page.


By the same Token he gave the Boy a Guiney to encourage so hopeful a
beginning; and told him, if he brought him an answer, he had another to set him
up in his Trade: You were not wanting on your party, I know


Why, truly, no; when I read it, I put it into another cover, and gave it the
Page to carry his Lady: She was glad of the Appointment, I suppose, sent him an
Answer, and came according to the Invitation


And what did you come for?


To laugh at the mistake --


And set him right. O, very probable!


It Is very true,


That you are very false.


I never was false to you.


Away, away, it is not to be excused.


I don't excuse it.


No, no, it never can.


Why then it never shall; and I am sorry I attempted it: If you don't think it
worth your while to be satisfied, I Am sure I was in the wrong to endeavor it.
Sir, as I remember, matters between you and me are entirely depending upon our
good liking and pleasure: It Is not in the nature of an Amor to make one
another uneasy: When once we begin to find faults, it is high time to find out
fresh Friends, that have none: The severest Jealousy of this kind, lies within
the Remedy of parting


It need not come to that neither, Madam.


Sir; I will not be suspected, I will not be enquired into: A Husband can do no more;
and I have enough of one Husband and his ill humors at home, I thank you, ever
to allow of a Husband abroad to torment me. Perhaps you think I cannot break
with you; I would have you to know, Sir, I can, and will break with you and
fifty more, rather than break one hours rest for any of you. I Will change as
often as I shift my Clothes, but I Will light upon a Man that has sense enough to
value his own pleasure, without invading mine. If I depended upon you indeed,
and there were no body else to be had, you might tie me to your own terms, but,
make us thankful, there is roving room enough in this dear Town: I can provide
my self, I warrant you

A Mistress is a name implies Command:

Nor shall the Scepter fail within my Hand:

But if you would take back that Power you gave,

Marry the Woman you would make a Slave.


Lord Malepert' s House.

O what a Night was that! how soft the Bed,
When on her panting Bosom I was laid!
Warm in Enjoyment, we together grew,
And as one Mind, were but one Body too --
How, how? one Mind! no, there I Am out: now cannot I help thinking of Sir Ruff,
and destroying the Memory of this Night's Pleasures, by calling to mind they
were all designed for another. Cannot I be contented with the Enjoyment of a
delicious Woman, without reflecting, that any body else might have had her as
well as I. It Is an impertinent Curiosity in our Natures, that when we have
discovered as much as we can, to please us, will always drive us upon something
to find fault with: Curiosity did I call it? Nay, Gad, there is ingratitude in
the bottom on it, I believe; for it is the way of the World, in other favors
too; to lessen those Obligations, as much as we can, which we have not in our
honesty to return. Pox, I hate to be ungrateful: But I cannot be ungrateful
here, if I would; for there was nothing designed to me of the benefits I
received: Wishwell let me in, at the hour appointed for Sir Ruff: The Lady
received me for Sir Ruff; but when I think of the plesures that came after,
that she should still mistake me, for that bargaining Booby of her Bawds
providing; I don't forgive her; The furious riot, the expense of Charms, the
prodigality of Life, and Love (too vast for Nature's Bounty to support another
hour) might have informed her better

It Is not yet Day: Wishwell's my Convoy; I cannot get off without her:

No matter now, if she knows me.

Who Is this follows me?

I have slept away my life,

My better part of it, my life of Love: He Is gone from me:

Was this an hour of rest? Sleep had been welcome in a Husband's Bed; but in a
Lover's Arms! he stole away, fearful of waking me, and fearful to be seen, he
stole away

In every thing, showing his care of me: How could Sir Ruff do this? O Love!
what can thou not do in a Woman's Heart

That brutal thing, whom, as I thought, I loathed,

Thy gentle Fires have softened by degrees, and melted into Gayman: Night be
still my Friend, let me not see him, and I will think it was my Gayman still


O this Woman! I love her for her self, but hate her too.


Who Is there?


Your Lover.


O! be but ever so: Can you forget? Can you forgive me?

Can you excuse my being to be sold?

Let Wishwell bear the mercinary blame --

Her baseness wrought me to her sordid ends:

But I Will return your Bills --


Return my Love: My Fortune is but yours.


You are my better Fortune.


O this happy Night. But to remember it,

A Locket, or your Picture --


Take this Ring, to make a better Marriage.

Have you forgiven me?


How shall I convince you?


Why, only say you have.


Saying is too little: Doing's the living proof, that never lies; within you
will believe me --


Madam, Madam, where are you? Bless my Eyesight!


Bless the Woman: What Is the matter?


Are you the happy Man; Mr. Gayman?


Gayman!


Thank you for making me so, Mrs. Wishwell.


Gayman! then I am ruined:

Base Woman! have I deserved this from you?


No, but you deserve it from your self,

For putting this trick upon me --


I put a trick upon you!


And you will find the benefit of it, in a little time; my Lord, and his
drunken Companions, are coming up Stairs, to visit you: As you have managed the
business without me; even get off on it, as well as you can; I wash my hands of
it, and will retire without being seen


O every way undone! follow her down the back Stairs --


Pox take her; she has double-lockt the Door.


What shall I do! what will become of me!


Nay, Madam, let the worst come to the worst,

Sir Ruff is obliged to take care of you --

But I Will bring you off this time, I warrant you.

And he that is given to dote,

On Woman's inconstancy:

I would not be in his Coat,

For a great deal of ready Money.

What! my Lady, and Gayman!

Are you too up together early, or late?

Here Is my Lord and I are in Conjunction too:

Why faith, Madam, we thought of nothing, but the Spirit of Clery:

We did not expect such good Company, my Lord --


No, really, I did not expect to find a Man with my Wife.


But see how odly things will happen sometimes.


Ay, so they will, very odly indeed sometimes.


Odly, Mr. Granger! -- What the Devil do you mean?


I Will bring you off, I warrant you. Madam,

Gayman's an honest, well conditioned Fellow;

But somewhat sleepy toward Morning:

How did your Ladyship get him up so soon?


Prithee recollect thy self: All Is ruined else.


I must go snacks, Gayman.


He Is must'ring all his little Malice, 'twill end in mischief certainly.


Nick, go you and fetch the Constable:

But before he comes, Madam, I command you,

In the King's Name, to tell me, what you two have been doing together, in my
absence, against the peace of my Bed, and Bosom


Doing, my Lord!

Why it is plain enough what we have been doing!

Any body may see what we have been doing --


Very plainly, my Lord.


Or if they cannot see; it is but hearing you talk, as you do; and they may
easily find what you have been doing

Did not we sup together?


The Devil's always very powerful at this time of the Morning, Gentlemen; but
bear Witness

He says, they supt together!


They supt together! We, I say we; Granger, your Lordship and I, and these two
honest Gentlemen. Gentlemen, I shall be proud to be better known to you

Pox, do you think I don't know what I say?
They remember me, though you will not, my Lord.

What! not remember Mr. Gayman!


O! perfectly, my Lord.


Why, my noble Lord, you are farther gone than I thought you were: If you drink
your Friends down with your Bottle, I have done with you: Why, Gentlemen, I
don't believe you drank very hard after I left you


Not very hard, Sir.


Not above a Bottle a piece, after you left us.


Well, a clear Conscience is a great matter, I see.


After he left us! Why, then I am drunk, and did not know it before: To my own
thinking now I remember every thing in the Company as perfecty --

Why how can a Man tell, at this rate, whether he is sober, or no?


Nay, I had been in the same pickle, if I had staid with you:

But when you saw I began to be maukish, you may remember, you sent me home
before you, to knock up Mrs. Darkas, for the Cordial Waters; And you were to
follow me


Not that I know of.


Nay, my Lord, there you must excuse me; truth is truth; you did send him home,
for how could we else have found him here


Why that is true: Why, well, if I have forgot it, I beg all your Pardons.


Is it not enough, my Lord, that you come home, at these unseasonable hours,
but you must send up your drunken Companions before you

Wishwell, and I were asleep,

When this unmannerly Royster came into the Dining Room: We thought There had
been Thieves, and poor Wishwell was almost frighted out of her Senses


I must close with her, for my own sake.


Was this well done, my Lord? Yet I will not think you could be so ill a Man to
design it, as a Plot upon my Honor, I will not think you could


My Lord, my Lord is this the use you make of what I told you?
Do you deserve so good a Lady?
And Mr. Gayman, was it like your Character,
To be Confederate in so base an undertaking?
And all of you to make a Combination --

Nay, Wishwell, as I hope to be saved now, 'twas altogether an Accident, no
body had the least design upon my Wife, or her Honor, that I know of

There has happened some little mistakes, I must needs say;
But I am always so deaf with drinking, you know --
Gad so! here is Music: See who it is that Serenades,
I love Serenading mightily.

I have out-stay'd my Assignation;
But this Serenade will make her amends.
What Is here? Gayman! Dammee, Sir, a man's well helped up, that trusts to you
for a second: I waited for you above two hours

I was all that while serving you elsewhere.


What do you mean?


Why do you think your self a fit Man for a Backdoor? You might as well have
trusted 'em again to let you in at the Window: The Ladies designed to laugh at
you, and being your Friend, I made the quarrel, to send you out of their Power


Nay, Gad, I thought there was something in it:
For when Sir Symphony and I came face to face,
We were presently Friends, and agreed upon the Fiddles.
But since they designed to make an Ass of me,
I Will have satisfaction, or my Money again.

Experience can never be bought too dear, Sir.


Zounds, Sir, I Will go to her, and tell her she lies.


I Am glad I know your Principles.


Sir Symphony, why do you look so angry?

I hate Bloodshed; then Sir Ruff and you are Old Friends; besides, Gayman, and
I had business, as you see, Sir; but how went the Tilt? Ha! I Am sorry, for both
your sakes, I can see through neither of you

I love a Visto, as my Lord says, mightily.


There are some Masquers-below,
Desire to be admitted.

O Gemeni! Wife, let 'em come up:

Hark, you, Gentlemen, Let Us even make a Night on it:
I have some Masquing Habits within; Captain Tilter,
Sir Ruff, Sir Symphony, we'll all be in Disguise.
I love a disguise, when every body knows one, mightily.

Hang your Masquerades, I begin to be tired of 'em:
It Is losing ones labor always upon other Men's
Mistresses; when you have waited upon a Gentlewoman
Through the Ceremonies of the Night,
And think of going home with her,

Though you have crammed her Pockets as full of Sweetmeats as they can hold: Her
own Spark appears in the Morning; beats you, perhaps, for offering to lead her
to her Coach, and forces you to walk home, ankle deep, in your Turkish Habit

O very Foolish! Leave Sir Symphony to his own face,
He Will make nothing of that, I dare say for him:
Come, Gentlemen, we shall be pure and merry,
When we don't know one another.

I Am as good as my word, you see, Madam,

I Have brought you off: I have been obliged to you, and have returned you your
favor: But you must own Madam, mine carries something the better air along
with it; because I generously designed it for your Ladyship


What shall I say? What can I say?


I will not upbraid you, Madam, you have done me the second good turn you had in
your Power to bestow: And since 'twas impossible to have you to my self; it
goes a great way in my Cure, to know that any Fool may engage you for the time


O very fortunate! And kind in you, and all the Good Company: How came I by
this favor


Why, truly, Madam, being up at Cards, at Lady Trickitts, over the way, we
could not resist the temptation of the Fiddles


But came in our Masks,
For fear we should not be welcome.

So near a Relation cannot doubt that, Madam.


Ladies, I esteem my self very luckily here,
For the Entertainment of so much good Company:
I have some Gentlemen in my Consort,
Whom I can prevail upon, to treat you in their way, with a Song, or a Dance.

TEll me no more I am deceived,
That Cloe's False, and Common:
By Heaven, I all along believed,
She was a very Woman:
As such IN liked, as such caressed,
She still was Constant, when possessed,
She could do more for no'Man.
But oh! Her thoughts on others ran;
And that you think a hard thing:
Perhaps she fancied you the Man;
Why what care I one Farthing.
You think she is false, I Am sure she is Kind:
I Will take her Body, you her Mind;
Who has the better bargain?
Dear, Madam, I beg you a thousand Pardons,


O Jesu! For what, Mr. Granger?


Till you pulled off your Masque, I took you for a Scandalous Creature, I met
in St. Iame's-Park last Night; she was dressed so like you


That Lady was no ill Friend of yours, I assure you.


You have no cause to speak well of her; for she would have made me believe, you
were as bad as her self

Pox on her, how she haunts me --

What has Lady Susan done, Sir Symphony,
You don't make your Court to her?

I find he does not think it for his Reputation to marry a Woman, that would
meet him in private

I Will mention it no farther.


May I presume, Madam, that this opportunity may be more favorable to my
hopes. --


Lord, Sir, I know nothing of an opportunity; pray be quiet, you would not talk
of an opportunity before People, would you

Why I never saw the like of you. --


She always uses me ill before Company.


Was it fine Walking last night, Mr. Granger?

Was there good Company at Rosamond's-Pond?


I did not see your Ladyship there.


Me! Fie, fie, a Married Woman there! Mr. Granger!


What you were more Houswifely employed?


More to my mind a great deal.


In private, Madam?


In Laughing at you. Lord! Mr. Granger, I thought you had been off the Vanity
of thinking Women in love with you: It Is past time a day for you to send
Love Letters about the Neighborhood, to corrupt the civil Families: How had
you the Conscience to think a Woman would have any business with you, but to
laugh at you? I vow I thought you had been wiser


Faith I thought so my self, Madam.


And why would you put your self into any Woman's power to disappoint you? I
thought the Young Fellows only, the Beaus of a Years standing in the side Box,
could be disappointed; Who, by the extraordinary opinion of themselves, from
their first Summons, imagine it impossible for any Woman to stay away from 'em

But you are satisfied at last, I see.


Indeed I am, that I was always in the wrong, when I had the least good opinion
of you. I was in hopes of having it in my power to use you, as you deserve
(which you should have been sure of) but since you have gone before me in this,
I promise you, you shall never get the better of me in any other business as
long as l know you: And till you are Older, I cannot like you worse than I do.


You have convinced and obliged me;
And I thank you for the satisfaction.

Pray thank me, when you're obliged, Mr. Garnish;
I have done nothing to convince you:
'Twas necessary to clear my self;
And I have done it, without a regard to your jealous thoughts upon the matter.

I promise you, I Will never be jealous more.


Then here I promise you, I Will never give you cause to be jealous.


Who have we here?


The Ladies shall know us, if they please.


We Are men for their turn; Sons of Darkness, And fit for the business of the
Night


To beat up a Bawdy House, you Scoundrels,
How came you here?

Why don't you know us?
You're the strangest People in the World! Murder a Man in his own House!

I Am for defending the Ladies.


How could thou be so barbarous to the Cuckold of thy bosom, to frighten him
so terribly


He began to be troublesome:

Besides I have at present a Quarrel to the Family.


I hope you are not hurt, Mr. Granger,
I would not for the World, I Vow now,
Have such a thing happen in my Company:
What will the World say?

Why even nothing at all:
The world does not care if we were Hanged,
I assure you.

This Ring, Madam, I Valued only as an Evidence of my good fortune, which,
since the case is so plain, I return to your Ladyship again

I don't observe that dearness between you, and Mrs. Wishwell, that used to be;
don't let me make a breach in that Friendship, which may be so serviceable to
you both: You're both in a mistake, neither has betrayed the other: Indeed Sir
Ruff made me his Confident, and qualified me for the welcome I have found. Mrs.
Wishwell, now I Am sure you will be my Friend, since you know I have it in my
Power to be your Enemy

And for you, Madam, I am obliged to justify you to every body, but my self.


It Is more than I deserve. O, I must hate you,
You have undone me with the only Man
I ever Loved or shall --

Then I am sure to keep her in my own Power.


Lord! this is the oddest thing in the World,

Turn a Man out of his own Doors, for coming to divert you: 'Twas as much as I
could do, I Vow now, to persuade the Footman to let me in again


Why, were you one of 'em, my Lord?


One of 'em, yes I think I was.


Who would have thought you kept such Company?


We did not know you, my Lord.


Sir Ruff, I assure you, takes it bloody ill of you; if it had not been in my
house

He Swears, he would have mauld some of you.

I don't know but he may send you a Challenge.


I hope not so, my Lord.


Nay, I Will make it up, if I can.


My Lord, you come very seasonably for the clearing of some difficulties, that
have happened to night, in Relation to your Lady


Lord! what does he mean?


I would vindicate her Virtue, as much as I can, from any unreasonable
suspicions, you may have of it, upon my account; and therefore declare, in the
prefence of all this good Company, that I have no design upon any body in it,
but this Lady: And here I offer to Marry her.


Nay then he does revenge himself indeed --


What say you, Madam?


Why, nothing, nothing in the World: Poor Rogue!

Silence gives consent, all the Town over.


Madam, your Ladyships interest would go a great way in perswadeing her.


Nay, my Wife will be for it I Am sure.


Mr. Gayman, you may be sure of me --

To persuade her against it if I could.
Would I might never see his Face again.

Well, we shall live so pure and merry at one another Houses: Would you were
all Married, Gentlemen; there is no making a Friend thoroughly Welcome, I can
tell you, without having a Wife of ones own to receive him


O Law! Mr. Granger, what if you, and I, should make it the Double Marriage?


It Is an Old Play, Madam, and will never take.


The Devil take him, I don't know what to make of him.


I know your thoughts, Maria.


Come, Madam, give me your hand.


Well, Sir, you may repent this rashness.


I may repent of some things that are past:

But I can never do any thing with you, to repent of.


How the Tyrant Triumphs!


You see, Madam, how happy you might make your humble Servant.


O Law! Sir! You don't think so.


Hey day! Here Is my Aunt upon the prick of Preferment too: Sir Symphony, and
she are agreeing to go to Bed together


Well if it must be so --


Ay, ay, Uncle Symphony, with you joy of my Aunt Susan.


You do me the greatest Honor

In the World, Madam.


Gad so! Here Is Siam too, the more the merrier, we shall want Company to dance
at all these Weddings: You shall be my partner, Siam


Would I were unmarried, upon the Condition

I never danced at a Wedding again.


What Is the matter now, Siam?


Why the Captain has been drunkning with my Lord all night, and coming home in
one of his damned old Humors, has beaten me black and blue, and turned me out
of Doors.


How Is this, Captain?


We'll pull the old Rogue to pieces; beat his Wife!


Why Dolly, Dolly, you should bear with the failings of your Lord and Master --


I do bear with your failings, you know I do,

You old fumbling Fool you.


And not betray the secrets of my Dukedom, the Mysteries of our Bed, and Board,
Dolley


I Will be plagued with you no longer: I Will give you a separate Maintenance, and
be rid of you


I Will come in for my thirds, Dolly, that you know the Law will allow me: But
let us see you

Separate Maintenance: I Married you only to maintain me;
Who marries an Old Woman for any thing else?
And if I can make you Maintain me, do you see,
I don't much care whether I Am Married to you, or no:
But I know your Grievance; you would have me
Begin to propagate, like a Patriarch, at threescore,
And try to do good in my generation: But who
The Devil can do good upon you? You are
Past it as well as I; and so faith let us have a
Dance, and agree upon parting in the morning.

Well, Granger, you are still to continue a Batchelour, it seems


Why faith, Sir, it is as much as a Man can do, to secure a Reputation, in his
own keeping; he need not venture it in a Woman's

Especially when she Stakes so little against it:
For in Miscarriages of Marriage,
We favor still the weaker Sexes faults:
So when the Wife's abused, and Husband horned
The Woman's pitied, but the Cuckold Scorned.

SEE the Effects of a poor Maids Last Prayer,
Driven by mere want of Husband to despair.
And Ladies, in a Barren Age as this is,
It Is hard for all of us to have our Wishes.
She, for a time pretended to a Wit;
And yet you see her Project would not hit:
Let her Example teach you; there is no urging
These Sparks, to take an Antiquated Virgin
They fear the growing Cares of Married Lives,
And venture -- only on their Neighbors Wives.
Be Wise in time, set not too great a value
On your fine selves, and still stand, shall I, shall I.
For while the Dreams of Coach and Six deceive you,
The honest Squire, despised, may chance to leave you:
And when poor Maids are driven to Petition,
We seldom find they better their Condition
Yet thus with some of you it daily happens,
You lose the Beast, in hopes to get the Trappings.
You scorn to stoop below a Top Gallant:
And all pretend to Ride the Elephant:
As if you had forgot the thing you want.
Though each lost hour you pass a Fiery Trial,
And never refuse without a self-denial.
Led by the Custom of the Sex, you strive
To blind the World, while you your selves deceive:
You may pretend a nice indifference;
But Truth must still be Truth, while Sense, is Sense:
Disguise your Inclinations as you can:
Yet every Woman's Business is a Man.
