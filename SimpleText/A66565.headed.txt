Custom prevails, and somewhat must be said,
To tie your Hands, and save the Author's head;
It Is a new Play you will cry -- What then? -- 'Twere too
Too much to find you meat, and stomachs too:
But since it must -- Expect no Bill of fare,
No -- I shall only tell ye, What Is not here:
We Have no Sententious Sir -- No grave Sir Poll;
No little Pugge, nor Devil -- Bless us All!
No tedious Sieges to the Musick-room;
Nor frisks abroad -- No -- Our Scene's all at home:
But if you ask me, How? -- 'Troth, I Have forgot;
And now I think on it; -- It may spoil the Plot,
To give't you before hand -- What e're it be,
Have but a little Patience, and you will see.

SAD News my Masters; And too true, I fear,
For us -- Scruple's a silenced Minister;
Would ye the Cause? -- The Brethren snivle, and say,
It Is scandalous that any Cheat, but they:
Well -- To be short; H'as been before the Tryers,
And (by good Fortune) is got out of the Briars;
Where, if he lost a Limb to save the rest,
No hurt -- Here Is yet enough, to know the Beast:
Nor let the sisters pule -- (I ll tell y' a thing)
He may be libb'd, and yet have left, a string.

HOh! Major! -- Quibus Hector, etc.


Why faith the old Trade still; Here, and there, and every where: -- But how
now Captain! -- Latin! Latin! -- Send us fair weather; -- From small Beer,
and ends of Latin; -- Deliver me


Troth Iriss with as little often this morning, as the rest of my Neighbors:
And yet once to day, 'twas a measuring cast, whither I had English enough left
me, to carry me to bed


For why my man of Memphis? -- New adventures?


Small Game: -- However, it is better than idleness. -- A man would pick straws,
rather than not keep his hand in ure: -- Anything good Major in an honest way


You Are in the right Boy: -- But hark you -- Did'he bite?


Yes: -- And I Have struck him too.


A Squire? -- Another Squire?


He may be one in time: -- But for the present, he is only a small Bachelor of
the Law, new come to Town, to learn breeding


I Will say this -- And a fig for thee -- He has as hopeful a Tutor, as a man
need have raked Hell for


Mean you me Sir, or Runter the Civilian to whose care, his father by his last
will committed him


Never a Barrel better Herring -- Runter! -- Hah! Hah!


Why, he thinks himself a learned Man; And it is some sign that others are of
the same opinion -- I can assure you, he mist the Chancellorship of Dunstable,
as narrowly, as ever any man did, that went without it


Nay -- nay -- nay -- The Gentleman will be well bred, there is no doubt of 't:
-- But what is the business


Compositions Major -- Compositions -- A small Collation to save the effusion
of Christian blood: -- Ah that thou had seen him, while the Prudential, and
my Second were discoursing the business -- He looked so like dead a Horse, he
would neither eat, nor drink, before he knew, whither he should live, or dye:
-- But, as soon as the sum was agreed, and we had shaken hands upon it --. Whip
says Jethro! -- He was got drunk, ere I could wet my Whistle


But are the Pence numbered? -- Do they cry Chink in thy Pocket? -- How many
yellow Boys


Why faith Major, none; -- But we are to take up a 100 l. together, which will
be all one


But who must lay it down Captain? who must lay it down?


I have a small Broker, that for 40, or 50 l. has undertaken to procure it.


That may do well -- But hark you -- Where does your Horse stand? -- I hear of
a Purchase, and I must out to Night


No more good Major --. No more of that doleful Tune; -- The very remembrance
of 't puts me into a cold sweat


'Twas a pretty Nag -- Thou have not sold him?


Would 'twere no worse.


He is not stoll'n? -- No Rogues among our selves I hope?


Neither.


Or is he dead?


In Law, I think he be: -- I was out the other Night upon the Randan, and who
should I meet with but our old Gang, some of St. Nicholas's Clerks; Pad was the
word; The Booty set by the Chamberlain; We took it, and shared it; But coming
home, were all snap't by a Hue, and Cry, for another business, wherein I was
not concerned; which Mr. Constable perceiving, and imaging me as very a Rogue
as the rest, and that I would be glad to escape upon any terms; He takes me
aside, and tells me, That though I was not in this, yet there were others,
wherein I had been; And therefore (because I looked like a civil Gentleman,
merely drawn in by ill Company) if I would give him my Horse, he would let me
escape: -- You may easily believe, he did not speak to a deaf Man, or one that
had no mind to understand him -- I closed with him, got me to my Company, made
'um dead drunk, and when they were fast asleep, fairly marched off


That is to say -- Ran away.


And a good shift too: -- You are put to none of these hazards Major -- You lie
as safe in the Constable's house, as a Thief in a Mill; -- Or (to use a more
familiar expression) some of our friends in Newgate


Yes -- I could have better accomodations abroad, but he is my loving friend.


His Wife you mean.


Why -- She Is a good Girl -- And now you talk of these Trumperies, What Is
become of your small Cockatrice, the Astrologer Mopus his Wife


I have not seen her since my last mischance; I must even to her for new
riggings; -- I hope her Husband has had a good Term often; I Would live like a
Prince, if I could perform the tenth part of what his Bills promise: -- But see
Major! Pinnace sailing by -- Ah how she booms! -- Prithee hail her Man: Would
I Would the furling of her Main Sail


Landlord! Well met -- How now Landlady -- This is better than wish; -- I must
give you a Barrel of Oysters, and a Bottle or two of Wine, ere we part, Honest
Landlord!


O -- good Major -- Another time; we are going to exercise now.


But dear Landlord -- Captain, Advance, and know this Gentleman my friend, and
Landlord; -- He is the honestest fellow, and the best natured thing --


Thank you good Major -- I have always your good word.


I indeed Husband that you have; and more behind your back, than ever I told
you of.


Worthy Sir, your servants humble servant.


Alas good Captain -- Indeed and truly -- sweet Sir -- The Major and I are old
friends


And may you long continue so.


I thank you Sir: -- Come my Joy, shall's walk? I should be loath to have Mr.
Alderman there before us


I my Dear -- I stay for thee.


But hark you Hussy: --

Where shall you and I exercise? -- Cannot you drop him, or give him the slip,
for an hour or two


Oh -- No -- No -- We are to be at Repetition at Mr. Alderman's -- It Is Friday
Night -- But I shall see you anon: Farewell good Major -- Your servant Sir.


Your servant Lady.


Captain -- Prithee let us meet to morrow in the Afternoon, at Mother Formalls
the Midwife's; and bring your small Harlotry with you, -- we'll be merry


A match -- A match --


You are so Wise: -- I have observed, This World
Dwells most abroad, seldom, or never at home;
Most men can counsel others, few, themselves.

Hah! Sentences! -- There Is somewhat troubles you;
What is it? -- And can you call me friend, and yet
Not let me bear my part? Friends should be one;
Breath, Hope, Fear, Will, and Nill the same, in common.

Why -- What were you the better if you knew?
You cannot give me ease. --

However try;
A handsome Fellow! And a fair Estate!
And wit at will! -- Thou may command the Town;
Leave off this fooling: --

I Am beholding to you;
Can you with all your wisdom tell me now
Where this shoe wrings me?

No: --

Then pray believe
I know; and if you are my friend, forbear
A further scrutiny: --

My life, in Love!
Not past that Boys disease? That troublesome itch?
Come -- We'll be Jovial, and divert the humor.

Suppose I were? -- Is not the World the same?
Love is the Bond of Nature, and without it,
The Universe, were but a Besome unbound,
Sand, without Lime: --

I need no further Symptoms
To make the Crisis; -- Hah! -- And you believe,
This dainty Phylosophical Poultis,
Will work the Cure? -- If I have any skill,
There were a better Remedy: --

For shame
Thou Infidel to all that is good, or lovely;
May thou dye in thy Heresy, and never know
What a good Woman means; -- unless perhaps,
For thy conversion: --

This was intended
For a small Curse: -- But I must thank my friend;
And if he were not turned Bigott, I think,
Might satisfy him: You're in love forsooth!
All in good time -- But have you yet considered
What it is? How much more misery beyond it,
Then on this side of 't? -- you may fancy Castles,
And forty I know not what is, But they are of Snow,
Come one good shower, and farewell my sine Guegaw*

You Are a strange Fellow: -- What do think of those
Have gone before us, and commend it too?

One Woodcock makes no Winter: -- But I pray,
What are the persons? Are they not concerned?
These married Men, are like Boys in the water,
Ask 'um how 't goes, Oh! wondrous hot they cry,
When yet their Teeth chatter for very cold;
If you must love, love on; But go no further;
Women enjoyed, like Rivers in the Sea,
Lose both their Taste, and Name; suppose 'um Junoes
In the pursuit, they 're Clouds in the enjoyment.

Thou 'rt like the Fox, that having lost his Tail,
Would fain persuade the rest to make 't a fashion:
Prithee give over: --

Troth I Have scarce begun;
Suppose her handsome; She Is a Honey-pot
In The Sun; If otherwise; you will never endure her;
If honest; Insolent, though never so ugly;
She thinks, you are beholding to her for 't;
And yet, who knows how long she may be so:
Is she the Map of Modesty? perhaps
It Is but your own Opinion; Love is blind;
There Is many pass for such, whose Husbands yet,
Could, if they durst, tell you another Tale.
Is she a Housewife? Can she make a Band?
Order a Dairy? Cure a broken Shin?
Examine your Accounts, and at Years end,
Pray tell me what you have saved: -- Is she high born?
Twenty to one, She Is proud, and quickly scorns you:
What are you better for those doughty Acts
My Lord, Her great great Grandfather performed,
The Lord knows where? Or t'ave her Portion paid you
In Genealogies, Gilt Spurs, and Cantons.

Come -- I can hold no longer -- Have you done?

With your good patience, a word -- Consider,
It Is like a Battle, to be fought but once;
And therefore, if it must be so, Be sure
She be your Equal, and, if possible, Virtuous;
At least, not tainted with her Mothers Vices:
And now, if after this, thou dare be wiving,
The art a bold Fellow, and that is all I Will say;
Heaven keep thee yet within the power of Heleboure.

Prithee be n't so severe: -- Thou art my friend,
And I Will deal plainly with thee -- That Estate
Which you believe so fair (And were 't not for
My father's Debts, and some small slips of mine,
Might have looked somewhat like it) is at present,
At that low Ebb, That if I don't look to it,
In time, 'twill be quite past Recovery:
Come -- The Red Petticoat must piece up all:

'T 'as a half-face of Reason: -- As you say,
Desperate Causes, must have desperate Cures:
But what is he, has got this hank upon 't?

Did you never hear of Alderman Whitebroth?

I, there is a Jew indeed -- I Will tell thee what,
He has a Daughter, Thou shall have her too,
Though it be but to be revenged of him.

There spoke my friend: -- O -- but her father: --

What?

-- Will never give consent: --

To choose; -- She Will make
The better Wife, to justify her folly.

Prithee be serious: --

Good faith I am;
And if thou have her not, one way, or other,
I Will be thy Bondsman: -- We'll about it straight.

Saturn, and Jupiter, come to a Trine in Taurus, and Capricorn -- Huh -- We
shall have strangers come to Town, and their Wives never miss 'um in the
Country: -- Next Month they all meet in the house of Mercury, he being Lord
thereof, and Significator of Speech; It may intend, Advocates, Cryers of
Courts, Splitters of Causes, Oysters Wives, and Broom Men: -- Hold -- Saturn
-- (nothing but this malevolent Planet) in the sign Virgo, in conjunction with
Venus, in her detriment: -- Beware Women, of green Gowns; Great men, of Stone,
and Colic, and Costermongers, of rotten Pippins: -- Again -- Pars torturae,
coupled with the Catabibason, That is to say, The Dragons Tail: -- Huh -- Huh
-- Children shall be subject to Convulsion sits, young Wenches to the Falling
Evil, and old Women to Cough out their Teeth: -- Diseases, and Resolve all
Astrological Questions) and yet they will hardly quit cost, for pasting 'um up:
-- Here dwells an Astrological Physician, Reads one; -- And there let him, till
I trouble him, Answers another; -- His Majesty's most excellent Operator, says
one -- Yes -- upon a Post quoth another: And thus you see, how an Artist is
valued: -- O Ignorance! Ignorance! Well may thou be the Mother of Devotion,
but I am sure thou art the Stepdame of Art: -- If it were not for the good
Women with their Groats, and their Vinegar Bottles, and now and then a young
Wench to enquire of her Sweetheart, I might even hang my self; Nay (which were
worse) my wife would cry her Trade were the better of the two: -- But, Hushed! --
I hear some body coming -- Ten to one but it is my young Squire, with his
Mercers Wife to have her Fortune read -- I could with less trouble, and more
certainty have told her Husband's: -- I hear 'um -- Hushed -- My Wife understood
their meaning well edough, shemight have put 'um together without troubling me:
--


But ill enough I Am sure -- I wonder what I Am the better for a Husband in you!
-- Here you sit moping, and moping all day upon a Book, and at Night, you're as
sleepy as a gib'd Cat


Oh ho -- I Am in thy debt, but thou shall be paid it altogether: -- Is it not
better to receive a 100 l. at one payment, than to dribble't out by shilling,
and shilling


But you would be loath though, if your Wife had an occasion, that she should
borrow, though 'twere but sixpence


Thou say right -- But I dare trust thee further: Prithee go in, and look
after the House; we shall have some or other, come popping in presently


To mighty purpose -- It Is well you get so much: -- Methinks Trading is grown
extreme dead: -- Time was, when your honest Citizen's Wives, and no ordinary
Madams, and their Gallants, would come and be merry here; -- But now --


A little patience good Wife; 't'as been a long Vexation, the Gentry are not
come to Town yet; -- and yet we have some doings too


Yes -- A Company of Fribbles, enough to discredit any honest House in the
World: -- No, I Would have you to know, I am for none of your Skip-Jacks; -- No; --
Give me your Persons of Quality, there is somewhat to be got by them: Besides, a
Woman need not be ashamed to sit Jig by Joule, with the best of the Parish, and
who dare say, Black is her eye


Prithee be quiet -- I expected a young Squire, and his Mistress; but I believe
she could not get out, her Husband is so jealous of her


Now out upon her -- Could she not have took another Woman out with her? He has
been a good one himself (I warrant you) that shall offer to suspect two Women
together: -- Marry hang these jealous-headed Coxcombs, these Ass-Cuckolds, that
believe their Ears to be Horns; And such have you been in your time too -- That
you have


Well -- Well -- Go in -- All shall be mended -- Prithee in.


No indeed, I don't intend it; I must have some money first: -- Do you think I
can go always in one Gown? -- Pray don't mistake yourself: -- Besides, I must
buy the Child a new Coat; and Mr. Scruple expects I should carry him something
for his pains amongst us: -- Indeed Husband, he is a precious, able man


Yes -- He is able -- Able to speak more with ease, than another man can hear
with patience: -- Away you fool


Nay good Husband -- How do you think a Woman can love you, if you will not let
her do as the rest of her Neighbors? -- I warrant you for them, not one of
them mist the meeting to day, and I hope you have found, that they are not the
worst Customers we have: -- Marry come up here -- Scruple


Be quiet, and thou shall't have any thing: -- I must even stop her mouth, to
be rid of her -- Nile, are but still Music to it: -- Come, we'll in, and see
what may be done.


INdeed your father was my old acquaintance, and very good friend -- Ah! How it
tickles my Lungs, to think how many mad Frolicks we have had, at Robbing of
Orchards, and stealing Pudding-pyes -- I hope I may take it for granted, that
you visited the University: -- Pray which of 'um? and what College


Gotam College Sir, in the University of Rumford.


My Fellow Collegiate! -- You and I must be acquainted: -- Pray how goes the
old difference between the Scholars, and the Townsmen? Is the breach so wide,
that you believe it irreconcilable


Indeed I cannot tell -- But it is thought, 'twill hardly be composed, unless
the Rams would forbear marrying


The more's the pity: -- A Graduate I hope Sir.


Yes Sir -- A small one -- A Bachelor of the Law -- I went out Bachelor, last
Horse-fair


And I Doctor, in the Throng: -- We must be better acquainted: -- You're come
up to study


Yes Sir -- My Mother would have it so.


Then let me advise you -- Study both Laws, but chiefly, the Civil: -- You
would not think what an advantage it is, to be a general man


Sir, I shall follow your directions.


Then, when you come to practice; you must get you a good brass Towel, and a
steel Countenance; and ever carry in your green Bag, so much patience, as not
to be discouraged at any thing; for I am to tell you a great Truth, That our
Profession Rotts at the wrong end, The young ones dye, and the old ones live,
But how I pray? Even like Bawds, and Medlars, never Ripe, till Rotten; That is
to say, seldom or never get money, till they are past the use of 't; And then
(perhaps) what with a little favor, and a great deal of money, they may chance
to arrive at last to the height of sleeping out a Cause


I thank you Sir, and I hope I shall be able to remember it.


Then you must ever be obsequious to great men; not that you expect any good
from 'um, but (as the Chinese worship the Devil) that they do you no hurt: --
Then, be sure to keep your Chamber, it will keep you; I kept mine many a long
year, and nothing came; But at last (Thanks to my Stars, and these good Times)
it came to the purpose


Yes Sir, I know this to be true, for my Mother would be continually preaching
this Lesson to my Father


Then you must never examine your Cause, whither it be good, or bad; If it be
good, and of no great concernment, it will carry it self, If bad, there is your
Masterpiece, to help it out; Every Fool can manage a good Cause, but He Is your
Man, can set the Nose to which side he pleases, and make something, out of
nothing


I hope I shall have the grace to put it in practice; and wish, my Father were
alive to thank you


Then if at any time, you find you have the worst end of the staff; Leave your
Cause, and fall upon the person of your Adversary; Put it out boldly, and
enough of 't, and somewhat must stick; No matter how true, or false, it begets
a prejudice to the person, and many times forjudges the Cause: -- For Example
now, to give you an instance in a Gentleman, a friend of mine, a great Master
of this way of pleading: -- A Gentleman with a long comely beard, demurrs to
his Clients Bill; My friend, takes him at first hop, and demurrs to his beard;
calls it a Vow-beard, and that he had made an Oath not to cut it till the King
came in; And hark you, had he had Twenty Arguments, he might have better
spared the other Nineteen, than that One: -- I could tell you of as good a one
of my own, and upon as great a Person as any this day in Europe -- (Ah! how I
firk't him up, with -- a Chip of the old Block, and Twenty as good --) But
enough of this now -- The thing is sufficiently known, and it ill becomes a man
to set out his own Virtues; -- But try this, and do it boldly, and never doubt
of Clients: -- A modest Lawyer! -- A silent Woman! -- A Paradox in Nature


I can but thank you still Sir.


I had almost forgot one thing, and no way inferior to any of the rest: -- If
you find any Commotion in the State, be sure to strike in with the first; If
you get nothing -- Cantabit vacuus -- You Will pass in the Crowd; If you do,
you will have money enough to purchase your pardon, and perhaps too, get in to be
some great man's Advocate: -- Chew the Cud upon this for the present, and as I
find you growing up to it, I shall instruct you farther.


I Do profess, this Mr. Scruple is a singular man.


I indeed is he: -- I never edified under any man like him: -- But how do you my
Lamb? How do you


A vengeance over grown one; -- I have seen many a Ram in my time, has not been
so big by the head and the horns.


How do you Sir? -- You don't look well.


Nothing but a Cold my Child -- nothing but a Cold: I hope' twill away again:
--


Cis -- Cis -- A stick of Licoras Cis.


I have some Candid Ginger forsooth.


Here Chick -- prithee bite a bit often -- it is the most sovereign thing (next a
Pepper posset) as can be


Save your good Worship -- It fell in an ill time -- I am afraid it may beget
an obstruction of justice, by hindering your Worships sitting on the Bench


How d' you Neighbors both? How do you? -- you're welcome, -- Diligence, you
and I Will walk in, and leave the Women to entertain Mr. Scruple


I wait upon your Worship.


Timothy.


Madam.


Quickly good Timothy, quickly -- Run in, and get the Towels ready: -- After
good Cis, after him, and see they be through warm: --

Oh Mr. Scruple, Mr. Scruple! -- Alas good man how he sweats! -- Tim. Tim. Tim.
-- A Towel Tim, a Towel -- quick -- quick -- quick.


Here forsooth.


Now blessing of your heart good Mr. Scruple, you have taken a great deal of
pains to day


Or his Lungs have, which is all one.


Truly, and indeed, a great Pains-taker: -- Scruple -- You have stood long to
day -- Pray sit down -- We must Rule you here. -- Will you have a Caudle Sir?
-- Alas poor man! How wet the Collar of his Shirt is? -- Feel Diligence -- I
prithee feel


Now beshrew me, but't 'as work't quite through his Doublet, Coat, Cloak and
all


Hum -- I am refreshed -- yea in good sooth I am.


Will you have a Lemmon Posset Sir?


I fear me it is too cold.


Will you go to Bed Sir? -- Or have a fresh Shirt? -- How do you Sir?


Troth very ill, upon a Text.


I am well enough -- only a qualm -- a qualm.


What say you to your Collar of S'. S. then?


That would not be amiss -- There Is no false Latin in it.


Quickly Tim, quickly: -- A Pint of Sack, a Quart of Sider, and a handful, or
two, of Sugar, and put 'um into the great Bowl -- Run Timothy, Run: -- Dear
Child, do thou help him


Call you me this, his Collar of S'. S? --


I am afraid you are not well Sir.


Yes -- I am so, so: -- You would not think how't has recovered me, one would
hardly believe, what a rejoicing to my spirit it is, to see you thus eager,
and, as it were, hungry for your food: -- Ah-Be the same still you cannot lay
out your selves, nor I my self forth enough, in these ways -- Pray mark it; --
We cannot lay out our selves forth enough one to another: -- These often Duties
put us into a spiritual posture of War -- Ah -- It is best fighting together --
Ah -- What a precious thing it is, when we are both concerned together, and --
Ah -- Ah -- as a man may say, wrapped up in one common Cause and Interest: -- Ah
-- Good sisterly women, consider it, and lay it upon your hearts. Alderman?
Methought I heard him Cough ere while: -- How does he


Now indeed, I think he sat a little too long in the cold: -- He has gotten a
heavy Cough of 't


To see the frailty of man's Nature! -- How weary of every thing that is good!
How irksom it is unto us! -- I dare undertake, he should have sat at a lewd
Stage Play, a whole Afternoon: -- Nay, with his Hat off too -- and -- Ah --
been never the worse


But are these Stage Plays, such lewd things as you make them?


Why truly you are my bosome-sisters -- And I may speak Truth to you; -- Nay --
They are not -- For you will find good moral things in them, As Vice deprest,
Virtue encouraged, and the like; However, we have thought it fit, to rail
at'um, for fear the people should set their hearts upon 'um, and consequently,
undo us: -- I have often Lectur'd at'um, in a morning, and yet in the
afternoon, stoll'n behind a Pillar, to hear 'um. -- Timothy: -- Timothy --
Though the Bowl be scandalous, it is pity the good creature should be spoiled:
-- Pray, next time, let me have the great Tankard, I am of opinion too, it
holds somewhat more: -- Casuists, speak comfortably in this point -- A man may
eat, and drink abundantly, without any necessity, but merely for his pleasure;
Nay, he may; usque ad vomitum ingurgitare, provided always, he do not
prejudice his health thereby; Because it is allowable in the natural appetite,
to be taken up with those actions, that are proper thereunto: -- We must deny
our selves, we may not deny the creature -- Pray observe it -- I say, we may
not deny the creature, it being given us, not for our sustentation only, but
contentation also -- Timothy -- Prithee once more good Timothy


Here Sir.


Now much good may do it your heart good Mr. Scruple.


Indeed he deserves a good thing, he makes so much of it, when he has it.


This is napping Geer, and well encouraged: -- But pray no more of this Bowl
-- Pray no more often: -- For this time, it may pass: -- Now trust me, it has
such a pleasant farewell, it invites a man to drink often of it: -- Timothy --


Here Sir.


I do assure ye, special stuff, and too good for the wicked; it may strengthen
them in their Enormities: -- But come -- Let Us go visit Mr. Alderman: --
Timothy -- Is all out


Yes Sir -- Not a drop left.


Then pray speak to Ruth, to dress up the great Tankard, and bring it into Mr.
Alderman's Chamber


It shall be done Sir.


HUh! He grows worse, and worse: -- I have been with the Doctor, and he will be
here presently: -- Precions Mr. Scruple is departed, but so like a Dog
out-lawed, that unless the Devil owes me a mischief, I may be troubled with a
mourning Cloak; -- I am sure I have deserved it: -- I am the general Officer of
this house; Like my Mistresses Silver-sack-posset-bason; Screw a handle to it,
and it is her Bed-pan; put a Cover to that, her Warming-pan; Take off both, it
serves to wash her hands in the morning, and for a Sack-posset, at Supper: --
In the Stable, I am Groom; In the Garden, Gardner; At Market, Caterer; In the
Cellar, Butler; upon all Visits, her Gentleman Usher; And above Stairs, his
Valet de Chamber.


How does your Master?


Alack Sir! I thought you could have told that by the Stars; -- I have heard
say, That learned men know every thing


Yes -- I could have erected a Scheme -- But I thought it unnecessary: -- How
does he take his rest


But ill; And complains of heats, and gripings.


I Will set him right again -- unless the Stars --


What good Sir?


Have predecree'd the contrary -- And if so -- We must submit; -- Will you let
your Mistress know I am here


I shall Sir.


So -- There Is half the disease; I shall easily pick the rest, out of the good
woman: -- It all things hit right, this Alderman may prove a good milch Cow: --


You're welcome Sir -- Nay, what d' you mean? there is no body expects it; --
Pray be pleased -- I can assure you no; -- In truth I do not -- Pray Sir. --


O -- your servant. -- Have you saved the Alderman's water, as I ordered?


Yes Sir: -- Cis, Cis; Thy Masters state.


O Tim, Tim, 'twas in the silver Tankard, and the Cat overthrew it.


There stands some dead Ale upon the Table, put that in the Urinal; -- He Will
tell as much by one, as the other.


A most fortunate face: -- I never met with more lucky lines: -- You Will live,
to bury the Alderman -- and -- shall marry -- let me see; -- a Lord


Indeed Sir? -- I believe you can tell.


Nay, I am certain of it: -- Hereafter, I may chance to tell you his name; --
But for the present, be sure he is a Vicount, at least


This --


Oh -- let me see it -- High colored -- His blood's enflamed: -- Feavourish --
Feavourish.


Indeed Sir he burns like fire.


Sick -- sick -- sick -- He cannot rest.


I indeed; -- you are as right --


Sometimes up, and sometimes down.


Truly he has not been out of his Bed, since he first took his Cold, till just
now


Huh -- a Cold: --


Now bless me Sir! -- How is it possible you should hit things so right?


How do you hit your mouth in the dark? -- One's as easy as the other: -- That is
to say; to a man of Art; -- I could tell you a Thousand things -- But time is
precious with me: -- May I not see the Alderman


O by all means; -- I hear him coming: -- O my Deat -- Here Is a Gentleman has
told me all your distemper, as right --


And what does he think of it?


Pray bend your wrist Sir. --


Would not some Parma City do him good? Truly I would be loath, he should want
any thing


You do well: -- Let me see -- What says the College? -- Sperma Caeti,
Confectioquaedam -- Pox on it -- I have forgot the rest: -- Sperma Caeti! --
Sperma Cocks-comb -- They Are a Company of quacking Fools; -- It Is Parmacitty,
and takes its name, from the City of Parma: Hang this foisting: -- I Will trust
never a Doctor of them all: --

Have a little patience Madam, and I Will send you a preparation of my own: -- In
the mean time your servant: -- I am staid for at present.


Farewell good Doctor: -- Come my heart -- rest thy self within.


AND how d' you like her now? --


Could I like Heaven, If I were there? -- 'Prithee forbear these Questions.


And much good may she do thee: -- Thou shall have her; I Have laid the Plot, and
I am sure 'twill take


As how my Jolly?


Not so hasty: -- I have an odd humor in my pocket will strike fair to it.


What Is here? A printed Bill? -- Prithee lets hear't.


In the Name of God, Through the light of the Son, By the Revelation of the
Spirit, I cure these Diseases, perfectly, and speedily, without any annoyance
to the body, which commonly happens through College Bills, and Apothecaries
Medicines, with which, the Devil has deceived the World, these many Hundreds of
Years

The new Disease (otherwise called the Great POX) with all its Appendices, in
few days; with Herbs which I gather in the Woods, and Gums of Trees. -- Agues
of all sorts, in three fits: -- Gout, whither-knotted, or running, in four or
five dressings: -- Dropsy -- Timpany -- Rickets -- Spleen -- Convulsion --
Yellow, and black Jaundies -- Stone -- St^angury -- and Chollick, in six hours:
-- All kinds of Fluxes; -- Most distempers of the Head -- Shortness of Breath,
and Ptisick, at first sight: -- And have ever by me a most approved Remedy,
against Green Sickness -- Barrenness -- And fits of the Mother


'Twas fairly vied: -- Who bids more?


He comes again -- As also (To let the World see, how wide of their mark, they
are like to run, That as boldly, as ignorantly, dare adventure on Physic,
without the knowledge of Astrology) I resolve, these ensuing Astrological
Questions

-- The sick, whither they shall recover, or not: -- The party absent, whither
living, or dead -- How many Husbands, or Children, a Woman shall have: --
Whither one shall marry the party desired, or whom else: -- Whither a Woman has
her Maidenhead or not -- Or shall be honest after Marriage -- Or her portion
well paid: -- If a man be wise, or a fool; -- Whither it be good to put on new
Clothes: -- If Dreams, be for good, or evil; -- Whither a Child be the reputed
fathers; or shall be fortunate, or not: -- Ships at Sea, whither safe, or not:
-- Of Lawsuits, which side shall have the better: -- And generally all
Astrological Questions whatever

A Servant of God, and Secretary of Nature.


Hah Boys! -- If this wo'n't take 'um, The Devil take 'um: -- But what are
those hard words


Oh -- A Physician, a friend to Physicians: -- The only true thing in all his
Bill; -- These Quacks, are the best friends Physicians have, they make work for
'um: What dost' think is come into my head


How is it possible I should know? -- I am no Oedipus.


Why -- This Fellow must be a Cheat, and I am confident, with a little help,
would be able to do your business: -- 'Prithee lets to him: --


This is such fortune, I forgive my stars
All their unkindness.

Is this Natural? Or do you carry set-forms about you, to be used as occasion
shall serve


Faith neither -- So much Excellence, must needs inform a Statue, and make a
very Post Rhetorical


Demonstrations? -- Why how now Mr. Afterwitt?


Just as you see: -- How d' you like him?


Well said: -- To her again: -- If I can make no sport,
I Will mar none: -- How now Cis?

The better for your asking, I thank you Sir.


Hark you: -- A word: --


So fair, and so unkind! -- Sure Nature dotes,
She twists such contradictions, or what is worse,
Has lost her wits, and would have all, like her.

Whence this new fury? --


Can you read your self,
And ask that question? Were you made thus lovely,
To make me miserable? -- Would you would less
Divinity, or more Humanity.

Then you're in Love it seems? Or at least would
Make me believe it: -- Don't I know, you Men
Speak anything? -- Women are fools, and cannot
For shame, but credit it: --

You wrong my Truth:
By all that is good. --

No more: -- Admitting yet,
What I can scarce believe; -- Why must you crop
That flower, which as it grows, may peradventure
Look fair, and lovely, but, once gathered, withers?
Give me a Love refined; A Love, that flames
Upon it self, not fed with grosser fuel;
A Love, that loves the Virtue, not the Sex.

And such is mine: -- But fancy not this new
Philosophy of immaterial flames;
Hearts may meet Hearts, and Souls, piquere with Souls;
But if they come no nearer than the Eyes,
For want of matter to maintain 'um, dye.

Be judge your self: -- Who but the needy pray?
Once fill your belly, yo've no more to say,

Yes -- to give thanks, and ruminate upon
Those blessings, which grow faster, than we reap um:
Come, come, be wise, and trifle not away
That youth, would make an Emperor too happy;
All seek their like; And like the Needle, tremble,
And never settle, till it reach that North:
I Would rather be an Owl, than Phaenix,
If I must live alone: --

These Morals Sir,
Might have been better spent; But since you will needs
Make me believe you love me -- Court my father;
For, notwithstanding the Respect I bear you,
I must declare. I Have neither eyes, nor ears,
To any thing, but what he shall direct.

You need say no more: -- Mind what I told you, and leave the rest to me.


Sure my father went to Heaven, I am so unfortunate; -- Well; be it as 'twill,
I love you; and were I to speak seven year, I could but say the same thing. --
Come -- I Will wait on you


I Cannot away with it; -- unfeignedly, I cannot. -- A man may profess; it is
lawful -- Yea, assuredly it is; And therefore I say, I profess, If any of my
flock, shall so much as straggle into his pastures, I say, I profess, I shall
not only turn them out of my fold, for rotten sheep, but they shall for ever be
to me, as Publicans; That is to say, As the Learned have most ingeniously
observed; Publicanus, quasi, publicus canis


Why good Mr. Scruple -- A Member should not be cut off for one failing.


Good me no goods, Good Mrs. Whitebroth; -- I tell thee here (sister of mine)
it is a wilful failing; -- A very wilful failing


For why I pray? -- The man is learned: -- I am sure he told me all my
Husband's distemper, before he so much as saw him


Told ye! -- I, there is the point -- And I must tell you too, he must needs use
some unlawful means


Alas -- It cannot be: -- His Wife (good woman) is one of us; And do you think,
if he were such, he would ever sufferit


Why there is the blind: -- The woman, is a good sisterlie woman, and an often
frequenter; which, he allows of, only to deceive the World, as if he were --!
Well -- well -- Mark what I say -- If he has not made some secret, express
contract, with Satan, I Will be your Teacher no longer; -- If you had ever read
Doctor Faustus, this would not be so strange to you


Now goodness defend it!


Come, come, -- It Is great pity, it is not looked into: -- I dare undertake,
had this Fellow set up in Spain, he had been in the Inquisition long ere this
-- But we; The more light we have, the less we see; -- We are wilfully,
stiff-neckedly blind; Indeed we are


Be not too rash: -- Many a good body's wronged, or many of our Brethren, and
sisters, are not what they should be


Yes -- That was always the malice of the Devil, and his instruments; -- But
this Fellow, is a professed Reprobate; -- I have read his Bills, and spoken with
several, that have been with him, And they tell me, he has a Globe, ever
standing upon his Table, and never answers any question proposed, without first
turning that; -- And why may not the Devil be in that Globe, as well as in the
Pummel of Paracelsus's Sword, and Dr. Dee's Crystal? -- D' you mark me that
Gentlewoman? -- Answer me that


Nay, pray Mr. Scruple -- I must go: -- All that he told me, was without his
Globe: -- I mean no hurt


That may be something in the case: -- Let me see -- what say the Casuists? --
If any thing help you, it must be the intention; And that, we are forced to
make use of in many cases; especially, such as we cannot hinder, and correct
the viciousness of the means, by the purity of the end: -- For example now --
If a Woman, great with Child, long for another man, besides her Husband, and
this Husband will not give consent; In this case we say, (and so we generally
agree) that she may follow her natural inclination; Provided always, she have
no intention of sin, but only to satisfy her longing; -- For, Actus, non facit
reum, nisi men's sit rea: --


Now blessing on you good Sir -- I always thought so.


In like manner -- If a young woman, of a godly Parentage, do fall into a holy
Fornication (not out of Lust, but Love) and thereupon prove with Child; In such
case we say, That it may be lawful to procure Abortion, provided always, it be
not done, with an intention of Murder, but only to save Life, or Reputation: --
Nay further, lest the Profession should be scandal'd by it; we hold it better,
to trust Providence, by forswearing the Fact, than to fall into the hands of
men, by confessing the infirmity of the flesh: -- And in this (as many other
things) we agree with some Gentlemen ^broad; And truly, where we do differ, the
difference between ^s, is so fine, and nice, we can hardly perceive it our
selves: -- There is (as the Schoolmen term it) an Identificadunity of
Principles, common to us both. -- They have their private shrifts, so we: --
They call it a venial sin with a sister, and in case of necessity can forgive a
Neighbors Wife, so we: -- They allow regulating by Tumults, so we: -- And
lastly, They deny all this in plain words, but grant it in effects, so we


But what is this to me? -- May not I go? -- Good Mr. Scruple.


If your intention be right, you may: -- However, for fear of the worst, I will
go with you; I should be loath to lose one of the best sheep in my flock, for
want of a little care: -- Come Mrs. Whitebroth, I did not think to have done so
much; -- But you have such a winning way with you -- Such a power upon me, I
can deny you nothing -- Indeed I cannot: -- Come -- We must now and then comply
with one another weakness.


It Is a good hearing Sir: -- I thank you.


COme Gypsy; -- How came you tolight on this house? -- It Is a rare convenience.


Oh! she is our Midwife.


And faith, they are good necessary things; and generally tractable, before
they grow rich


How do you know? -- I never met you here before.


Time enough now.


But pray Major, is this Gentleman married?


Hang him Rogue; -- Every man's Boots serve his turn.


And better so, than going barefoot: -- I am not married (sweet Lady) but a
Lover still


A pretty Gentleman.


He was, you would have said, had you known him, when I knew him first: -- But
now --


As good as ever my Girl: -- Dear Mopus!


Away Captain: -- You do so mousle one.


Nay, have a care of him -- I say no more.


Marry -- I hope you are not in earnest.


And thou have no more wit, than to believe him! As sound as a Bell wench -- As
sound as a Bell.


Indeed Captain, I hope the best: -- But sure there is somewhat in it, he does
not fine up himself, as he was wont


I seldom regard fashions -- Any thing serves me; -- Drape de Berry in the
Summer, keeps out the heat; and Stuff in the Winter, lets it in: -- I must
confess, I have three or four as rich Suits, for Flanders Lace, Gimp, and
Embroydery, as any in the Town


But where are they good Captain? Where are they?


Why faith, I have had'um all in my head, this Twelvemonth, but could never yet
get one of 'um upon my back


Troth Captain, 'twould not be amiss at this time, if you opened your head, and
took one of 'um out


The Jade's too hard for me: -- Hark you: --


O good Captain -- It must buy the Child a new Coat.


Hang him Brat; -- One of thy old Petticoats will serve: -- Bestow money upon
Puppy-Dogs


You always serve me thus: -- Pray Captain -- Give me some often again.


Not a Cross by this good light; -- D' you hear me?


And must thy Major have no Hatchments? -- 'Prithee disburse, disburse; -- Dear
Landlady: --


Indeed I have no money: -- One would think your Meat, Drink, Lodging, Washing,
and Wringing, were worth somewhat


Irish Beef, By this good Tilbury -- Nothing but Sheeps Heads, and Irish Beef.


It Is but too good for you, unless you were more thankful: -- Many an honest
Gentleman would be glad of your Orts


'Prithee -- My best Landlady: -- Let the small Gem, or the superstuous
Petticoat march


I will not always endure this; -- For once -- But shall we be merry then?


As merry as thou will my Joe: -- Hang pinching, we'll never pine our selves,
though our Heirs smart for it


Here Major -- Here Is an old Elizabeth, has not seen light these seven years.


And even let her go -- She has been Prisoner long enough of all conscience: --
Come Captain, let us be merry


By this hand it is true: --

I love thee above all flesh alive: -- Fear nothing -- All Is well, and as right
as my Leg


And that is crooked to my knowledge.


Nay good Sir; -- You do but jest?


Hang him -- Hang him -- I have said enough -- And now I Am for you: -- Be true
Cuckolds, Be true, Be true, etc


Hoop Holyday! -- That Is old.


You are for new faces too! -- Pray Major, Will you oblige this Lady?


Who I? -- With all my heart -- But I Have got so strange a Cold, and drunk so
much French Wine of late, that (by this old Companion of my side) 'twill be but
once removed from howling


However -- Pray venture -- I never knew a good voice, without an excuse: --
Pray try


My Landlady might command me any thing -- But I Am so out of Tune -- Ta -- La.
La. La. -- Hanged


Let him alone, and you will not be rid of him -- He Is like the blind Beggars of
Bolonia, a man must give 'um a Halfpenny to sing, and Twopence to hold their
tongues


Come give me the Wench that is mellow;
And a Pox take all Fools that are yellow:
It Is the Horn, the Horn,
The advancing of the Horn,
Dubbs a Cuckold, an Aldermans Fellow.
Let no man disorder his rest.
By believing Bulls feathers in's Crest;
When yo've said what you can,
A Cuckold, is a man,
Or most of our Fathers were Beasts.
Then let us sing At it, and At it;
And let every one catch, that car
All Opinions agree,
In one of these Three,
The Horn, the Pot, or the Plaquet.

La' you now -- Did not I tell you as much? -- I Will have my Pipes cleared,
against we meet next


But when shall that be?


When you will, provided it be for all Night, and out of Town.


That Is impossible.


Not at all -- You may leave word, you are gone to a Woman's Labor.


Hah! Hah! -- But her Husband --


What?


-- Will discover the contrary.


Puh -- Puh! -- Never let that trouble you: -- His knowledge, does not lie that
way: -- You know Captain, I have slipped a man into his Tables ere now, and he
not a farthing the wiser


I that thou have, I Will be sworn.


Come, come, let us in, and discourse it further: -- A Bottle, and a Fiddle; and
then, Good Night


A match, a match: -- Lead up before Major.


W(...) you of it? -- She is a handsome Gentlewoman, and her Fathers Heir.


Think, do you say? -- I Will promise you, my stomach wambles at her already.


Leave it to me: -- I will not do with you, as I do with my Clerk, Snip
half-profits -- But you know Sir -- Somewhat ought to be done -- Danda est offa


Whatever you please Sir: -- If this take, I will down into the Country, get
me an able Clerk, and turn Justice of Peace


And so you may: -- The Alderman is gone to take the Air, and ten to one but
he makes this way homeward; I did once at distance, propose such a thing, and
now I perceive you relish it, I Will present you to him: -- But to pass the time
till he comes -- You say you are a Bachelor of Law, I Will try your wit: -- I
have a Case here, referred to me, pray observe it, and give me your opinion
in it; -- I take it, it runs through the whole 24 Letters: -- These common
Lawyers, are our younger Brothers, but they have given us the start; They never
let any thing come to us, but what they can make nothing of, themselves


Pray Sir let me hear't.


You shall -- It Is thus. Abigal, a feme sole, seized in tail, of the Manor of
Blackacre, makes a Feoffment in Fee to Cuttbeard, upon condition, that if
Daniel, shall release Emanuel, of, and from all Actions relating to Ferdinand,
that then Gregory, shall satisfy Humphrey, of, and for all Marriage-portions,
intended by Jeromy, to be given Knipperdoling, with his Wifes daughter Lettice;
which, Maximilian perceiving, and believing that Nicholas, had a more than
ordinary influence, upon Oliver, procures Peter, to discharge Quintilian, and
engage Rowland, to estate his Wife Susan, in the capital Message of Toungwell
(with a certain Salt-marsh, and Underwoods, thereunto belonging) and stop his
daughter Urselas mouth, with a Windmill, and a Water-mill, left her, by her
Mother; whereupon Winifred, having lately recovered in a praecontract, against
Xenophon, makes a Lease to Younker, who releases to Zachary, who enters upon
Abigal, who reenters upon him, and ejecting him out of the Premises, burns
his principal Evidences. -- And now Sir, What think you? -- Where has this man
his Remedy


I should think Sir, he were gone at common Law.


You are always hankering after the common Law; -- How shall we hedge in the
Jurisdiction of 't


Indeed I cannot tell -- But they say, here is a learned Astrologer, that
undertakes to tell such things, by the Stars; perhaps it might not be amiss to
consult him


Hark you -- I dare trust you: -- He knows no more of Law, than you, or I do:
-- Now by my Troth, but it is a difficult Case; and I have given my opinion
in it, both ways -- The Devil is in it, if one of 'um be n't right: -- But, as I
told you, the Alderman: --


How do you say it was?


Why thus, an't please you: -- I had (according to the duty of my office) just
walked my Round, when lo! About the first of the morning, we perceived a kind
of glimmering, as of Guido Faux's Lanthorn; And we said unto it -- Stand -- And
what art thou? And what means that light, at this unseasonable hour of the
Night? when presently a voice answered -- Nay, But what are ye? And we said --
The Watch; And to our seeming, it said again -- Harm watch, harm catch -- And
there fell a shower, as it had been of Chamber-pots, and we were most lewdly
bepist, and some Pates broken


A plain case -- The King's Majesty's Authority affronted; in the
representative person, of my Neighbor Double Diligence, the Constable: --
Bring 'um before me, I Will make 'um know, what is what


Will it please your Worship to grant me your Warrant? I had one from
Mistresses Worship, during your sickness, but could make no body obey it


How? -- Not obey her Warrant? -- I Would have 'um to know, she is (in my absence)
as good a Justice of Peace, as my self; Are not Man and Wife, one person in
Law? -- Not obey her Warrant! -- Let me see who dares deny't! -- Come
Neighbor, come -- I smell a Rat; -- What would you say now, if this should
prove, to be a Bull from the Pope? -- I say no more


Save you Mr. Alderman! -- I am glad to see you so well abroad again.


Doctor Runter! My loving Friend, and Neighbor -- Well met.


This is the Gentleman Sir, I told you of: -- He is a thriving young man, and
you may do what you will with him


I shall be glad to be acquainted with you Sir.


I hope the Doctor will oblige me in it.


Methinks the Air is somewhat sharp: -- Come Doctor, Take your friend with
you.


BE pleased Gentlemen, to take a Turn or two, in this Room; -- My father is a
little private at present, with a person of Honor, but will be with you
presently.


Where are we now? -- Nor better, nor worse, but a downright Astrological
Bawdy House: -- The Devil of any thing could I see in to other Room, but two or
three Chairs, broke in the back, half a dozen empty Gally-pots, and a
Deaths-head, between two Syringes


You may guess Forty times, ere you hit so right again: I believe him a better
Artist at Bawdry; than Conjuring


Not a jot the worse instrument: -- Do but hear him, and you will quickly judge:
And if you love me, pray let me manage the Conference: -- He Is somewhat long --
Where is this man of learning?


Here Sir -- A poor old man; -- One or other, will never let him be quiet, till
he is in his Grave: -- Your Commands Gentlemen


Why faith, this Gentleman, and my self, have received so large a character of
you, that we are come to wait on you, in the behalf of a friend of ours


I have done somewhat in my time; and hope I shall never be too old to do good.


You say well: -- There is a friend of ours (that for the present shall be
nameless) has got a small mischance: -- You may guess what I mean


Well Sir -- I apprehend you, and will set him right again.


Then you take it for granted, it must be a Man: -- Suppose it be a Woman? Does
that alter the case


Sir, I Will deal plainly with you -- If your friend be a Man, I Will cure him for
Five Pieces; but if a Woman, I shall not take her in hand under Twenty


Why this great difference?


O Sir, not without Reason: -- The sooner you cure a Man, the sooner you have
him again -- He Is a constant Termor -- But a Woman -- Ah Sir, she brings Grist
to Mill; -- Cure her once, and she grows cunning, you will hardly ever hear of
her more; -- I shall not bate any thing of Twenty Pieces to cure her: But this
I Will do with you, I Will patch her up against Term, for Forty Shillings


Hah! Hah! -- Let this satisfy you, it is a Man: --


Pray do -- And leave him to me: -- And if there be any virtue, in Sassa,
Guajacum, or Turpentine, you need not fear him


A rare Rogue.


Well Sir -- I shall: -- But this is not all our business -- We are well
satisfied, that you are a person of occult learning -- Pray Sir will you oblige
us


You look like Gentlemen, and I am confident are so -- I Will be free with you:
-- I could discover a Secret of Nature to you, and for the expense of a brace
of hundred pounds, put you in possession often: -- It will give you the
knowledge of all things past, present, and to come; And long life, health,
youth, blessedness, wisdom, and virtue, shall be added to it


As Paper, and Pack-thread.


But -- If you should not make a right use of it, by living soberly,
temperately, and enjoying it, as if you had it not; but shall misimploy it, in
swaggering, Gluttony, worldly pride, and sensuality; you shall not only lose it
for the present, but be out of all hopes of finding it again for the future --
And this is that which we call, Our Magisterium, Elixar, or Rosy -- crucian
Pantarva: -- The father of it, is the Sun, the mother of it, the Moon, its
brothers, and sisters, the rest of the Planets, the wind carries it in its
belly, and the Nurse thereof, is the Earth


Pray Sir proceed, and disclose this Son of Gold.


Hermetically, I shall: -- It is situated in the Center of the Earth, and yet
falls neither within Center, nor Circumference; small, and yet great; Earthly,
and yet watery; Airy, and yet very fire; Invisible, yet easily found; Soft as
down, yet hard above measure; Far off, and yet near at hand: -- That, that is
inferior, is as that which is superior; and that which is superior, is as
that which is inferior: -- Separate the combustible, from the incombustible;
the Earth, from the fire; the fluid, from the viscous; the hot, from the cold;
the moist, from the dry; the hard, from the soft; the subtle, from the thick;
sweetly, and with a great deal of judgment, Per minima, in the Cavernes of the
Earth; And thou shall see it ascend to Heaven, and descend to Earth, and
receive the powers of superiors, and inferiors: -- Comprehend this, and be
happy: -- Thou have discovered the Balsom of Sulphur the Humidum radicale of
Metals, the Sanctuary of Nature, and there is little, or nothing, between thee,
and the Mountain of Diamonds, and all the Spirits, of Astromancy, Geomancy, and
Coschinomancy, are at your command


Pray Sir, How call you that? That last again.


Coschinomancy Sir: That is to say, The most mysterious Art, of Sieve, and
Sheers: -- I must confess, I was once of the mind, to have obliged the World,
with a Discourse upon this Subject; but since that, the World, and I, have been
better acquainted, and I find it base, and unworthy


Troth Sir, it is great pity, but you went on; Such a Quixotism in Philosophy,
must needs please every man; for my own part, I date promise you, you shall
want neither money, nor coals, as long as this Gentleman's purse, and mine, can
supply you


Why truly Sir, encouragement may do much: -- I am neither Mede, nor Persian,
upon good demonstrative Reasons, I may be persuaded: -- Goth to all good
Literature, for he deserves no better expressions from me) Dioclesian, burnt
all the Books of this Art, and for no other Reason, but that he feared
(forsooth) they would make Gold too common: A wise Fellow, another Lycurgus, to
avoid drunkenness, cut down the Vines: -- You see by this, he confessed it
feasible.


Sir, I must needs speak a word with you in haste.


Gentlemen, I Will wait on you again, instantly.


By no means -- We shall have further business to you, and will see you again:
-- We follow you.


As ever breathed: -- But to my business: -- I am afraid, I shall want present
money; I could never find any wheels move merrily, without greasing


Nor I neither -- And therefore to prevent the worst, try to get the other 1000
l. of the Alderman; and cross-bite him, with his own money


And that I can; He has offered it me.


And do it: -- If a man must break, a 1000 l. will signify little in the Sum:
-- Come, mind your business, and you cannot miscarry if you would.


I Am glad to see your Worship tread so lusty, and strong again; -- I hope,
you will be the better for it


I Tim. 'Twould have vex'ta man, to have just got an Estate, and strait pipt
over the Perch, e're he had time to look upon it: -- Mr. Scruple put diverse
things, very home to me, and 'twas ten to one, but all had come out, but that I
thought with myself, there was no such need yet; -- Come Tim. leave that, and
let us see how Affairs stand at present: -- How have you done with your rotten
Raisons -- Did they yield well


Troth Sir, the Wine-coopers have done their part; They have made you at least
60 Pipes of Wine out of 'um -- But they advise your Worship, to get your money
for 'um, before they stir out of your Cellar; for however they may be palatable
enough, as long as they lie there, yet, as soon as you stir'um, they will kick up
their Heels


Good enough to be pist against a Wall, an' they were worse: -- And now I think
on it, you remember the Country Vintner, that bought the Pipe of Canarie on
Shipboard, and gave it the Rascal mark, to cheat the Custom-house -- See it be
Cran'd off into another Pipe, and filled up again, with your New, what do you
call it? -- It Is good enough for sinners; -- If he discover it, you may tell
him, it is his own mark


It shall be done Sir: -- But Sir, Mr. Spendall was to have waited on you
yesterday, touching a Bond of his of 500 l. which he says is paid, and you
promis't to deliver up


O Ho! Let me see -- Here it is --

If the said Spendall shall content, satisfy or pay, etc. Why see -- The
condition of the obligation (which is made for his benefit, and not mine)
says, If he shall content: Pray tell him, (notwithstanding the payment of the
money) his Bond is forfeited; for I am not contented; -- Does he think I can be
content with 6. per Cent? -- I have no more to say to him -- I Will take my
course -- Pray mind your own business -- Have you received the Jews money? and
sent him the Pack of Left Handed Gloves, I order d you


Yes Sir -- It Is done.


Put tricks upon me! -- Make me buy a round parcel of Gloves, and now you know
I have 'um by me, if I will not bate a third part of the money, you have
occasion but for half of 'um, and be hanged: -- I Will Jew you, with a Horse-pox
-- I have received half your money, and you shall have half the Gloves (that is
to say) all the Left Handed ones -- You may chance to truck 'um off, with
maimed Soldiers, if not, I Will make you pay sauce for the other. -- Reach me that
Book -- And while I remember it, go into my Chamber, and upon the Table you will
find a 1000 l. in Half-crowns; Pray weigh 'um, one by one, and lay by such as
are over weight, and see 'um melted down; -- It Is a hard World, and fit every
man make the most of his own: -- Bottomary, upon the good Ship called the Mary,
to be paid with interest, after the rate of 30 l. per Cent. within ten days
after her coming to Anchor in the River of Thames -- 1700 l. -- So, so, That Is
paid, All got; -- She Is sunk at New found-land: -- Besides, I have ensur'd a
1000 l. upon her, my self -- How wealth trowles in, upon an honest man! -- The
Master deserves a 100 l. extraordinary for this, and shall have it; This is the
fifth Ship, he has sunk for me. -- Item, paid the Irish Army, in Peru Dollers
-- I! there is a sweet business! --


Sir, Mr. Afterwitt desires to see you.


Stay him a while without, I Will be for him presently: -- Here Is a Squire too,
will be worth me somewhat: Let me see his account -- Lent his father, upon
judgment -- 4000 l. -- Item -- More upon a Statute -- 3000 l. Item, upon
Mortgage -- 2500 l. -- Item, upon his own Account; upon Bond -- 500 l. -- Item,
more -- 300 l. Item, bound to me for other men -- 1000 l. -- Pox of these
Bonds, I must persuade him to take another 1000 l. and hedge all, into one good
Mortgage: -- To see how this World goes round: -- My Great-Grandfather was a
wealthy Citizen, and left my Grandfather, a Gentleman forsooth! But what
between my Father, and him, they so ordered the business, that they left me,
never a Groat. -- This Fellows Grandfather, was a Law-driver, and swallowed my
Father up; His Father set the Estate a moving, and this, will set it quite
away: -- His first Ancestor, cheated mine, and I hope I shall be able, to
require his love, upon his posterity: -- Thus you see, the wheel comes round,
to the same point again -- This City, is like the Sea; few Estates, but ran
often at first, and will run into 't at last: -- Timothy! Afterwitt! The
welcomest man alive -- You were wont to come and sit with me; But now -- You're
grown such a Courtier, you forget your old friends -- 'On my Conscience you
want money, or I had not seen you now -- Away with it -- It Is all but dirt --
You shall not want 1000 l, as long as I can help you; Nay, 'an twere 10000. to
do you good -- The son of my old friend


I thank you Sir, and shall make use of you; -- But I Will promise you, this was
purely visit.


I am the more beholding to you: -- Hark Tim! Beat out those Rogues -- What
would they have


They are the Waytes Sir -- They bid you good morrow every morning, and are now
come to congratulate your Worships Recovery


I Will give 'um nothing -- They are the cause of more Beggars, and Bastards --
When a man would sleep quietly, they wake him, and be hanged; And then the good
Woman plucks him by the Sleeve, and cries -- Hark Husband -- Hark -- The
Waytes -- Hark! -- Come Mr. Afterwitt, we'll out of the noise; -- It Is as
dreadful to me, as the last Trump.


It Is a fine Child -- I Will try his Wit -- How far have you learnt Youth?


Sententiae Pueriles, Sir.


A good Boy! You may in time come to your Genus, and Species.


I am past that already -- Quae genus, aut flexum variant, quocunque novato
Ritu deficiunt, superantve, Heteroclita sunto


A most emphatical description of us (sister Whitebroth) -- We are a kind of
Heteroclites, and oftentimes saved, even contrary to Rules: -- A witty Child --
Let Us see -- Byssus, Abyssus -- How render you that


Byssus, A bottomless Pit; Abyssus, A more bottomless Pit.


A -- Child, Thou art in the right; There is a Great -- great -- great
Bottomless bottom; -- Indeed there is


Please you to give me leave to ask you one word.


With all my heart Child -- What is 't?


What Is the English of Adolescentior?


Adolescentior! -- Hum! Adolescentior! -- Haw! -- Adolescentior -- I -- That is
as much as to say -- Adolescentior: -- (Now fie Child! Ask questions with that
dirty face! -- Go wash it Child -- Go wash it: -- Fie Child! fie!


It signifies a Ladder; Adolescens, a Lad; Adolescentior, a Lad-der.


I profess, I did not observe it: -- I see a man may live, and learn every day:
-- Go Child, wash your face, and let your father know I am here


Yes Sir -- I shall.


Now indeed Mrs. Whiteborth, this is your fault; -- I am present in body, but
absent in mind: -- I could chide you now -- But I hear him coming --

Did not I tell you of that Globe? -- It Is well I did not venture you, by your
self: -- I Will sist him


Worthy Sir, and you good Madam, most welcome: -- Be pleased to let me know
your Commands, and you shall see, I am so great a Reverencer of your Coat, that
my whole Art shall lie at your feet


He speaks like other men: -- October next, which, the Learned to be the
forerunner of Doomsday, if not the thing it self


You mean Sir, that of the two superior Planets, Saturn, and Jupiter, in
Sagittarius


The same; What may it portend? -- Good; or Evil?


Much good no doubt; --. Wherein, though I dare not be too positive, yet, as
far as Trismegistus, Albohazen, Haly; -- Messahala, Zael, Rabbi Abraham; --
Albubater, Avenezra, Albumacer; -- Guido, Bonetus, Hispalensis, Firmius, --
Alchindus, Proclus, Monteregius; -- Albertus Teutonicus, Averrois, -- And the
most ancient Chaldeans, Egyptians, Moors, Jews, or Arabians, have discourst,
either this, or the like, I shall give you my opinion


I profess, a great red Man!


And here, we are to observe, which of the two Planets, Saturn, and Jupiter
(This, the very best, That, the very worst) is strongest, at the time of his
Conjunction, for according to his nature, will the effects follow


In truth, learnedly -- Pray Sir on.


The last Conjunction of these two Planets, happened --


Pray Sir, no chance, or happening: -- Was, I pray.


Then, Was, in February, 1643, in 25 Degrees of Pisces, a sign of the watrie
Triplicitie (not known in nature before) which produced those monstrous
Actions, not heard of in the World before; And now, forasmuch as this
Conjunction is in Sagittary, the Day-house, and Triplicitie of Jupiter, we may
conclude, it is the more considerable, in regard they have wholly left the
Aquatick Trigon, and will for many Years make their Conjunction, in the fiery
Tranquillity: For when any alteration, from one Trigon, to his contrary,
happens --


Good Sir, no happening -- Let me beseech you -- for look you, d you see, as
this -- Good Sir -- Things come not by hap, or chance


Well, what you please -- It is impossible, but that some admirable effects,
quite opposite to the former, must needs follow: -- And of this opinion, is the
learned Haly, and generally, all the Ancients, and Moderns


But suppose it should be otherwise?


Then we are mistaken; And that is very unlikelie amongst so many learned men:
-- As we ordinarily converse in the world, we may be mistaken; but in Cathedra
(That is to say, our studies) it is impossible


A pretty word for a Study -- Cathedra, quasi Cathedra: -- But pray Sir, what
effect do you conceive, this Conjunction may have, upon the Whore of Babylon


Why truly, that is somewhat uncertain; in regard it will depend so much, upon
that great Eclipse, of Sol, in Cancer, in the house of the Moon, the 22. day of
June, 1666. and will appear, almost Total, at Rome; for my part, I expect, some
or other should marry her up, and make an honest woman of her, or otherwise
(as Mr. Brightman, upon his pair Royal of Sixes, has most excellently
observed) she is likely to get such a Clap, she will hardly claw it off again in
haste


I do profess, you have handled the point, notably -- I am convinced --
There Is (...)il in this Globe


La' you now Mr. Scruple! -- You Will trust me another time, will not you?


Reproach not my good meaning: -- Certainly Sir, you must needs have added
some rare Collections, to your own observation


Yes, I have some Toys (for so the world esteems 'um) however to me, they are
Jewels


As what good Sir?


Many, many -- In particular, a Treatise of the Philosophers stone, written
originallie by Janboshar, Adam's Tutor, whom likewise you find recorded in the
Indian Books, written by Isazarith, about a hundred Years before his time


I thought Letters had not been so ancient.


Alas! There were diverse very good Authors, writ before the Flood; I have some
half a dozen of'um within, if I could tell where to find'um: -- Men of my
profession, cannot well be without'um: -- When I see you next, I Will show you
the very Antographum, by which Seth, drew his Pillars


Yes, that were worth the seeing: -- And now I find you so near the flood, give
me leave to try your learning: -- Give me the exact time, and the language of
that time and I Will say you're a Scholar


For the time; It was (according to our latter computation) the 5th, day of
June, in the 1656. Year of the world, one Month, and 17. days, nor more, nor
less; And by all good Tokens, upon a Friday, Sol in Gemini, the Dominical
letter of that Year, D, fifteen minutes preciselie after Sunsetting


I see, you're very exact.


Alas! We must be so; Half a minutes loss, so maine Years ago, had been the
Lord knows what by this time: -- Then for the language; notwithstanding any
thing that has been said, to prove it High dutch, I am clearlie of opinion, it
was Hebrew, or some other Jargon


Nay there, you must bate mean Ace; for though I look upon it as obscure, as
the head of Nile, yet as far as it may be lawful to pry, into unreveal'd
mysteries, I dare boldly pronounce it to have been, Welsh


Welsh! -- Afedrwch chwi Gymeraege?


Why truly no; But I have a little looked into the learning of the Tongue, and
that for two Reasons: The one, for the honor of my Nurse; for I am to tell
you, I sucked a Welch-nurse, and so by a Synecdoche, Tant -- a -- mount, to all
the Eastern languages, and I Will promise you, as Guttural (that is to say,
Throateral) -- Y Cradog, Crugog, Crogwch, Y Gwan-wr hull fu began (r) hwch


Of My word there is more than Kawse Pobi, in this; -- Pray Sir, how do you
English it


It matters not; Or if it did, it is not the custom; -- But I had almost lost
the Argument, I say 'twas Welsh, and thus I prove it: -- It Is confessed of all
hands, That before the confusion of Tongues, there was but one language; which
being so, it is more than probable, That Gomer, the first Grandchild of Noah,
and first Ancestor of the Welchmen, spoke the same language, that his
Grandfather did, and that from him, by a continued succession, it has been
derived to them: -- For Example; -- Ask a Welchman at this day, what
Countryman he is, he will answer, Cymro glan, A true Welchman; That is to
say, Gomera glan: -- In like manner, for his language, Gymeraege, quasi
Gomeraege, both from Gomer: -- And truly, I take the Cimbrians, to be much the
same; Cimbri, quasi Cambri, quasi Cymri, quasi Gomeri; -- And again, Mumgumry,
quasi Mount Gomery, the very seat, of Gomer himself


This is, Draper, Diaper; Napkin, Nipkin; Pipkin, King Pepin.


Most excellent, I see you have studied Etymolo gy; -- I might yet further, and
(I think) without much difficulty, make it out, That the Mountains of Ararat,
were Penmenmaure in Wales; And the most ancient Egyptians, originally Welsh, as
may be more than suspected, from their Deification of Leeks: -- But I had
rather come nearer home -- What pray, were the Galli Senones, that sacked Rome?
Welchmen, no doubt; The very name speaks it: Gallus -- Guallus, or Wallus -- A
Welchman; -- In like manner, the Gallo-Graecians, under Brennus; The same;
Brennus -- Brenn, or Brenning -- A King in Welsh: -- But what do I go about to
prove that, which no body dares deny? -- I ll give you but one smart parting
blow -- The red streakt Apple, which makes such excellent Sider, what was it
originallie, but the welsh Crab


Sir, you have shown your self a person, of no ordinary learning; And because I
see, you are a virtuoso, Be pleased to walk in with me, and I may chance to
show you some Rarities, not unworthy your perusal: -- And you Madam, if you
have any commands for me, I Will receive 'um there


We'll follow you Sir.


YOu're welcome Sir; And I have heard so well of you, from the Doctor, our
friend, That I Will show you fair Play; -- Catch her, and take her: -- Timothy


Your pleasure Sir.


Go bid my Daughter come hither. --

It Is a good Girl, and will make a good Wife; And I hope, who ever marries
her, will be a good Husband to her: -- She will deserve it, though I say it


Never fear it Sir; If ever I kill her, 'twill be with kindness; -- My mother
would always say,


Come hither Beatrice: -- I am going abroad, and will leave you to entertain
this Gentleman, till I come again


I shall obey you Sir.


Nay to her man; Never fall into the Rear, when you should charge.


I warrant you Sir for one:


What (in the name of Goodness) have we here? -- By my Father's last words, it
should be a Sweetheart (forsooth) -- how it strutts, like a Crow in a Gutter!
-- I have a great mind to hear it speak.


Methinks (Madam) this is a very fine Room.


It cannot be otherwise Sir, while you are in it.


A -- las good Madam -- It Is your Goodness -- Truly -- Pray what a Clock do you
count it


He has a mind to show his Watch; But I Will prevent him:


I have a thing in my Pocket, corrects the Sun.


How do you call it good Sir?


The Vulgar, call it a Watch; but according to the learned, it is a Trochleal
Horadeixe


He that made it, was as little sparing of his stuff, as the other of his
breath, that New-christen'd it, by so stubborn a Name


Will your Ladyship be pleased to accept it? -- I assure you, it is at your
service; It shall be part of your Parafernalia


By no means Sir: -- You speak in Phrase.


Alas (Madam) it is the way of the learned; -- Term, is three quarters of the
Art: -- Here Is this now --


It appears no other to me at present.


Nor yet to me: -- But the word's too common; a Butcher would have said as much
-- Oh no -- It Is a ligneous Pixid, accomodated with two plumbeous Receptacles,
or stanueous Repositories, for Ink, and Sand; -- Or, more Laconically -- An
Escritoire


You're very learned Sir!


Thanks to a good Tutor, some small foundation: -- I must present you something
--


A Suitor say thou! It Is a Puppet: --


You may be too confident Sir.


There --


I shall Sir.


How now? -- Where Is this Alderman? -- What have we got here? A Glister-pipe?
--


Forbear Sir -- Know where you are.


The Hat cost more money, than to be made a Football.


Ha! Reply? -- Madam, your Fan.


Murder -- Murder -- Murder --


Was there ever such rudeness?


Nay -- You shall only stay, to see I am not drunk; -- I thought this, the best
disguise I could use, to keep your father from believing, I made any pretenses
to you: -- Well (Madam) I love you, and you know it; -- You may be proud: --
Farewell.


A mad Wooer! -- However, would my Father liked him.


GOod Mr. Scruple, satisfy my Conscience: -- An Oath adds no legality to the
Action; If I swear to kill a man, must I do it


Why thus: -- Hum -- Haw -- Mas' Andrew, told you, That he came to you with a
Commission, to bid you subscribe, That it was a spiritual Contract in letters
of flesh; and that he came a wooing to you, for him that had commissionated
him, and therefore called upon you, to come, and be handfasted, by subscribing
the Contract? Did I for this, convince you, of the lawfulness of the thing,
and, as it were, compel you to the Wedding? And will you call that Holy
Violence, a Spanish Inquisition? -- Have I done all this? And will you now fall
back? -- Shall our old Lease run out? -- And the Land be sowed with Cockles
again? -- Ah -- Ha --

-- Hui.


This is not the point; -- I cannot deny, but that I took it my self; But then,
was then, and now, is now


Ah -- Be steadfast, and do not believe I speak this out of any particular
Egoitism, or fond Iishness, to my self -- Ah -- No -- This thing of
selfishness, is a very nothingness -- A mere -- mere. -- Ah -- do but consider
it -- (And pray Neighbors there, leave your whispering, and mind the matter in
hand.) -- Hum -- I* say -- Hum -- Do but consider, what acting, wonder-working,
advancing, and Christian-comforting times, these were: -- How the rebuke of the
poor, belied, slandered people, was taken away, and their Reputation cleared!
-- Ah -- Ah -- What great things were wrought upon the spirits of men, even
through the bowels of difficulty! -- Aa -- Antichrist was dying in his limbs,
nay, dying upwards; And this Kingdom that was once so given up to it, that it
was called, The Popes Ass -- Ah -- How was it become (as the Assembly most
happily found it out) the chief of the Ten Horns, that were to gore the Whore:
-- Ah -- Aa -- Good people, do not fear -- There are more Assemblies coming,
and more Purses opening, to carry on, the work -- Aa -- Comfort your selves,
That though these Landdestroying sins of Superstition, Innovation, and
Idolatry, were sins in the Kingdom, they were not sins of the Kingdom; And a
Nation was never destroyed, without National sins: -- Mark that Beloved, pray
mark that: -- Grecian, that when his hands were cut off, clapped hold with his
teeth: -- Ah -- Aa -- Do you but stand in the Gap, and there is a Block in the
way; It cannot be got over; The Nation cannot be destroyed, as long as you are
in it: -- Ah -- Then, do not despond in this day of Trial, this day of treading
down, and not building up -- Aa -- Give not up this Good Old Cause, which you
have so long contended for, with so much precious blood, and so much precious
Treasure -- Aa -- forsake it not, lest the Malignants rejoice, lest the
Malignant, and disaffected, say, You Have fought to much purpose: -- Aa -- Bear
it yet but a little, and you will see Dagon totter, and when he is once running
down hill, he will not stop, till he come to the bottom: --


There, I hold with you, good Mr. Scruple; And the Codes, are of the same
opinion -- Tempori, aptare decet: -- Come let us in, and consult the Form


I am for no Form: -- Yea, I hate the name, I abominate it: -- Forma, bonum
fragile est.


I Will make a Rogue of you, Sirrah!


Why Major -- Nay, good Major -- Have a care.


Thou Son of a Woman; -- Do think men are Bulls, and get their money by
roaring? -- Cheat me of my share, you Dog? --


Nay Major -- Major -- What do you mean? -- Nay -- Nay -- Nay -- Flesh, and
blood is not able to endure this: --


The Rogue's afraid, or he had mischieft me: --


Hold, Major, hold; -- before George, you might have spoiled a man so.


Why Sirrah -- You stinking, lousie, Totterdemallion; you Raggamuffin, Tanarag
Rogue -- Who made you a Captain? -- Was it not I? -- Speak


No troth was it not; -- 'Twas even the Box-keeper of the three Kings, and the
Fleece Link-boyes, made us both: -- You, a Major, and me, a Capitain


Why thou Rotterdam Villain -- Deny it if thou can; -- Did not I pick thee
up, at a three-penny Ordinary, brought you into Gentlemen's company; Dubbed you a
Knight of the Blade; Taught you the method of making new plots, and borrowing
half a Crown of your Landlady, upon the hopes of 'um; And after all this,
signed your Certificate, to make you capable, of those Arrears, you never
fought for; And do you now forget your Patroon, sirrah? Do you forget your
Patroon


And good Major, recollect your self too, if you please -- Do'nt you know, that
I know, That you were never above a Corporal, in all your life; And that too,
not till fighting was quite out of fashion? -- Bow the stick on the other side,
and 'twill be strait


I must kill the Rogue: --

'Twas bravely fought: -- Thou have acquitted thee like a man of mettle? --
Let Us breath


Did not I (if you are yet cool enough to hear truth) teach you, your Top, your
Palm, and your Slur? -- Showed you the mystery, of your Jack in a Box, and the
frail Dye? -- Taught you the use of Up-hills, Down-hills, and Petarrs? -- The
Waxt, the Engraved, the Slipped, the Goad, the Fullam, the Flat, the Bristle, the
Bar; And generally, instructed you from Prick-penny, to Long Lawrence? And is
the question now, Who is beholding


That ever friends, should fall out about trisles!


Agreed -- But hold -- The Devil a Cross have I.


Or I: -- Then knots, and slats -- Our Swords shall serve; -- This knots --
That, slats; -- Joy knots


And I flats; -- 'Twirle up: --


Well -- It cannot be helped -- A man's never the worse man, for a mischance: --
But hark you Captain -- Upon Honor, no talking


No -- No -- No -- First blood, first blood: -- And now Major, you think I
cheated you: -- By this good Morglay! The Rogue was resolv'e to fight, and I
had no reason but to suffer it to be taken up: -- I Will be sworn, I got not so
much, as a Reconciliation Supper by it


This is it, when men must manage their business by themselves: -- All cover,
and all lose: -- You think you are well enough, if you can but say your Gamut
by Rote, though you are not able to prove a Note often: -- Come, come, I must
tell you, there is more required, to be a Rogue, than to say, I will be a
Rogue: -- A man would have thought, one of your Years, and Education, might
have easily guest, who would fight, and who not


Pox on it, it is past: --


Oh Captain, I have been all about to look you: -- Not fighting, I hope?


No -- The Major, and I, have been only measuring blades -- Here Is the
pretty'st thing, you ever handled -- Hey dash -- Toledo, to an inch -- right
Thomas de Ayala; -- Upon my credit, but two of 'um came over in three Ships: --
Do but see how finely it is mounted! -- Sa -- Sa -- Observe -- how true it
bends! -- Ah! for a pass in Flanconade now --


A thousand Froggs.


-- More than I Will speak of; or, to tell you truth, dare: -- But hark you
Squire, have thou any noble Archievements for thy man of Mars? Must the great
Turk dye? -- Speak; -- His breath, hangs upon thy lips


Why truly Captain, I came to ask your Advice: -- I have been most lamentably
abused; Nay, in the presence of my Mistress too


Send him a Chartel Boy, send him a Chartel, and I Will carry it: -- Is he of
mortal Race


Why truly Captain I cannot well tell what he is; -- But this I am sure, he
had a good material hand, and hoof


How Captain! -- This Gentleman is your friend?


He is; And I Am engaged in honor to see him righted.


'Twas bravely spoke; -- And pray think of no Second, but my self: -- Good Sir
--


Then -- So't please you, thus -- I was entertaining my Mistress, with this
little bauble --


It Is somewhat beneath the standard, I must confess: -- But pray on.


-- When of a sudden, a rude, roaring, Roister --


His name good Sir.


Truly I could not learn that: -- It being in the City, it is probable, it was
some Merchant or other, got drunk


Not unlikelie -- proceed.


I say then, this rude Fellow, without scarce saying a word, gives me a good
sound box --


Not to interrupt you Sir -- Was it the Bucketoon, or the Bucketadoe? --
Logicallie, or Rhetoricallie? -- That is to say, with the Clunch-fist, or open
Palm


Why truly, neither: -- But as near as I can remember, it was with the back of
the hand, upon the Cheek; for with the same motion, he struck off my Hat --
Thus Major --


O Ho; -- The De rere main; -- Why then the question will be singlie this --
Whither a blow, with the back of the hand, upon the Cheek, may be called, a box
on the ear; -- For my part, I am clearlie of opinion -- not


To take it literallie, I grant it you; -- But then answer me, whither it were
not a probable box of the ear; I take it, 'twas


So far I agree with you Captain -- But pray Sir, the rest.


Then, as if his foot, had kept time with his hand, he gave me such a kick in
Ano, that to avoid him, I had almost beaten out my brains against a post


This last of the Post, was your own Act, and may by no means be called his: --
However, upon the whole matter, you are wronged, and we'll see you righted


Thank you good Major -- I am beholding to you.


D' you hear me -- Squire -- You see what pains the Major has taken in your
business -- You must present him


It Is my intention -- Pray let us meet here about an hour hence, and we'll
further consider of 't


We'll attend you -- Your servant. --


SO, so, the Trade goes merrily on: -- Let it hold but one seven years, and I
shall go near to fine for Alderman.


O Mopus! Mopus! -- Here Is the Constables wife to have her Fortune read -- She
had a Bastard before she was married -- Has had two Husbands, and one Daughter,
by this: -- One Major Bilboe is her Sweetheart; and I more than believe, our
Alderman has a finger in the pie too.


The Devil's in it, if I miss her Fortune; I shall be Conjurer, whither I will
or no.


Indeed Sir, I have heard, you're a cunning man, and can tell a woman any
thing


Such things have been done, and may again: -- Let me see your hand: --


Now indeed Sir, he is a Constable: -- Bless me!


Your third, shall be very rich; A Common-counsel man at least; and you shall
have Children by him


How many have I had already?


Let me see -- One Daughter -- And no more -- That is -- since you were married.


To see what learning can do!


Ah Mistress; I traveled hard for it -- I have been, where never any man was
before me, or since -- I Will speak a bold word, -- I have been so far, that I
might have put my finger, in the very Hole, where the wind came out; -- And
all this, for a little knowledge


Methinks it is a great deal -- Pray, a little more.


You should have three diseases; -- And if you 'scape the first, and second,
you may arrive to the third: -- You shall bury all three Husbands, and be
very fortunate, toward your latter end: -- You were born -- Cancer: -- And
have received a hurt, by fire -- Hot-water -- Or some other way


Now truly, but I burnt my hand with a smoothing Iron; And all to be scaled my
foot, with taking down the pot one day, when my Maid was gone abroad, with her
Sweetheart


You have a natural mark, before, or behind, or somewhere about you, between
your head, and your heel


That Is more then I know; But I Will have my Husband look, to morrow morning.


You are pretty neat in your house; somewhat nimble, witty, subtle; -- And a
good Bedfellow


Indeed Sir (I know not why) but I Have been told so.


Double-minded -- Often changing your resolution -- Prone to be angry, but
quickly gone -- And now and then, love a bit in a corner


It Is best eating, when one's a hungry.


Your good days, are Monday -- Wednesday -- Friday -- Your evil, Tuesday, and
Thursday -- Saturday, indifferent: -- Your good Fortune lies -- South, and by
Nor'th; and therefore direct your Affairs that way, and place your
Chamber Door, and Bed, to that side


Now beshrew me Sir, but I Will observe your directions.


Once more your hand -- Your Mons Ventris is exalted -- You love -- I marry
that you do


Nay, now Sir! What do you mean? I love nothing, but what all women do -- their
Husbands


Two strange thwarting lines, across the Cingulum -- You have a Sweetheart, or
two, besides your Husband


Who I Sir? -- I Would have you know I am no such: -- I am as honest a woman, as
any in the Parish -- I scorn your words


No doubt of it: -- Let me see how your hand agrees with my Globe: -- He is --
Suppose I should name him to you; -- B-I-L-Bilboe; -- He belongs to the Sword


Oh Sir, have a care -- If my Husband should hear you, he would run Horn-mad,
and knock both our brains out, with his staff of Authority


To show you more of my Art -- You had a Bastard, before you were married --
And there is an old Fellow that haunts you. --


O good Sir -- If you discover me, I am undone.


Sir, there are two Gentlemen below, desire to speak with you.


I Will wait on 'um presently. --


If you should betray me now: --


I will not -- I will not: -- But hark you -- Upon condition still, you give
me a bit too.


O Sir, it is impossible -- Your wife's in the other Room -- The Gentlemen stay
for you below -- Somebody's coming up -- Mrs. Mopus -- Mrs. Mopus!


Hang her Jade --


See -- See -- See -- In Faith Mr. Doctor! -- Is this your living soberlie,
temperatelie, and enjoying it, as if you had it not?


Is this your Magisterium -- Elixar -- or Rosy Crucian -- Pantarva? -- No
firrah -- The father of this is the Devil, the mother, his Dam, its brothers,
and sisters, the Tribe of Whore-hoppers, the wind carries it, from Bawdy house,
to Bawdy House; and the Nurse thereof, is a suburb Tantrum


A plague of this Boy -- Undone for ever! --


Are you so hot? -- I Will cool you: -- D' ye hear me -- give the next Porter
half a Crown, and let him fetch Double Diligence the Constable -- I am
mistaken, or the woman we found here, was his wife


Keep him in the mean time.


I warrant you, he stirs not.


Gentlemen -- Good Gentlemen -- As you are men -- You undo me for ever --
Study wherein I may serve you


Stay a little --


Nor would I, by my good will, deal with other; -- Do you take the wise men,
and give me the fools, and then see, who will have the most practice: -- There
are but two sorts of people in the World, Aut qui captant, aut qui captantur;
-- Aut Corvi qui lacerant, aut Cadavera, quaelacerantur; which, the great
Albumazar, has most significantlie rendered, by Cheators, and Cheatees -- If it
were not for fools Sir, how should Knaves live


An ingenious beginning; If it hold, much may be said.


You are Gentlemen; -- And I see, understand -- I Will be plain with you --
Examine the World, and you will find three quarters often, downright fools; And
for the rest, six parts in seven, are little, besides band, and beard, and yet
they make a great bussle in the World, and pass for shrewd men: -- And can you
blame me then? -- Did you ever hear a Fish-wife cry stinking Makarel? Or a
Citizen, gum'd Velvet? -- No -- The best in the Town, though the worst in his
Shop: -- Here, we have a learned consultation, whither my Lady may eat Butter
with her Eggs, or have her Posset turned with Lemon, or Ale: -- Yonder, another
keeps a sputter, with his New -- New -- New -- The Wall-ey'd Mare, and the
crop't slea-bitten -- A Book with a hard Title -- A new found language in
Ireland -- Turk, and Pope -- The Flesh-office -- My Ladies Dog -- The safest
way of cutting of Corns -- A bag of Writings -- A house of the Bank-side -- The
Christning of another Turk -- A Franciscan Proselyte -- Gentlemen-ushers, and
Maidservants -- Dentifrices, and Lozenges: -- Another, dawbs you whole
Volumes, with the difference between sufficient, and efficacious: -- Another,
whither the lining of Aaron's Ephod, were Sky-colour'd, or Seagreen; And hack,
and hew so desperately about their Goats wool, a man would bless himself to
see such piles of elaborate Nonsense: -- And now Gentlemen -- Am I the only
man in fault? -- The worst you can say, is, The people, have so little wit, as
to give me money; and I, am so mad, as to pocket the injury: -- Does this
satisfy


Rogue enough -- But is it not possible to make thee honest?


Try me -- I have a Wife, and three Children: -- The Devil take my Wife, and
two of them, if ever I fail you


A safe wish -- But suppose I should order it so, that a young Lady come to
you, could you so read her fortune, as to make her marry me? -- You know how
to play your part, if you please


And if I don't, to your advantage, Cut my throat.


He must know it at last -- I had as good tell him the person.


So you may; -- And do.


Hold up thy hand -- To make thee honest, here is twenty Pieces for thee; and
if thou do the business, I Will give thee two hundred more; -- What say
thou


If I betray you, or do not my best, be seven years in killing me.


You know Alderman Whitebroth?


Know him? -- Why -- I am his Doctor.


It Is his Daughter -- You know your work.


And if I don't do it -- I Will run my Country: -- And now Gentlemen, you shall
say I am honest -- You observed the woman, that was here when you came in


Yes, what of her?


Why -- She is the Constables wife, whom (to be short) the Alderman Cuckolds.


Ha! Are you sure of it?


By the help of this Globe, I made her confess, That the Alderman, and one
Bilboe, play Level de coile with her: -- But (I may tell it you now) my wife,
gave me the first hint often


Hah! hah! -- Thou art honest: -- Bilboe -- A Hector -- He lies in the
Constables house


The same: -- Make the best use of it you can, and I Will promise you, to follow
your directions


This was better than wish -- Come, We'll lay our heads together, and you shall
hear of us again suddenly.


WAs he so drunk do you say?


As ten thousand Beggars.


So, so; -- his money is jogging already: -- Alas Mr. Runter, you hear what he
says -- He was drunk


Indeed Sir, I was never but half so bad, in all my life, and then, I was
Maudlen, for a whole Month after


And well it became you -- Compunction is good Timothy.


What say you Sir -- Mr. Tyro is a civil, hopeful Gentleman, and I am sure,
loves your Daughter


Nay speak to her -- there she is.


Love me! -- It Is more than ever he told me yet.


He is a littlemodest -- Ingenui vultus puer, ingenuique pudoris. Truly I
think you could not have chosen better


I chosen Sir! -- You will not persuade me I hope, that I am in love? -- If I
am, I can assure you, it is not with him


How Child! -- Not be ruled by your father? -- Indeed Husband, it would be
worth your while, to have an eye upon her


And your own too, good Wife.


It should be both your care -- You must provide a Husband for her in time, or
she will provide one for her self


Come, leave this discourse to another time; you know we have business.


What pity it is, that this Mounsieur Le Coxcomb, Tyro, should have my young
Mistress -- A fool, that knows not the use of money, but to play at
Bob-fatthing, and Span-counter: -- Afterwitt has most right to her, for his
Estates sake -- Come, come, he is a Gentleman, and if things hit right, -- Thou
shall have her Boy


ALas Major! Your Arm in a Scarf?


Why faith -- A small badge of Honor; -- And I was dressed up in haste, that I
might not fail you


How was it good Major?


Nothing, nothing, but a small brush about the wall; and I know not why, but I
fancied he might be the person that had affronted you: -- To be short, he made
me this pass, in second, and I returned it so nimbly in Tierce, that I made
the Sun, shine clean through him


Lightning by this hand -- Lightning -- Well --


Uh -- Have a care Captain.


-- Go thy ways -- And if thou take a swing in Quart for it, there hangs as
brave a Fellow, as has hung there these forty years


No murder I hope good Major?


Let him look to that -- I neither know, nor care. -- Do not be troubled Boy!
-- I have an Arm yet left to fight thy Battles


I thank you Sir -- Be pleased --


O Sir, -- your love --


Never doubt him Squire -- I Would as liefe have him upon his stumps, as twenty
others upon no legs


Well Gentlemen, Courage -- For my own part, I fear no flesh alive -- No upon
my life and soul don't I, and I believe the the same of you -- You may fight,
you are men of the Sword: -- But for me -- A man of the Law! -- How say you
Captain


By no means Squire.


Say no more -- He Is dead.


Nay good Major have a care -- No more murder.


What you please -- I Will promise you, I Will use him the better for your sake.


See Captain -- This is he.


Pray Sir withdraw, and hazard not your self: -- It may prove dangetous.


I have out-staid my time --


Look upon the Dyal.


It wants a Gnomon.


Hold thy Death-threatning hand -- He is a Captain -- Let him dye fairlie: --
You do well to presume upon this Scarf -- I have not been wont, to see such
things, and carry my hands in my pocket: --


Thou art not mad man? -- Hold.


The Rogue has affronted me, for speaking kindly to him -- Be quick -- And let
me know the cause, or I Will nail thee to the ground, for an example to others


You have injured a worthy friend of ours -- Squire Tyro.


If that be all -- Rise -- There Is your Sword.


By no means Sir --


Major Bilboe I think.


The same Sir -- I should know that face too! -- Certain Sir, I have had the
honor, to be drunk in your Company ere now


And not unlikelie -- We must not part with dry lips, now; -- Afterwitt -- Our
friend -- Do not remember, we were merry together, at --


Oh -- Your servant Sir;


Come -- All friends -- Well Major (to renew our acquaintance) I have the best
humor for you -- 'Twill get you the Pence, and all of us, mirth


And what may it be?


Dismiss your friend to the next Tavern, and I Will tell you.


Methinks, I find a dislocation in my Crupper; -- Your servant Gentlemen.


Your servant you Rogue -- Your servant: -- Now Sir, your Commands?


To the point then -- If you are honest to us, it may be worth you 500 l. -- If
not, we are two to one, persons unstained in our Reputation; and if we deny,
your affirmation, will signify little -- Will you be trusty


As steel my Boy -- What is 't?


You lie at Double Diligence the Constables house?


I do -- What then?


And now, and then (for diversion) with your Landladie?


No wounding of Reputation, good Gentlemen: -- She Is a pretty Flie-boat, two
men will not sink her


Nor three, I warrant you.


It may be not -- Have you a mind Gentlemen?


O -- No Sir -- I hope, Alderman Whitebroth visits you pretty often?


For his Rent, or so.


Then we, know more than you -- He has a lick at her too; -- Will you assist us
in a design


By the faith of a Soldate, and a man of Arms, I will.


To engage you then, here is twenty Pieces for you -- You must Trepan him with
the Constables Wife; -- If you find her shye, you may bring in her Husband for
a share -- My Neck on it, you square him out of a 1000 l. at least -- He Will do
any thing, rather than have it known


Do It? -- I, and thank you too -- The Bed-pad, is the safest Pad; -- Here Is my
hand, I Will be honest to you


Well, see you are, and let us hear from you again, as soon as you can -- In the
mean time, do you two go to the Captain; -- You know whither I am going; --
Farewell.


THat I could meet with Mr. Afterwitt now; -- He Will never get such another
opportunity -- And at home, it is vain to think it.


Oh! Cis! -- Well met -- It Is my good Girl.


Nay pish -- Stand away -- Come; -- Do what you will, but don't you rumple my
Handkercher


Alas poor thing -- I warrant, you much-minded, what I spoke to you of last: --
Have you ever said any thing to your Mistress about it


Yes that I have -- And she likes him well enough; -- But she will never
marry, without her fathers consent -- She loves him well, but her fathers
Estate better


A good crafty wench -- Let us but secure her, I Will warrant her the Estate: --
And if thou do it Cis -- I Will promise thee a good portion, and a better
husband


What would you have me do?


Lose no opportunity of commending Mr. Afterwitt to her: -- A Gentleman -- A
fine man -- A handsome man -- A proper man -- And you dare warrant, a good
woman's man: -- And hark you, you may tell her, how Tyro, had hired a couple of
Fellows, to Hector him, and that he came off bravely: -- And all this for he


Ineeed Sir, I will not fail you in a tittle.


But were 't not possible, to get her to Mopus's, to have her fortune read?


Suppose I should? -- What then?


The work were done.


Then trouble not your self -- She made me steal out before, and is just
following me to that purpose: -- But hang him; -- He knows as much as my Horse
-- I had almost told her, how Tim. and I cheated him, with some dead Ale in a
Urinal, instead of my Masters water; but that Mr. Scruple, and my old Mistress,
have so cried him up


Have a care of stories -- They may spoil all -- The Fellow is ignorant enough,
there is no doubt of 't -- But yet as long as they believe him knowing, will be
easily able, to do my friend's business; -- 'Prithee desire her to make him
show her, her husbands face in a glass; -- Doubt nothing, but follow your
instructions -- I must to Afterwitt, and let him know, whither his Mistress is
going


Well -- Trust to me -- Be gone -- I hear her coming.


O Cis -- I am stoll'n out, with much ado -- Shall we go? -- What do think
of him


Truly, I take him for a huge cunning man -- He has told, all the Maids of the
Parish, the strangest things! -- And they say, can show one, ones Sweethearts
face in a glass


If he can do that -- I Will believe him -- I am so strangely troubled with
dreams, it passes --


And so have I been too -- And thought several times, to tell you of a strange
thing in our house, but that I was afraid, you would laugh at me


But tell me -- What was 't?


Why last New Years Eve, when all the house were in Bed, I swept up the Hearth,
and smoothed the Ashes, and next morning, found the print of a Wedding Ring,
and a Grave upon them -- I am confident we shall have a Wedding and a Burial,
out of our house this year -- My old Master dye, and my young Mistress married


Away fool -- If I marry -- I promise you it shall not be Tyro -- It Is such a
piece of Ginger-bread


Marry hang him -- It Is all the News, that he hired a couple of Fellows, to
murder Mr. Afterwitt; But he has paid 'um, to the purpose: -- And they say, the
quarrel was about you


Then in short time I shall be Town-talk, and work for Knights Adventurers: --
I should be sorry, he were hurt: -- I would -- But come, I long to hear, what
this Fellow will tell me.


MAkehaste -- I left 'um coming --


Then do you step into the next Room -- And when you hear me cry -- Jubeo --
Take the small stool in your hand, and come in, and stand upon it behind her
Chair, and look upon the glass -- But be sure, when you have done, to take the
stool away with you


I must be gone -- I have appointed Runter -- Have you prepared the Aldermans
Dose


It Is here --


Sir, there is a Gentlewoman or two at door, desire to speak with you.


Desire them to walk in: -- Here, here -- This way -- And you there: --


I have heard my mother so talk of you, I could not be quiet, till I came to
you too


I am nor wont to make my Art common -- But do you propose what you will, and
I Will do my best, to resolve you


Then truly Sir, I have been extremely troubled with dreams, and would fain
know, what they mean


And shall (Madam) if Art can do it -- Dreams, are certain motions, or fictions,
of the Soul, signifying, some good or evil to come; wherein notwithstanding, we
chiefly regard, how the Moon stands affected: -- What were yours


Methought, my father was chosen Lord Mayor, and that Cis, and I, were pounding
Spices, to make an entertainment -- And at last, methought, we fell together by
the ears in our smock sleeves


For the first, 'twas an ill sign -- A sign of your fathers death -- For Death,
is like the Mayor of a Town within his own Corporation; Subject to none, and
has no Companions: -- Then, as to your pounding of spices -- That betokens
Matrimony -- For the Pestle, represents the man, and the Mortar, the'woman: --
Lastly, as to your fighting -- Infalliblie the same; And that, the rather, the
persons being stripped, as you say they were: -- Have you more


Yes Sir -- Methought I was married to a man, with a great Jolt-head.


A sign of Dignity: -- If there had been a brazen face to it, the better; for
it is the first step to it


There were diverse others -- But I have forgot 'um; Pray be pleased to give me
some general hints, that I may the better observe' um for the future


Any thing (good Madam) to serve you: -- To dream of loss of eyes, betokens
help; For most men help the blind; -- If but one eye, but half of what was
expected: -- For a married woman to dream of beheading; Loss of her Husband; --
To a Maid; Loss of her Maidenhead: -- Of Leeks, and Cheese; that she shall
marry a Welchman; -- Of hanging; Matrimome; for they both go, by one destiny


Pretty indeed -- Pray Sir some more,


To dream of loss of fingers, betokens, want of employment, to a Lawyer; -- Of
broken Pates; good luck, to Chyrurgions: -- Of cutting high Capers, hanging, to
a Thief: -- Of a Midwife; revealing of secrets: -- Of Grass-hoppers, and
Crickets; more words, than performance: -- Of a Post, and Pillars; a Mayor, and
Aldermen: -- Of a Calves head, and Purtenants; a Foreman, and his Fellows! --
Of being a Bed with a handsome Lady; ill luck, because it is not true: -- Of
having a true friend --


I, What sign's that?


A sign he is mistaken: -- But enough of this -- Good Madam, your hand.


Here -- And pray tell me my Fortune.


I cannot make it better, or worse; But such as it is, you shall know
presently. --


What think thou of him Cis?


No doubt but it is all true. -- They say, he can show ones Sweethearts face in
a glass; good Madam remember to try him


You shall have a Husband, in a very short time: -- As to his person -- He is,
etc.


But does he love me?


I am sure he does -- And without him, you will be very unhappy: -- He is a most
excellent person -- He receives his knowledge, from Mercury, in Virgo -- His
compleatness of body, from Caput Draconis, in Gemini -- Saturn and Venus, in
Libra, direct him to the light of nature -- Fortuna Major, and Populus, figures
of Geomancy, give him health -- And Puella, befriends him: -- Mars in Cancer,
is his Enemy -- Jupiter in Capricorn, somewhat uncertain, and two Ideas of
Geomancy, conspire against him -- But he shall receive Treasures from the Sun,
and Jewels from the Moon, and his Guardian Angel shall defend him, and make the
spightful Dragon, bite his Tail, in Sagittarius, because he cannot be revenged
of him


But is it not possible to see this excellent person?


It Is a thing, I rarely do -- I seldom practice beyond the stars -- But if
you will promise me to sit quiet, and not talk it abroad, I will for once, show
you the height of Art


Well Sir -- I promise -- But pray, no noise.


No -- He shall rise with Music: Boy --

My glass; And the enchanted Chair:


Oh -- Good Sir have a care!


Be still -- The Spirit knows my meaning, and I dare not baulk him: -- Fear
not, you are as safe, as if you were in your fathers house: --

Now Madam, you have seen the Ne plus ultra of Art; And if I might advise you,
I would have you complie with your destiny; -- without it, you will be
miserable


And perhaps with it: -- Do you know the Gentleman?


I never saw him in my life, till now -- But, methought, he had a promising
aspect, and agreed in every thing, with what I told you before -- Do you know
the face


Yes -- And if my father were consenting to it, it should be the first thing I
would


I can but wish you well -- Yet one thing I Will do -- it is yet in my power -- If
you have no mind to him, avoid seeing him, before you have slept, and let me
know it, before Sunrising to morrow, and I may prevent it: -- If otherwise,
it is past the Art of man


I thank you Sir -- Cis, What shall I do -- Is there no back way? -- If I can
but miss him now, I Am well enough


Have a good heart Madam -- What must be, will be.


You had best let my Boy conduct you: Boy! Aldermans -- Show it this Lady, and
wait on her, as far as she pleases to command you.


'Twas well contrived -- Your servant.


I Thought what you were -- Is this your going to Repetition? -- I Will tell my
Landlord


Indeed I could not help it -- I could never be rid of him -- But I am sure, I
always loved you best -- I hope you will not undo a woman


Nay -- Nay -- That Is nothing to me -- I am resolved -- Unless you engage to do
one thing


Any thing good Mr. Bilboe, that I can -- What is it?


When will the Alderman be here?


At Night, after the Watch is set -- What then?


Why -- You must join with me to Trepan him, -- It may be worth us a 1000 l.


It Is impossible -- No one will believe him to be such a man.


They Will never know it: -- He Will be hanged ere he let the business come upon
the stage


I Will never yield to it: -- You shall have what money you will --


Hang money -- Fly Brass, the Devil's a Tinker.


Yes -- After you Major -- I have done it forty times.


Why how now man? -- Melancholy? -- Thou look as if thy head were full of
Accounts


And truly you are right -- I was just considering how to patch up my Account
with Mr. Alderman -- Indeed he ties me to hard meat -- I cannot take a Rat, but
he makes me account to him, for half-profits; and yet, I allow him as good as
40 l. a year, for the keeping of one poor Gate; -- Would I were once Overseer
of the Poor, or Churchwarden, there were somewhat to be got by that -- I Am
sure, this will hardly keep life, and soul together


Hang care -- I Will tell thee what -- Thou have the honestest woman to thy wife,
this day in the Parish: -- Poor soul, how she is been plagued by this Alderman


Nay Major -- What d' you mean?


She was ashamed to tell you't her self, and would not be quiet till I had
promis't to do it -- This old Goat, is perpetually soliciting her -- Would one
think it? -- Troth I should have guest him fuller of Mercury, than Venus; But
-- A man may be deceived


How! -- The Alderman? -- See what it is to have an honest woman to ones wife --
I warrant you now had she been right, (as they say) she had never discovered
it: -- Now my dear Chick, how I love thee


Leave your slobbering, and consider what to do: -- My advice is, that we
Trepan him -- The Thief is rich, and will bleed well


That would be somewhat! -- But how is it to be done?


He will be here by that time the Watch is set; -- The Captain, and I, will
do it


If we could get a good round Sum between us, 'twould do no hurt -- You may
compound with the Captain for a small matter


Let me alone with him; -- He Is hard at hand -- I Will fetch him; -- Don't you be
out of the way.


Indeed wise, this is a Providence, and may do us good: -- 'Grant we may make a
right use of 't.


Not gone yet! -- I must rattle him: --


Save your good Worship Sir.


Alas Mr. Double Diligence! That you should be thus negligent of the peace of
the Kingdom! -- Don't you know there are a number of dangerous people abroad,
and your Watch not set yet! -- Now truly but you are too blame, and I could
find in my heart to have you complained of


I was just going -- Your Worship sees I am ready.


Pray keep your Watch together, and walk your Round in person -- you cannot be
too secure: -- Here -- Here Is somewhat for your Watch to drink -- I have given
'um nothing a great while


It Is a Four-pence-half-penny Sir -- Will your Worship be pleased to have the
odd halfpenny again


No no -- No matter -- Let it go for a Crust.


We thank your Worship.


I just met my Doctor, and he has given me the rarest Cordial -- Methinks I am
so flippant! -- Now my little Mouse! -- How do you? -- Shall we walk in


Indeed Sir, I am somewhat ill.


'Prithee leave these excuses -- Thou know I love thee.


See Captain -- See! --


Ah the old Rogue!


Come, come -- You must -- I Have had no Rent a good while.


Indeed Sir we have a hard bargain often: -- I hope your Worship will consider us
against next quarter


Why? -- You pay me no money -- You know I take it out, (as they say.)


I but Mr. Scruple's very hard upon my Husband, and will not believe, but he has a
double Lease


I Will order that hereafter -- 'Prithee come -- The Cuckold is secure -- Good
faith you shall


I cannot; -- Nor will I -- Pray unhand me.


How Is this? -- My Landlady! -- Cuckold my honest Landlord! -- Kill him -- Kill
him --


Good Gentlemen -- Spare my life -- Oh -- Oh --


Hold -- Hold -- Better geld him.


Agreed -- Agreed.


O good Gentlemen -- 'Twill break my wifes heart -- Good Gentlemen -- I am an
Alderman


Thou an Alderman? -- I Will undertake he stole this Chain -- Gi'me't. --


Come Brother -- Uncase -- Uncase.


I had forgot my Nightcap -- How now! -- What Is here? -- Stand -- I require
you in His Majesty's Name to keep the peace. -- Stand -- What are you? --
Thieves -- Thieves -- Down with 'um -- Mr. Alderman! -- Alas good Sir, what
makes your Worship in this condition


Landlord -- I am confident this is no Alderman -- The Rogue has served my
Landlady, a man would not serve a Dog so


How! -- Stick a Bulls feather in my Cap! -- Make me a Knight of the forked
Order! -- Is this true Mr. Alderman? Is this true


Failings brother Diligence, failings -- Pray let the business be ended between
our selves, and I will patiently submit to a Churchrebuke


One good Action, is worth two Rebukes, and three Chastisements; -- Pray
Gentlemen keep him here, till I fetch the Watch: -- I will have it recorded to
my own honor, the example of all succeeding Constables, and terror of
Justices, That a Constable once in his time, laid a Justice of Peace, by the
heels: -- I Will be with you instantly.


Good Neighbor -- This will be as great a scandal to our fellowship, as that
abomination of the Elders Maid in Bellyard


Hold Landlord -- Is he an Alderman in earnest?


Yes, yes -- But I Will Alderman him.


By no means -- Stay -- The old Gentleman may take cold -- Pray Sir put on your
Clothes -- 'Twas well I ask't the question -- I would not have it go further
for 5000 l. -- An Alderman


Thank you good Sir -- Pray take up the business.


Come Landlord -- Hanged -- It Is done, and cannot be helped. -- He shall give
you a 1000 l


A thousand pound -- Out upon it --


A 1000 l. Sir -- Alas, I thought 10 l. or so.


How! -- 10 l. -- 'Send we make him accept a 1000. -- It Is a foul business, the
more you stir, the worse 'twill be -- Will you refer't to me? -- I hope to
deserve a 100 l. of you my self


What you will -- But pray beat it as low as you can.


Come Landlord -- What say you? -- The Gentleman's willing to give you a 1000 l.


Oh -- Undone -- I Am a poor man.


Tell me of a thousand pound!


Nay now Mr. Constable, you're unreasonable.


Well then, let him throw in the Lease of my house too -- And (for your sake
Major) I Will do it


He shall -- He shall -- Burn it; -- it is but an old house -- giv't him --
Troth I was afraid we should not have got him so low -- You heard what he said,
'twas for my sake too -- I hope you will consider it


Well -- If it must be so -- No more words often -- I Will end y ou a 1000 l. to
morrow, and conveigh over the house, when you please: -- Oh -- Oh -- An undone
man


In the mean time, a Bond (as you use to say) for mortalities sake, would do
not hurt


What you will -- I must obey.


Be not troubled -- The flesh, was good flesh, and worth the money.


But the sauce though, was Devilish dear.


Hark you Landlord -- Run to your Neighbor Squeeze the Scrivener, for a
couple of blank Bonds -- Make haste -- And when the work's done, we'll drink
abundantly, and remember the Founder


Truly I like it well; -- Exceeding well -- It is good to be thankful: -- Pray
take the Alderman in, and I Will be with you instantly.


NOW you see Madam to how little purpose,
We cross our Stars: --

Had you but mist me now,
I should have ventured that, and perhaps stav'd,
That misery, which always follows rashness.

Trust me: -- I warrant you things will go right:
Now for a small hedge Priest to make the knot,
We'll tie it faster, as we have better leisure.
Keep back a little -- I would not have them see us yet.

Indeed I wont -- You have been large to me already --


Upon one condition I may.


What Is that good Sir?


That you will give me leave to put it in the Diurnal --


I must confess I should be loath to be the Author of so ill a president: -- But
if I should take it; how shall I be able to serve your friend


I have told you.


Hah -- But such an opportunity will never happen.


I am certainly informed he is now upon it: -- For being taken very ill of a
sudden, he has resolved to publish that draught, which you made for him, and
has lain in your hands ever since his last sickness: Now instead of that, let
him seal and deliver this settlement upon my friend, in consideration of
Marriage, with his Daughter, and the work's done: -- Besides, if he should
discover it, I have him so sure upon other Accounts, he dares not mutter: --


You are a notable Gentleman -- You have done extreme prudently, in leaving a
blank for the first words, This Indenture, etc. And that the parchment is plain
at top: -- I will fill it up, with In Nomine Domini, for fear some one may look
over my shoulder while it is doing; when once it is over, it is easy indenting
it, and scraping out, In Nomine Domini; and instead thereof, putting in, This
Indenture made, etc. Trust me with it


Shall my friend depend upon you?


D' you think me a Knave -- A word's enough: -- Yet if you would be ruled by
me, I would advise you to engage Mr. Scruple in the business; He will be able
to do much in it


Will a Parsonage of 300 l. a year do it? -- If it will, my friend has such a
one newly fallen, and given me order (as I see occasion) to present it him --
But do you think he will conform


I warrant you he does both -- Leave it to me to make him -- I must confess he
has been somewhat violent heretofore, but of late, I can assure you, very
instrumental: -- Scruple


And your Worship too: -- I have been looking you every where -- Mr. Alderman
presents you with that health he wants himself, and desires you to come to him,
and bring with you, that draught of his Will, which was engrost when he was
last sick -- I left that learned Artist Dr. Mopus with him, who shakes his
head, and wonders at this sudden alteration -- He says, they drank a glass of
Ale together but few hours before; But truly now, he doubts him


Why? what is the matter?


The Doctor had a hard word for it, but I have quite forgot it: -- He is taken
with a strange scouring, and vomiting: The Doctor knows not what to make of
him: -- Death is in's face


Alas poor Gentleman -- I Will wait on him immediately: -- That things should
fall so cross! -- His Daughter is just married


How! Married? -- I am sure he knows nothing of it -- For his intention of
sending for you, was, That he might so dispose his Estate, that the Court of
Aldermen might not have the fingring of it


It cannot be helped, it is done -- But hark you -- It Is to a worthy Gentleman,
and one that has so great an esteem for you, That having a Parsonage of 300 l.
a year in his gift, and now void, he is resolved to dispose it to no one, till
you have refused it


This is true, I can assure you Sir; And by me, has made the offer to this
Gentleman in your behalf; who, I think, knows me too well, to doubt the truth
of 't


Indeed I do -- I Will take care your Presentation shall be dispatched out of
hand: -- But -- You must Conform


Well -- Well -- That shall break no squares -- 300 l. a year -- I do assure
you, a worthy Gentleman.


He comes himself, and his fair Bride. -- Madam! All Joy.


Of what? -- Will you persuade me into it?


Indeed Mrs. Beatrice, give you much joy -- In truth a very worthy Gentleman --
I am sorry it was not my good fortune to have yoak't you together


Perhaps it may not be too late yet -- You know wise men always marry their
Daughters both ways -- It is not impossible but that Mr. Alderman and myself
may be made friends -- His Daughter is still alive -- How says my Dear


Nay pish --


I shall be glad Sir to be better known to you; And hope my friend has made you
a small Present from me; Had it been better, your worth deserves it


Alas -- Sweet Sir -- I thank your love -- I have accepted That, already -- You
are an obliging person


Come Madam -- You're melancholy -- Be cheary -- All will do well -- Mr.
Scruple; A word -- I think it were not amiss if you went before, and let him
know, I am coming


With all my heart -- Have you any thing further, wherein I may serve this
worthy person, and his Lady


Why truly -- Yes -- You will do well to keep him in the same mind of making
his Will -- Since the young couple are together, and it is too late now, to part
them, we must do something to secure them an Estate


You say well -- And I will join with you in any thing; -- Provided always,
you carry it prudently, for fear of scandal: -- A blot, is no blot, till it be
hit


You must have a care that no one be in the Room, but our selves: -- Not so
much as his wife


By no means -- If they should, I will cause 'um to withdraw, upon pretense of
giving him some ghostly counsel, or the like: -- Farewell -- You Will find me
there


Not a word -- Make haste -- And be sure to break the Marriage to the good
woman, before the Alderman comes to know it -- Watch your time


I warrant you.


Madam, your father has sent for me, and I must leave you for the present; but
you shall be sure to hear from me suddenly: -- In the mean time, if you please
to repose your selves at my house, you shall be welcome: -- You cannot be safer,
nor nearer, if any occasion should be


With all our hearts.


THree hundred pounds a year, and conform: -- A fair opportunity, and if I slip
it, may I never have another: -- But hark you Mr. Scruple -- You must
subscribe: -- Well -- And I will do it: -- But what will the Brethren say? --
How will the sisters take it, when it shall be told 'um, Vir gregis, Ipse caper
decrraverat? -- Why -- 'Twas an Act of my hand, not an Act of my heart: -- But
stay -- What need this? -- Has not the direction of the intention, a faculty to
null promises? -- I take it, it has; -- What say the Casuists? -- If a man
promises, and had no intention to perform -- when he made it, he is not
obliged, unless there be an Oath, or Contract in the case; For, when a man
says simply, I will do thus, or thus, it shall be conceived, he meant, if his
mind did not alter; for otherwise, were to deprive him of his natural liberty:
-- But there is an Oath in the case (friend Scruple) There is an Oath -- How
will you do now? -- Well -- Suppose there be two: -- I take it, the case has
been determined long since -- I may take it proforma, by a previous
protestation nevertheless, that it shall not be prejudicial to me, in any thing
that I shall act to the contrary, hereafter; -- If not -- Our Brethren are
clear in the point -- Equivocation, in cases of necessity, may be lawful; --
It Is a Pia fraus: -- I Am sure, at worst, it is a probable opinion, and all
probable opinions are equally safe in themselves: -- But hold ye brother -- Are
not Oaths to be taken according to the meaning of the Exactor of the Oath? --
Perhaps they are; -- What then? Suppose I bring a probable opinion for the
meaning of the taker: -- The extremes are wide -- But I have found an Expedient
(and yet not mine, but our Brethrens still) The Swearer is not bound to the
meaning of the Prescriber of the Oath, or his own meaning -- How then? --
Sweetly: -- To the reality of the thing sworn: -- I think the hair is split: --
But who shall be Judge of that? -- Of that hereafter: -- In the mean time --
Here is 300 l. a year, and a goodly house upon 't: -- I will Conform, Reform,
Transform, Perform, Deform, Inform, any Form: -- Form -- Form --


Now bless the good man! --. What Is that he says? Form -- Form -- Marry I hope
you don't intend to Conform


Form is a good word -- A very good word -- Forma dat esse rei -- And without
it (sister of mine) you could be neither seen, felt, heard, nor understood


Now goodness defend him -- In the Highway to Egypt again.


Mistake me not -- I am neither for Highwayes, nor Highplaces: -- But --


But what? -- I hope you are not in earnest -- Will you forsake the Good old
Cause


Mr. Scruple Spew up the Holy Covenant?


It forsook me, and not I, it.


What will the vile Cavalier say?


How will the despisers of the Brethren bristle?


How will the old Enemy erect himself?


And the holy sisters be humbled?


Who shall carry on the great work?


Or perfect that, which you have begun?


Mr. Scruple transmogrifie?


Ah no --


You say right -- You are my workmanship -- I have been working you these
twenty years, and you are wrought: -- But alas (I speak not this to you) There
are a number of dissenting Brethren, and I have tried 'um this way, and that
way, and the other way, and (to say Truth) every way, but never the nearer; And
therefore, I Am even resolved, to try what the old way will do


Ah Mr. Scruple! -- Do you know what you say? -- The old way!


The old Whore!


Yes -- The old way, though no old Whore; -- Wherein notwithstanding, I do no
more than what ever was, is now, and ever will be: -- Mark what I say, and
observe it; -- our Brother Fox, that had so little wit, as to write his Book of
Martyrs, had yet enough, to keep himself, from being one of the number


Ah -- What will become of the stock?


And the little Lambs, how shall they play?


Who shall destroy the Chicken of the Wolf?


And break the Leviathan's Eggs, in the shell?


Come (sisters of mine) you live on the blind side of the World; -- I find the
Cause, and its interest, deserted by most people, unless it be some few, That
having found how sweet a thing it is to head a Faction, make use of us, as the
Monkey did of the Cats Paw, to scrape the Nuts out of the fire: -- I need say
no more, unless it be, That I have a fair opportunity of 300 l. a year offered
me


I -- do -- do -- And see who will repent it first: -- Never expect more Friday
Night Suppers


Nor the sweet society of Brethren, and sisters.


What fellowship is therein Stock Fish, and Oil?


Or, instead of Gellies, to be swill'd with Frummetrie?


To exchange your Venison, for Red Herrings, and Mustard?


And Virgin Pullets, for Ling, and Haberdine?


Who will be gainers now?


Or whose the loss, when this happens?


When the Benevolence shall dwindle to an Easter penny.


And purifying Dinners, into cracked Groats.


When you're at charge of a Gown, for Sundays, and Holidays.


And the Cassock, comes out of your own Pocket.


When the Boys cry after you, it grows too fast.


And the knot of your Sussingle sits in the wrong place.


And will you then leave us? Let not 300 l. a year be any thing in the case; we
will allow you four: -- Pray consider, Did we ever forsake you? What have you
lost by throwing your self on your friends? -- If the worst come to the worst,
rather than lose you, we will forsake our carnal Husbands, and carnal Children,
and march off, to New England together


Now cannot I forbear, but I must accept your 400 l. a year: -- Let a man
strive never so much against it, natural affection will return upon him --
Comfort your selves, That is to say, Be comforted, I will not forsake you --
Conclusum est contra, etc. I will not Conform -- Nay, verily I will not


Aa -- Mr. Scruple!


Hark! -- I hear the Alderman -- Run in -- Run in -- I Will follow you
instantly. l. a year, and not Conform: -- The women are good comfortable women,
and I ought not in Conscience to leave 'um: -- But hear me Brother -- What will
you do with your new Parsonage? -- Why -- I -- will -- get -- some or other
instituted, and inducted into 't, to save a Lapse, and take a Bond of 500 l. of
him, to resign at six Months; which, he will forfeit of course, as not doubting
but to be relieved against it, as Simoniacal: -- So -- There Is 500 l. got too
-- He Is gone every way: -- At common Law, it is his own Bond; In equity, he
might have resigned: -- But why so fast friend Scruple? Had not you as good
sell it outright to avoid dispute? -- I cannot tell -- But now I remember me,
The Casuists take a notable difference, that is to say, between money given
(provalore Beneficii) as the full price, and (tanquam motivum ad resignandum)
for your good will, or so; -- The first, they generally agree to be Simony; but
for the latter, they leave it as a controverted point, positivelie denied by
very few, but such as have no money to give.


Troth but ill; I Am half afraid of him.


Who Is that? Mr. Scruple?


Yes Sir -- How do you?


Uh -- Uh -- Very ill -- Is the Doctor coming?


He Will be here immediately -- Poor man! He was half distracted when I brought
him the News --


My dear Friend, how do you?


Oh -- Oh -- ill, ill: -- Uh -- Uh -- Uh -- Have you brought my old Will with
you? -- Let me see it. Uh -- Uh -- Uh --


Yes Sir, here it is.


Indeed Sir it is piouslie, and discreetlie done, to settle Affairs so, that
there may be no wrangling, in case you should do otherwise than well


I wonder my Boy comes not -- I have sent him for a Rosy-Crucian preparation,
has fetched a man again, after he has been dead a day, and half: -- I hope it
may do good; However, for fear of the worst, you do well to settle your Estate,
it may ease your head


Uh -- Uh -- Uh -- Here Doctor -- Put some wax to it; -- Set the Table nearer --
And give me my Seal --


Sir you are weak: -- Do you deliver this as your Act and Deed?


Yes -- I do -- Pray Gentlemen be Witnesses to it.


Oh -- Are you come at last -- Here Sir -- Here Is the most sovereign Cordial in
all the World -- I was seven years, in making one poor pint, and half often


I thank you Sir -- He drinks -- Uh -- Uh -- It warms me strangely -- Uh -- Uh
--


Pray forbear Coughing, -- you are weak -- How do you feel your self now?


I cannot tell -- But methinks it does me good.


I see by this sudden operation, 'twill do the work: -- You were best to walk
in, and rest your self in your Couch awhile, before the fire


I must run home a little, upon some urgent occasions, but will see you again
presently.


WHy Captain -- What? All a mort?


Faith I was contemplating upon the pence.


And thou shal't have 'um Boy -- See here my Bully! --


Dear Major give it me.


Thou shal't have any thing my Jo: -- Captain, Courage! We'll be merry to
Night, and have a Wedding, though it be but a Westminster one


What you will.


Well said Major: -- Ah for a Fiddle now: -- Odds nigs!


I hate those Puritan Oaths -- If thou must swear, swear like a man of Office.


The old Boy still -- Now could I Caper through the Moon: -- Hey Toss -- Hang
one Fiddle, we'll have a whole Kennel: -- Come you Jade -- Dance


Alas Major -- How pitifully my Husband is cut! -- He Will be so sick tomorrow
morning


Yes faith; -- He has got a Rattle as big as a Drum.


Major! -- A word -- Do you think my Wife's a Whore?


Such another word -- And -- By all the bones of my back --


Nay good Major -- I was once a little jealous, till she told you of the
Aldernian -- But now, I dare trust her to Lecture by her self


What Is that you say of me?


Stand -- Who comes there? -- Knock 'um down? -- What are you? -- I am the
Constable


The Fellow's mad.


No Sir, he is only a little overtaken as they say.


Stand off -- Down with 'um -- Stand -- Treason -- I command you to apprehend
one another


Maine a good time, has this Fellows head been broke, to keep the peace whole
-- 'Prithee take him away


Landlord -- They Are friends.


Which -- Where -- Here I could have 'um, and there I could have 'um: --
Runter! -- I profess I knew you not


Then ha'done now -- Come Gentlemen, What say you? The business must be
discovered first or last, and as good now (and perhaps better) than another
time


I like it well -- But think it were not amiss to lessen the Company -- We will
not appear all at once


However let 'um be within call.


Pray Gentlemen keep together -- We shall have occasion to use you presently.


You see my Arm's in a Scarf -- Much cannot be expected from me: -- But for a
dead lift, we'll make a shift to change hands: -- Gi' the word of command
there, faces about, etc


And hear me Major -- Lend me your Chain: -- And let it be you care to provide
some abominable Music: -- We'll bring him to our Bow, or run him to death with
Fiddlers: --


I warrant you -- Here --


How! Married? O my Child -- My Child!


You might have believed me sooner -- How often have I told you, she was in her
Teenes? -- And you know Teene, quasi Teeming: -- I may be a little free with
you -- Young Girls are like Nuts, you must gather them when they begin to be
brown at bottom, or they will fall of themselves


But truly, I hope it is not so plain as you make it.


How think you?


O my Child, my Child -- Thy father is pretty hoddie again, but this will
break his heart quite -- O my Child -- Has he not hurt thee?


No great sign of death Mother.


What Is all this clutter? -- Here Is a noise for a sick man, with all my heart!
--


Nothing but Matrimony Sir, and Conjugal Love.


And were you Pimp to it? -- I hope you have made sure of her portion -- I can
assure you her Grandfather left her not so much as a gray Groat


I have enough in her.


Much good may't do you.


Good Sir forgive me.


Out of my doors -- The wench is pretty handsome, and will be able to get her
own living, if the Parish will but keep the Children


I must not hear this language -- Know you this -- A good honest settlement
upon my self.


Ha! Settlement! And in consideration of Marriage! -- I was not drunk sure! --
When was this done


Only a little Crop sick -- Very lately.


Indeed Sir, you desired this Gentleman, and my self, to be Witnesses to it --
I know my hand again


I saw you sign, seal, and deliver it.


I published only my Will.


I know not what your meaning was; but you delivered it as your Act, and Deed.


Timothy -- Fetch me the Constable.


Sir, he will save you that trouble; I met him just coming to you, about a
suspicious person, whom he apprehended with This Chain in his pocket.


Cheated -- Cheated -- As I Am an Alderman, purelie Cheated.


How can that be -- you have the Reputation, of as shrewd a man, as any upon
the Bench


Ah -- Rogues all -- Rogues all --


What say you Sir? Here Is the Constable now: -- Come, come, be wise: -- Your
Daughter has married a Gentleman: -- Is not this better, than a Smithfield
bargain? -- Give me so much money, and my Horse shall leap your Mare


Don't worrie me with words -- I Will consider often.


Good Sir -- Marriages are made in Heaven.


Then I Will be sworn, I had never a friend there.


Truly nor I neither -- For indeed, methinks they are very long in coming
down.


Now verily Sir, but this is a just judgment upon you, for hoarding up your
moneys, and suffering the Good Old Cause to starve


Seriech-owle: -- But where is my Doctor?


Why troth Sir (you cannot blame him) he is somewhat loath to appear, till he
see how things are like to go: -- Come, pray Sir --


Well Sir -- I see by this Chain, the Major and you, understand one another --
Let Us have no more words -- All parties shall be satisfied -- Give me't


There -- And may you long live to wear't: -- You may come down -- All Is well
--


Come Son and Daughter, the business is done, and I forgive you both -- And if
that settlement be not large enough, I Will make you a new one upon demand -- You
shall have your own Estate back, in present, and as you love your Wife, the
rest after our deaths: -- And so, you have my blessing


Bea.


Come, let us be merry -- And as late as it is send for the Music -- We must
have a Dance, at least


See what it is to forecast a man's business right; -- They are gone for, and
will be here instantly


But we forget the main thing, the Posset: -- Quickly Cis, and get one ready.


How Is this? Music! Dancing! Posset! -- Are they lawful good Mr. Scruple?


Are they not, Rags of the Whore?


Thereafter as they may be used -- I will consider it a little, and give you my
opinion --


O my Doctor -- You're a fine Gentleman -- Good faith you are.


Who I? -- I care not if all my faults were writ in my forehead: --


It must be in short hand then, or there will want room.


Here Is Tyro, too -- Your even come time enough to dance at your Mistresses
Wedding


How! My Mistresses Wedding?


Even so -- Alas that I had but known of this before!


Women will have their wills -- Let her go -- I have another guess thing, in
chase for you


And shall I have her?


Thou shall -- And hark you --


Hum -- I am full; and shall discourse 'um graduallie: -- And first, of the
first -- Music; -- Yes certainly, it is lawful -- But, what Music? That Is
the question: -- We'll examine it a little -- Cimbals, they are Jewish, -- The
Harp, malignant, and Irish; -- Organs, Antichristian; -- The Fluit, a mere
Horn-pipe; -- The Fiddle, Out upon it! Most abominable, it ushers in Revels, and
May-poles: -- What then? -- Why truly I agree with the Assembly -- Bag-pipes;
-- A harmless, innocent Music, and most agreeable, to the Discipline, and
practice, of our Brethren of the Kirk: -- Besides, it has (as the Learned
observe) a specific quality, to mollify, and soften the most brutal natures
-- Witness, the Bears -- Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros. -- But secondly,
for Dancing -- Why truly, that may be lawful too -- But here too, the point
will be the same; -- What Dancing? -- Country Dances; they are Pagan; --
French Dances; Fie, Fie, Antic; -- Our ordinary dancing; villainous; it is
mixed, and promiscuous, a very Nicolait^^ism: -- The Benchers measures; I must
confess they come somewhat near, were they not superstitious: -- What then? --
Why -- The men may dance in one Room, and the women in the other: -- Lastly, for
the Posset -- And truly here, I Am in a great Wood -- But not to dwell upon the
Letter, whither Posset, or P-osset, I shall take it as it lies before me --
Posset -- And truly that may be lawful too: -- Lemon Posset, is cooling --
Carduus Posset, Benedictus -- And Sack-Posset, comfortable -- But Wedding --
Sack -- Posset -- There Is the point; -- Truly, I half doubt it, and that for
fifteen Reasons -- Hum --


A plague of these Fiddlers -- We shall be murdered ere they come.


I say for fifteen Reasons: -- First, from the name of the thing; Posset, from
Posse, To be able; And from that fond supposition, first brought into
VVeddings, An invention, merely carnal: -- But secondly, for that it ministers
abundance of unsavory discourse: -- Thirdly, for that the Grace before it, is
none at all, and the Grace after it, lewd: -- Fourthly, That it is eaten (by
the parties chiefly concerned) only in spite: -- Fithly, -- Hum -- Haw -- I
say fifthly --


Servavit Apollo! -- Strike up, strike up -- One noise best drowns another.


A wholesome observation lost.


'Twill keep cold for another time.


Come Gentlemen -- One Dance, and then for the Posset,


Well moved -- Well moved -- The Bride begins to be sleepy.


Lead on before there -- I Will bring up the Rear -- Come Landlord -- Bear up for
the Bar of Chester; And since we have had so good fortune to day, we'll
henceforth boil our Beef in Sack, and make the Beggars drunk with the
Porridge.


THese, and such other literal mistakes, as you may chance to meet with, be
pleased to correct. -- Page 2. line 10. for, dead a Horse -- read -- a dead

I Had almost forgot -- Let Us see -- What weather?
Nor fair; -- Nor foul; -- Indifferent; -- Both together,
Clear, if no Clouds, nor misling; -- If there should,
It shall proceed from former Causes: -- Good:
So much for Doctrine -- To Apply it now;
Yo've had A Play, But, whither good, or No,
It Is past my Globe, -- yet guess, the weather will
Prove fair enough, unless you make it ill.
It Is you must make the Play, or stand, or fall;
Therefore, By me, To you, and you, and All,
The Author bows -- And perhaps reason for 't;
Some Men the Judge, others, the Jury Court;
The one, more Just, if unconcerned; The other,
More Pitiful; If he claps both together,
He means no hurt; For in a common Hall,
Noise carries it -- He fain would please you All:
Yo've had for Pit, for Box, for Gallery too;
Keep your own Posts, and he is well enou':
But -- If you must lash out, And think you cannot
Be wits your selves, unless you pique, and rant;
At your own Peril be it, And further know,
Who gives a Character, in one, gives two:
He hopes the best -- Nor will we, be perplexed;
Laugh hearty now, and he shall fix you next.
