I Would not for half Sauoy, but have bound
France to some favor, by my personal presence
More than your self, (my Lord Ambassador)
Could have obtaind; for all Ambassadors
(You know) have chiefly these instructions;
To note the State and chief sway of the Court,
To which they are employde; to penetrate
The heart, and marrow of the Kings designs,
And to observe the countenances and spirits,
Of such as are impatient of rest;
And wring beneath, some private discontent:
But, past all these, there are a number more
Of these State Critiscismes: That our personal view
May profitably make, which cannot fall
Within the powers of our instruction,
To make you comprehend; I will do more
With my mere shadow, than you with your persons.
All you can say against my coming here,
Is that, which I confess, may for the time,
Breed strange affections in my brother Spain;
But when I shall have time to make my Cannans,
The long-tong'd Heralds of my hidden drifts,
Our reconcilement will be made with triumphs.

If not, your Highness has small cause to care,
Having such worthy reason to complain
Of Spaines cold friendship, and his lingering succors,
Who only entertaines your griefs with hope,
To make your medcine desperate.

My Lord knows
The Spanish gloss too well; his form* stuffe'lasting,
And the most dangerous conditions,
He lays on them with whom he is in league.
Th'iniustice in the most unequal dowre,
Given with the Infanta whom my Lord espousde,
Compared with that her elder sister had,
May tell him how much Spaines love weighs to him;
When of so many Globes and Scepters held
By the great King, he only would bestow
A portion but of six score thousand Crowns
In yearly pension, with his highness wife,
When the Infanta wedded by the Archduke
Had the Franch County, and low Provinces.

We should not set these passages of Spleen
Twixt Spain and Sauoy; to the weaker part,
More good by suff^ance grows, than deeds of heart,
The nearer Princes are, the further off
In rites of friendship; my advice had never
Consented to this voyage of my Lord,
In which he does endaunger Spaines whole loss,
For hope of some poor fragment here in France.

My hope in France you know not, though my counsel,
And for my loss of Spain, it is agreede,
That I should slight it, oft-times Princes rules
Are like the Chymicall Philosophers;
Leave me then to mine own proiection,
In this our thriftie Alchymie of state,
Yet help me thus far, you that have been here
Our Lord Ambassador; and, in short inform me,
What Spirits here are fit for our designs.

The new-created Duke Byron is fit,
Were there no other reason for your presence,
To make it worthy; for he is a man
Of matchless valor, and was ever happy
In all encounters, which were still made good,
With an vnwearyed sense of any toil,
Having continewd fourteen days together
Upon his horse; his blood is not voluptuous,
Nor much inclinde to women; his desires
Are higher than his sta^e* and his deserts
Not much short of the most he can desire,
If they be weigh^d with what France feels by them:
He is past measure glorious: And that humor
Is fit to feed his Spirits, whom it possesses
With faith in any error; chiefly where
Men blow it up, with praise of his perfections,
The taste whereof in him so soothes his palate,
And takes up all his appetite, that often times
He will refuse his meat, and company
To feast alone with their most strong conceit;
Ambition also, cheek by cheek does march
With that excess of glory, both su^taind
With an unlimited fancy, That the King,
Nor Fr^unce it self, without him can subsist.

He is the man (my Lord) I come to win;
And that supreme intention of my presence
Saw never light till now, which yet I fear,
The politic king, suspecting, is the cause
That he has sent him so far from my reach,
And made him chief in the Commission,
Of his embassage to my brother Archduke,
With whom he is now; and (as I am told)
So entertaind and fitted in his humor,
That ere I part, I hope he will return
Prepared, and made the more fit for the physic
That I intend to minister.

My Lord,
There is another discontented Spirit
Now here in Court, that for his brain, and aptnes
To any course that may recover him
In his declined and litigious state,
Will serve Byro^, as he were made for him,
In giving vent to his ambitious vain,
And that is, De Laffin.

You tell me true,
And him I think you have prepared for me.

I have my Lord, and doubt not he will p^ooue,
Of the yet taintlesse fortress of Byron,
A quick Expugner, and a strong Abider.

Perhaps the battry will be brought before him,
In this embassage, for I am assured
They set high price of him, and are informde
Of all the passages, and means for mines
That may be thought on, to his taking in:
The King comes, and Laffin: the Kings aspect
Folded in clouds.

I will not have my train,
Made a retreite for Bankroutes, nor my Court,
A hyue for Droanes: proud Beggars, and true Thieues,
That with a forced truth they swear to me,
Rob my poor subjects, shall give up their Arts,
And henceforth learn to live by their deserts;
Though I am grown, by right of Birth and Arms
Into a greater kingdom, I will spread
With no more shade, then may admit that kingdom
Her proper, natural, and woonted fruits,
Navarre shall be Navarre, and France still France:
If one may be the better for the other
By mutual rites, so, neither shall be worse.
Thou art in law, in quarrels, and in debt,
Which thou would quit with countnaunce; Borrowing
With thee is purchase, and thou seekst by me
(In my supportance) now our old wars cease
To wage worse battles, with the arms of Peace.

Peace must not make men Cowherds, nor keep calm
Her pursie regiment with men's smootherd breaths;
I must confess my fortunes are declinde,
But neither my deseruings, nor my mind:
I seek but to sustain the right I found,
When I was rich, in keeping what is left,
And making good my honor as at best,
Though it be hard; man's right to every thing
Wanes with his wealth, wealth is his surest King;
Yet Justice should be still indifferent.
The overplus of Kings, in all their might,
Is but to piece out the defects of right:
And this I sue for, nor shall frowns and taunts
(The common Scarre-crowes of all poor men's suites)
Nor mis-construction that does color still
Licentiate Justice, punishing good for ill,
Keep my free throat from knocking at the Sky,
If thunder chid me for my equity.

Thy equity, is to be ever banished
From Court, and all society of noblesse,
Amongst whom thou throwst balls of all dissension;
Thou art at peace with nothing but with war,
Have no heart but to hurt, and ea^st thy heart,
If it but think of doing any good:
Thou witchest with thy smiles, suckst blood with praises,
Mock'st al humanity; society poisonst;
Coosinst with virtue; with religion
Betrayst, and massacrest; so vile thy self,
That thou suspectst perfection in others:
A man must think of all the villainies
He knows in all men, to descipher thee,
That art the center to impiety:
Away, and tempt me not.

But you tempt me,
To what, thou Sun be judge, and make him see.

Now by my dearest Marquisate of Salusses,
Your Majesty has with the greatest life
Described a wicked man; or rather thrust
Your arm down through him to his very feet,
And plucked his inside out, that ever yet,
Mine ears did witness; or turned ears to Eyes;
And those strange Characters, writ in his face,
which' at first sight, were hard for me to read,
The Doctrine of your speech, has made so plain,
That I run through them like my natural language:
Nor do I like that man's Aspect, me thinks,
Of all looks where the Beams of Stars have carved
Their powrefull influences; And (O rare)
What an heroicke, more than royal Spirit
Bewraide you in your first speech, that defies
Protection of vile droanes, that eat the honny
Swette from laborious virtue, and denies
To give those of Navarre, though bred with you,
The benefits and dignities of France.
When little Rivers by their greedy currants,
(Far far extended from their mother springs)
Drink up the foreign brooks still as they run,
And force their greatness, when they come to Sea,
And iustle with the Ocean for a room,
O how he roares, and takes them in his mouth,
Digesting them so to his proper streams,
That they are no more seen, he nothing raisde
Above his usual bounds, yet they devoured,
That of themselves were pleasant, goodly floods.

I would do best for both, yet shall not be secure,
Till in some absolute heirs my Crown be settled,
There is so little now betwixt Aspirers
And their great object in my only self,
That all the strength they gather under me,
Tempts combat with mine own: I therefore make
Means for some issue by my marriage,
Which with the great Dukes niece is now concluded,
And she is coming; I have trust in heaven
I am not yet so old, but I may spring,
And then I hope all traitrous hopes will fade.

Else may their whole estates fly, rooted up
To Ignominy and Oblivion:
And (being your neighbor servant, and poor kinsman)
I wish your mighty Race might multiply,
Even to the Period of all Emperie.

Thanks to my princely coozen, this your love
And honor ^hewne me in your personal presence,
I wish to welcome to your full content:
The peace I now make with your brother Archduke,
By Duke Byron our Lord Ambassador,
I wish may happily extend to you,
And that at his return we may conclude it.

It shall be to my heart the happiest day
Of all my life, and that life all employed,
To celebrate the honor of that day.

The wondrous honor done our Duke Byron
In his Embassage here, in th'Archdukes Court,
I fear will taint his loyalty to our King.
I will observe how they observe his humor,
And glorify his valor; and how he
Accepts and stands attractiue to their ends,
That so I may not seem an idle spot
In train of this embassage but return
Able to give our King some note of all,
Worth my attendance; And see, here is the man,
Who (though a French man, and in Orleance borne
Serving the Archduke) I do most suspect,
Is set to be the tempter of our Duke;
I Will go where I may see, all though not hear.

Spread here this history of Cateline,
That Earth may seem to bring forth Roman Spirits;
Even to his Geniall feet; and her da^ke breast
Be made the clear Glass of his shining Graces,
We Will make his feet so tender, they shall gall
In all paths but to Empire; and therein
I Will make the sweet Steps of his State begin.

What place is this? what air? what rhegion?
In which a man may hear the harmony
Of all things moving? Hymen marries here,
Their ends and uses and makes me his Temple.
Has any man been blessed, and yet lived?
The blood turns in my veins, I stand on change,
And shall dissolve in changing; it is so full
Of pleasure not to be containde in flesh:
To fear a violent Good, abuses Goodness,
It Is Immortallitie to die aspiring,
As if a man were taken quick to heaven;
What will not hold Perfection, let it burst;
What force has any Cannan, not being chargde,
Or being not dischargde? To have stuff and form,
And to lie idle, fearful, and vnus'd,
Nor form, nor stuff shows; happy Semel^
That died comprest with Glory: Happiness
Denies comparison, of less, or more,
And not at most, is nothing: like the shaft
Shot at the Sun, by angry Hercules,
And into shiuers by the thunder broken
Will I be if I burst: And in my heart
This shall be written: yet it was high and right.
Here too? they follow all my steps wi^h Music,
As if my feet were numerous, and trod sounds
Out of the Center, with Apolloes virtue,
That out of every thing his ech-part touched,
Struck musical accents: wheresoever I go,
They hide the earth from me with couerings rich,
To make me think that I am here in heaven.

Th^s way, your Highness.

Come they?

I my Lord.

My Lord d' Aumall, I am exceeding sorry,
That your own obstinacy to hold out,
Your mortal enmity against the King,
When Duke du Maine, and all the faction yielded,
Should force his wrath to use the rites of treason,
Upon the members of your senseless Statue,
Your Name and House, when he had lost your person,
Your love and duty.

That which men enforce
By their own wilfulness; they must endure
With willing patience, and without complaint.

I use not much impatience nor complaint.
Though it offends me much, to have my name
So blotted with addition of a Traitor.
And my whole memory, (with such despite,
Marked and begun to be so rooted out.)

It was despite that held you out so long,
Whose penance in the King was needful justice.

Come let us seek our Duke, and take our leaves
Of th'Archdukes grace.

Here may we safely breathe?

No doubt (my Lord) no stranger knows this way*
One^y the Archduke, and your friend Count Mansfield,
Perhaps may make their general scapes to you,
To utter some part of their private loves,
E^e your departure.

Then, I well perceive
To what th'intention of his highness tends;
For whose, and others here, most worthy Lords,
I will become (with all my worth) their servant,
In any office, but disloyalty;
Bu^ that has ever showd so foul a monster
To all my Ancestors, and my former life,
That now to entertain it; I must wholly
Give up my habit, in his contrary,
And strive to grow out of privation.

My Lord, to wear your loyal habit still,
When it is out of fashion; and has done
Service enough; were rusticke misery:
The habit of a servile loyalty,
Is reck^nd now amongst priuations,
With blindness, dumbness, deafness, scilence, death,
All which are neither natures by themselves
Nor substances, but mere decays of form,
And absolute decessions of nature,
And so, it is nothing, what shall you then loose?
Your highness has a habit in perfection,
And in desert of highest dignities,
Which carue your self, and be your own rewarder*
No true power does admit privation,
Adverse to him; or suffers any fellow
Ioynde in his subject; you, superiors;
It is the nature of things absolute.
One to destroy another; be your Highness,
Like those steep hills that will admit no clouds,
No deawe^, nor lest fumes bound about their brows;
Because their tops pierce into purest air,
Expert of humor; or like air it self
That quickly changes; and receives the sun
Soon as he rises; every where dispersing
His royal splendour; guirds it in his beams,
And makes it self the body of the light;
Hot, shining, swift, light, and aspiring things,
Are of immortal, and celestial nature;
Cold, dark, dull, heavy of infernal fortunes,
And never aim at any happiness:
Your excellency knows; that simple loyalty,
Faith, love, sincerity, are but words, no things;
Merely deuisde for form; and as the Legate,
Sent from his Holiness, to frame a peace
Twixt Spain and Sauoy; labored ^eruently,
(For common ends, not for the Dukes particular)
To have him sign it; he again endeavors
(Not for the Legates pains, but his own pleasure)
To gratify him; and being at last encountered;
Where the flood Tesyn enters into Po,
They made a kind contention, which of them
Should enter the others boat; one thrust the other:
One leg was over, and another in:
And with a fiery courtesy, at last
Sauoy leapes out, into the Legates arms,
And here ends all his love, and the others labor;
So shall these terms, and impositions
Expressed before, hold nothing in themselves
Really good; but florishes of form:
And further then they make to private ends
None wise, or free, their propper use intends.

O it is a dangerous, and a dreadful thing
To steal prey from a Lion; or to hide
A head distrustful, in his opened jaws;
To trust our blood in others veins; and hang
Twixt heaven and earth, in vapors of their breaths:
To leave a sure pace on continuate earth,
And force a gate in iumps, from tower to tower,
As they do that aspire, from height to height;
The bounds of loyalty are made of glass,
Soon broke, but can in no date be repaird;
And as the Duke D'Aumall, (now here in Court)
Flying his country; had his Statue tome
Peece-meale with horses; all his goods confiscate,
His Arms of honor, kicked about the streets,
His goodly house at Annet rac'd to the earth.
And (for a strange reproach of his foul treason)
His trees about it, cut off by their wastes;
So, when men fly the natural clime of truth,
And turn themselves loose, out of all the bounds
Of Justice, and the straightway to their ends;
Forsaking all the sure force in themselves
To seek, without them, that which is not theirs,
The forms of all their comforts are distracted;
The riches of their freedoms forfaited;
Their human noblesse shamd; the Mansions
Of their cold spirits, eaten down with Cares;
And all their ornaments, of wit, and valor,
Learning, and judgment, cut from all their fruits.

O, here were now the richest prize in Europe,
Were he but taken in affection,
Would we might grow together, and be twins
Of eithers fortune; or that, still embraced
I were, but Ring to such a precious stone:

Your highness honors, and high bounty shown me,
Have won from me, my voluntary power;
And I must now move by your eminent will;
To what particular objects; if I know
By this man's intercession, he shall bring:
My uttermost answer, and perform betwixt us,
Reciprocal and full intelligence.

Even for your own deserved royal good,
It Is joyfully accepted, use the loves
And worthy admirations of your friends,
That beget vows of all things you can wish,
And be what I wish: danger says, no more.

Your highness makes the light of this Court stoop,
With your so near departure, I was forced
To tender to your excellence, in brief,
This private wish in taking of my leave;
That in some army Royal, old Cont Mansfield,
Might be commanded by your matchles valor,
To the supreamest point of v^ctorie:
Who vows for that renown all prayer, and service:
No more least I may wrong you.

Thank your Lordship.

All majesty be added to your highness,
Of which, I would not wish your breast to bear
More modest apprehension: then may tread,
The high gate of your spirit; and be known
To be a fit Bound for your Boundless valor;

So Oreng wishes, and to the deserts
Of your great actions, their most royal Crown.

Away my Lord, the Lords enquire for you.

Would we might win his valor to our part.

It Is well prepared in his entreaty here;
With all states highest observations:
And to their form, and words are added gifts,
He was presented with two goodly horses,
One of which two, was the brave Beast Pastrana:
With plate of gold, and a much prized jewel;
Girdle and hangers, set with welthy stones:
All which were vallewed, at ten thousand crowns;
The other Lords had suites of tapistry,
And chains of gold, and every gentleman
A pair of Spanish Gloves, and Rapire blades:
And here ends their entreaty; which I hope
Is the beginning of more good to us,
Then twenty thousand times their gifts to them.

My Lord, I grieve that all the setting forth,
Of our best welcome, made you more retired:
Your chamber has been more loved then our honors;
And therefore we are glad your time of parting
Is come to set you in the air you love:
Commend my service to his Majesty,
And tell him that this day of peace with him
I Will hold, as holy. All your pains my Lords
I shall be always glad to gratefie
With any love and honor, your own hearts
Shall do me grace to wish expressed to you.

Here has been strange demeaneure, which shall fly,
To the great author of this Ambassy.

Admit no entry, I will speak with none,
Good signior de Laffin, your worth shall find,
That I will make a jewel for my cabinet,
Of that the King (in surfeit of his store)
Has cast out, as the sweepings of his hall;
I told him, having threatened you away,
That I did wonder, this small time of peace,
Could make him cast his armor so securely
In such as you, and as twere set the head
Of one so great in counsels, on his foot,
And pitch him from him with such guardlike strength.

He may perhaps find he has pitched away,
The Axeltree that kept him on his wheels.

I told him so, I swear, in other terms
And not with too much note of our close loves
Least so he might have smokt our practices.

To choose his time, and spit his poison on me,
Through the ears, and eyes of strangers.

So I told him
And more then that, which now I will not tell you:
It rests now then, Noble, and worthy friend,
That to our friendship, we draw Duke Byron,
To whose attraction there is no such chain,
As you can fordge, and shake out of your brain.

I have deuisde the fashion and the weight;
To valures hard to draw, we use retreates;
And, to pull shaftes home, (with a good bow-arme)
We thrust hard from us: since he came from Flanders
He heard how I was threatened with the King,
And has been much inquisitiue to know
The truth of all, and seeks to speak with me;
The means he used, I answered doubtfully;
And with an intimation that I shund him,
Which will (I know) put more spur to his charge;
And if his haughty stomach be preparde*
With will to any act: for the aspiring
Of his ambitious aims, I make no doubt
But I shall work him to your highness wish.

But undertake it, and I rest assured:
You are reported to have skill in Magic,
And the events of things, at which they reach
That are in nature apt to ouerreach:
Whom the whole circkle of the present time,
In present pleasures, fortunes, knowledges,
Can not contain: those men (as broken loose
From human limmits) in all violent ends
Would feign aspire the faculties of fiends,
And in such air breathe his unbounded spirits,
Which therefore well will fit such coniurations,
Attempt him then by flying; close with him,
And bring him home to us, and take my dukedom.

My best in that, and all things, vows your service.

Thanks to my dear friend; and the French Ulysses.

Here is the man; my honored friend, Laffin?
Alone, and heavy countinanc't? on what terms
Stood the insultation of the King upon you?

Why do you ask?

Since I would know the truth.

And when you know it; what?

I Will judge betwixt you,
And (as I may) make even the excess of either.

Ah las my Lord, not all your loyalty,
Which is in you, more then hereditary,
Nor all your valor (which is more then humane)
Can do the service you may hope on me
In sounding my displeasde integrity;
Stand for the King, as much in policy
As you have stird for him in deeds of arms,
And make your self his glory, and your countries
Till you be sucked as dry, and wrought as leave,
As my stead carcass: you shall never close
With me, as you imagine.

You much wrong me,
To think me an intelligencing Lord.

I know not now your so affected zeal,
To be reputed a true hearted subject,
May stretch or turn you; I am desperate;
If I offend you, I am in your power:
I care not how I tempt your conquering fury,
I am predestined to too base an end,
To have the honor of your wrath destroy me;
And be a worthy object for your sword:
I lay my hand, and head too at your feet,
As I have ever, here I hold it still,
End me directly, do not go about.

How strange is this? the shame of his disgrace
Has made him lunatique.

Since the King has wronged me
He thinks I Will hurt my self; no, no, my Lord:
I know that all the Kings in Christendom,
(If they should join in my revenge) would prove
Weak foes to him: still having you to friend:
If you were gone (I care not if you tell him)
I might be tempted then to right my self.

He has a will to me, and dares not show it,
His state decai'd, and he disgraced; distracts him.

Change not my words my Lord, I only said
I might be tempted then to right my self:
Temptation to treason, is no treason;
And that word (tempted) was conditional too,
If you were gone, I pray inform the truth.

Stay injured man, and know I am your friend,
Far from these base, and mercenarie reaches,
I am I swear to you.

You may be so;
And yet you will give me leave to be Laffin,
A poor and expuate humor of the Court:
But what good blood came out with me; what veins
And sinews of the Triumphs, now it makes;
I list not vante; yet will I now confess,
And dare assume it; I have power to add
To all his greatness; and make yet more fixed
His bold security; Tell him this my Lord;
And this (if all the spirits of earth and air,
Be able to enforce) I can make good:
If knowledge of the sure events of things,
Even from the rise of subjects into Kings:
And falls of Kings to subjects hold a power
Of strength to work it; I can make it good;
And tell him this to; if in midest of winter
To make black Groves grow green; to still the thunder;
And cast out able flashes from mine eyes,
To beat the lightning back into the skies,
Prove power to do it, I can make it good;
And tell him this too; if to lift the Sea
Up to the Stars, when all the Wind are still;
And keep it calm, when they are most enraged:
To make earths driest pallms, sweat humorous springs
To make fixed rocks walk; and loose shadows stand,
To make the dead speak. midnight see the Sun,
Mid-daie turn midnight; to dissolve all laws
Of nature, and of order, argue power
Able to work all, I can make all good,
And all this tell the King.

It Is more then strange,
To see you stand thus at the rapiers point
With one so kind and sure a friend as I.

Who cannot friend himself, is foe to any,
And to be feared of all, and that is it,
Makes me so skornd, but make me what you can;
Never so wicked, and so full of feends,
I never yet, was traitor to my friends:
The laws of friendship I have ever held,
As my religion; and for other laws;
He is a fool that keeps them with more care,
Then they keep him, safe, rich, and populare:
For riches, and for populare respects
Take them amongst ye Minions, but for safety,
You shall not find the least flaw in mine arms,
To pierce or taint me; what will great men be,
To please the King, and bear authority.

How fic a tort were this to hansell fortune?
And I will win it though I loose my self,
Though he prove harder then Egiptian Marble,
I Will make him malliable, as the Ophyr gold;
I am put off from this dull shore of East,
Into industrious, and high-going Seas;
Where, like Pelides in Scamanders flood,
Up to the ears in surges, I will fight,
And pluck French Ilion underneath the waves;
If to be highest still, be to be best,
All works to that end are the worthiest:
Truth is a golden Ball, cast in our way,
To make us stripped by falsehood: And as Spain
When the hot scuffles of Barbarian arms,
Smotherd the life of Don Sebastian,
To guild the leaden rumor of his death
Gave for a slaughterd body (held for his)
A hundred thousand crowns; causd all the state
Of superstitious Portugal to mourn
And celebrate his solemn funerals;
The Moors to conquest, thankful feasts prefer,
And all made with the carcass of a Switzer:
So in the Giant like, and politic wars
Of barbarous greatness, raging still in peace,
Shows to aspire just objects; are laid on
With cost, with labor, and with form enough,
Which only makes our best acts brook the light,
And their ends had, we think we have their right,
So wurst works are made good, with good success,
And so for Kings, pay subjects carcases.

Was he so courted?

As a City Dame,
Brought by her jealous husband, to the Court,
Some elder Courtiers entertaining him,
While others snatch, a favor from his wife:
One starts from this door; from that nooke another,
With gifts, and iunkets, and with printed phrase,
Steal her employment, shifting place by place
Still as her husband comes: so Duke Byron
Was wood, and worshipped in the Archdukes Court,
And as th'assistants that your Majesty,
Ioinde in Commission with him, or my self*
Or any other doubted eye appeared,
He ever vanished: and as such a dame,
As we compared with him before, being wun
To break faith to her husband, loose her fame,
Stain both their progenies, and coming fresh
From underneath the burden of her shame,
Visits her husband with as chaste a browe,
As temperate, and confirmed behavior,
As she came quitted from confession.
So from his scapes, would he present a presence,
The practice of his state adultery,
And guilt that should a graceful bosom strieke,
Drownde in the set lake, of a hopeless cheek.

It may be he dissembled, or suppose,
He be a little tainted: men whom virtue
Forms with the stuff of fortune great, and gracious,
Must needs partake with fortune in her humor
Of instabilitie: and are like to shafts
Grown crookt with standing, which to rectify,
Must twice as much be bowd another way,
He that has borne wounds for his worthy parts,
Must for his wurst be borne with: we must fit
Our government to men, as men to it:
In old time, they that hunted sauadge beasts,
Are said to clothe themselves in savage skins,
They that were Fowlers when they went on fowling,
Wore garments made with wings resembling Fowls:
To Bulls, we must not show our selves in red,
Nor to the warlick Elephant in white,
In all things governed, their infirmities
Must not be stird, nor wrought on; Duke Byron
Flows with adust, and melancholy choler,
And melancholy spirits are venomous:
Not to be touched, but as they may be cur'de:
I therefore mean to make him change the air,
And send him further from those Spanish vapors,
That still bear fighting sulphur in their breasts,
To breath a while in temperate English air,
Where lips are spyc^d with free and loyal counsels,
Where policies are not rumous, but saving;
Wisdom is simple, valor righteous*
Human, and hating facts of brutish forces
And whose grave natures, scorn the scoffs of France,
The empty complements of Italy,
The any-way encroching pride of Spain,
And love men modest, hearty, just and plain.

I Will sound him for Byron; and what I find,
In the Kings depth; i will draw up, and inform,
In excitations to the Dukes revolt,
When next I meet with him.

It must be done
With praising of the Duke; from whom the king
Will take to give himself; which told the Duke,
Will take his heart up into all ambition.

I know it (politic friend:) and it is my purpose,
Your Majesty has mist a royal sight,
The Duke Byron* on his brave beast Pastrana,
Who sits him like a full-saild Argosea,
Danced with a lofty billow, and as s^ug
Plyes to his bearer, both their motions mixed;
And being considerd in their site together,
They do the best present the state of man,
In his first royalty ruling; and of beasts
In their first loyalty serving; one commanding,
And no way being moved; the other serving,
And no way being compeld; of all the sights
That ever my eyes witnest; and they make
A doctrinall and witty Hierogliphick,
O^ a blessed kingdom: to express and teach,
Kings to command as they could serve, and subjects
To serve as if they had power to command.

You are a good old horseman I perceive,
And still out all the use of that good part:
Your wit is of the true Pierean spring,
That can make any thing, of any thing.

So brave a subject as the Duke, no king
Seated on earth, can vante of but your Highness,
So valiant, loyal, and so great in service.

No question he sets valor in his height,
And has done service to an equal pitche,
Fortune attending him with fit events,
To all his ventrous and well-laid attempts.

Fortune? to him was Juno, to Alcides,
For when, or where did she but open way,
To any act of his? what stone took he
With her help or without his own lost blood?
What sort wan he by her? or was not forced?
What victory but gainstods? on what Commander
Sleepy or negligent, did he ever change?
What Summer ever made she fai^e to him?
What winter, not of one continued storm?
Fortune is so far from his Creditresse,
That she owes him much; for in him, her looks
Are lovely, modest, and magnanimous,
Constant, victorious; and in his Achieuments,
Her cheeks are drawn out with a virtuous redness,
Out of his eager spirit to victory,
And chaste contention to convince with honor;
And (I have heard) his spirits have flowd so high,
In all his conflicts against any odds,
That (in his charge) his lips have bled with teruor:
How served he at your famous siege of Dreux?
Where the enemy (assured of victory)
Drew out a body of four thousand horse,
And twice six thousand foot, and like a Crescent,
Stood for the signal, you: (that showed your self
A sound old soldier) thinking it not fit
To give your enemy the ods, and honor
Of the first stroke, commanded de la Guiche,
To let f^^e all his cannans, that did pierse
The adu^rse thickest squadrons, and had shot
Nine volleies ere the foe had once given fire:
Your troop was charged, and when your dukes old father,
Met with th'affailants, and their Grove of Reiters
Repulst so fiercely, made them turn their beards
And rallie up themselves behind their troops;
Fresh forces seeing your troops a little seuerd,
From that part first assaulted, gave it charge,
Which then, this duke made good, seconds his father,
Beats through and through the enemies greatest strength,
And breaks the rest like Billows against a rock
And there the heart of that huge battle broke.

The heart but now came on, in that strong body,
Of twice two thousand horse, lead by Du Maine
Which (if I would be glorious) I could say
I first encountered.

How did he take in,
Beaune in view of that invincible army
Lead by the Lord great Constable of Castile?
Autun, and Nuis: in Burgundy chaste away,
Vicount l'auannes troops before Dijon,
And puts himself in, and there that was won.

If you would only give me leave my Lord,
I would do right to him, yet must not give.

A league from Fountain Francois, when you sent him,
To make discovery of the Castile army,
When he descern'd it was it (with wondrous wisdom
Ioinde to his spirit) he seemed to make retreat,
But when they pressed him, and the Barron of Lux,
Set on their charge so hotely, that his horse,
Was slain, and he most dangerously engaged,
Then turned your brave duke head, and (with such ease
As does an Echo beat back violent sounds,
With their own forces) he, (as if a wall
Start suddenly before them) pasht them all
Flat, as the earth, and there was that field won.

Y^are all the field wide.

O, I ask you pardon,
The strength of that field yet lay in his back,
Upon the foes part; and what is to come.
Of this your Marshal, now your worthy Duke
Is much beyond the rest: for now he sees
A sort of horse troops, issue from the woods,
In number nere twelve hunderd: and retyring
To tell you that the entire army followed,
Before he could relate it, he was forc^t
To turn head, and receive the maine assault
Of five horse troops: only with twenty horse:
The first he met, he tumbled to the earth,
And brake through all, not daunted with two wounds,
One on his head, another on his breast,
The blood of which, drowned all the field in doubt:
Your majesty himself was then engaged,
Your power not yet arrived, and up you brought
The little strength you had: a cloud of foes,
Ready to burst in storms about your ears:
Three squadrons rusht against you, and the first,
You took so fiercely, that, you beat their thoughts
Out of their bosoms, from the urged fight:
The second, all amazed you overthrew,
The third dispersed, with five and twenty horse
Left of the fourscore that persude the chase:
And this brave conquest, now your Marshall seconds
Against two squadrons, but with fifty horse,
One after other he defeates them both,
And made them run, like men whose heels were tript,
And pitch their heads, in their great generals lap:
And him he sets on, as he had been shot
Out of a Cannan: beats him into route,
And as a little brook being ouerrunne
With a black torrent; that bears all things down,
His fury ouertakes, his fomy back,
Loded with Cattaile, and with stackes of Corn,
And makes the miserable Plowman mourn;
So was du Maine surchardgd, and so Byron
Flow d over all his forces; every drop
Of his lost blood, bought with a worthy man;
And, only with a hundred Gentlemen
He won the place, from fifteen hundred horse;

He won the place?

On my word, so it is said:

Fie you have been extremely misinformed.

I only tell your highness what I heard,
I was not there; and though I have been rude,
With wonder of his valor, and presum^d,
To keep his merit in his full carire,
Not hearing you, when yours made such a thunder;
Pardon my fault, since it was t'extoll your servant;
But, is it not most true, that twixt ye both,
So few achiu'd, the conquest of so many?

It is a truth, must make me ever thankful.
But not performd by him, was not I there?
Commanded him, and in the maine assault,
Made him but second?

He Is the capital soldier,
That lives this day in holy Christendom,
Except your highness, always except Plato.

We must not give to one, to take from many,
For (not to praise our countrymen) here served,
The General My Lor. Norris, sent from England:
As great a captain as the world affords:
One fit to lead, and fight for Christendom;
Of more experience; and of stronger brain;
As valiant for abiding; In Command,
On any sudden; upon any ground
And in the form of all occasions
As ready, and as profitably, dauntles;
And hear was then another; Collonell Williams,
A worthy Captain; and more like the Duke,
Because he was less temperate then the General;
And being familliar with the man you praise,
(Because he knew him haughty and incapable,
Of all comparison) would compare with him,
And hold his swelling valor to the mark,
Justice had set in him, and not his will:
And as in open vessels filld with water,
And on men's shoulders borne, they put treene cups,
To keep the wild and slippery element,
From washing over: follow all his Swayes
And tickle aptnes to exceed his bounds,
And at the Brym contain him: so this knight,
Swum in Byron, and held him, but to right.
But leave these hot comparisons, he is mine own,
And then what I possess, I Will more be known,

All this shall to the duke, I fisht for this.

A fained passion in his hearing now,
(Which he thinks I perceive not) making conscience,
Of the revolt that he has vrdgd to me,
Which now he means to prosecute would sound,
How deep he stands affected with that scruple.
As when the Moon has comforted the Night,
And set the world in silver of her light,
The Planets, Asterisims and whole state of Heaven,
In beams of gold desending; all the winds,
Bound up in caves, chargd not to drive abroad,
Their cloudy heads; an universal peace,
Proclaimd in scilence of the quiet earth.
Soon as her hot and dry fumes are let loose,
Storms and clouds mixing; suddenly put out.
The eyes of all those glories: The creation,
Turned into Chaos, and we then desire,
For all our joy of life, the death of sleep;
So when the glories of our lives, men's loves,
Clear consciences, our fames, and loyalties,
That did us worthy comfort, are eclipsd,
Grief and disgrace invade us; and for all,
Our night of life besides, our Misery craves,
Dark earth would open and hide us in our graves,

How Strange is this?

What? did your highness hear?

Both heard and wonderd, that your wit and spirit.
And proffit in experience of the slaueries,
Imposed on us; in those mere politic terms,
Of love, fame, loyalty, can be carried up,
To such a height of ignorant conscience;
Of cowerdise, and dissolution,
In all the freeborn powers of royal man*
You that have made way through all the guards,
Of Jealous State; and seen on both your sides,
The pikes points chardging heaven to let you pass,
Will you, (in flying with a Scrupulouse wing,
Above those pikes to heauen-ward) fall on them?
This is like men, that (spirrited with wine,)
Pass dangerouse places safe; and die for fear,
With only thought of them, being simply sober;
We must (in passing to our wished ends,
Through things called good and bad) be like the air,
That euenly interposd betwixt the seas,
And the opposed Element of fire;
At either touches, but pertakes with neither;
Is neither hot, nor cold, but with a slight.
And harmless temper mixed of both the exstreames;

It Is shrode.

There is no truth of any good
To be descernd on earth: and by conversion,
Naught therefore simply bad: But as the stuff,
Prepared for Arras pictures, is no Picture,
Till it be formd, and man has cast the beams,
Of his imaginouse fancy through it,
In forming ancient Kings and conquerors,
As he conceiues they looked, and were attirde,
Though they were nothing so: so all things here,
Have all their price set down, from men's concepts,
Which make all terms and actions, good, or bad,
And are but pliant, and wel-coloured threads,
Put into fained images of truth:
To which, to yield, and kneel, as truth pure kings,
That pulled us down with clear truth of their Gospel,
Were Superstition to be hist to hell.

Believe it* this is reason;

It Is the says,
Of reason and of wisdom.

You persuade,
As if you could create: what man can shun,
The serches, and compressions of your graces.

We must have these lures when we hawke for friends,
And wind about them like a subtle River,
That (seeming only to run on his course)
Does search yet, as he runs; and still finds out,
The easiest parts of entry on the shore;
Glyding so slyly by, as scarce it touched,
Yet still eats some thing in it: so must those,
That have large fields, and currants to dispose.
Come, let us ioyue our streams, we must run far.
And have but little time: The duke Sauoy,
Is shortly to be gone, and I must needs,
Make you well known to him,

But has your highness,
Some enterprise of value joined with him?

With him and greater persons?

I will creep.
Upon my bosom in your Princely service,
Vouch-safe to make me known. I hear there lives not,
So kind, so bounty full, and wise a Prince,
But in your own excepted excellence.

He shall both know, and love you: are you mine?

I take the honor of it, on my knee,
And hope to quite it with your Majesty.

La Fin, is in the right; and will obtain;
He draws with his weight; and like a plummet
That swaies a door, with falling of, pulls after,

Thus will Laffin be brought a Stranger to you,
By him he leads; he conquers that is conquered,
That's sought, as hard to win, that sues to be won.

But is my Painter warnd to take his picture.
When he shall see me, and present Laffin?

He is (my Lord) and (as your highness willd)
All we will press about him* and admire,
The royal promise of his rare aspect,
As if he heard not.

Twill inflame him.
Such tricks the Archduke vsd to extol his greatness,
Which complements though plain men hold absurd,
And a mere remedy for desire of Greatness.
Yet great men use them; as they eat Potatoes,
High Coollises, and potions to excite
The lust of their ambition: and this Duke;
You know is noted in his natural garb
Extremely glorious; who will therefore bring
An appetite expecting such a bait;
He comes, go instantly, and fetch the Painter.

All honor to your heighnesse,

It Is most true*
All honors flow to me, in you their Ocean;
As welcome worthyest duke, as if my marquisate,
Were circkl'd with you in these amorous arms;

I sorrow Sir I could not bring it with me*
That I might so supply the fruitelesse complement,
Of only visiting your excellence,
With which the king now sends me to entertain you,
Which notwithstanding does confer this good,
That it has given me some small time to show,
My gratitude for the many secret bounties,
I have (by this your Lord Ambassador)
Felt from your heighnesse and in short, to assure you,
That all my most deserts are at your service.

Had the king sent me by you half his kingdom,
It were not half so welcome;

For defect.
Of whatsoever in my self, (my Lord,)
I here commend to your most Princely Service
This honored friend of mine;

Your name I pray you Sir.

Laffin, my Lord

Laffin? Is this the man,
That you so recommended to my Love?

The same my Lord,

You Are next my Lord the duke,
The most desird of all men. O my Lord,
The King and I, have had a mighty conflict,
About your conflicts, and your matchles worth,
In military virtues; which I put
In Balance with the continent of France,
In all the peace and fasty it enioyes.
And made even weight with all he could put in
Of all men's else; and of their own deserts,

Of all men's else? would he weigh other men's,
With my deseruings,

I upon my life,
The English General, the Mylor' Norris,
That served amongst you here, he paralleld
With you, at all parts, and in some preferred him,
And Collonell Williams (a Welsh Collonell)
He made a man, that at your most containd you:
Which the Welsh Herrald of their praise, the Cucko.
Would scarce have put, in his monology,
In jest, and said with reverence to his merits,

With reverence? Reverence skornes him: by the spoil,
Of all her Merits in me, he shall rue it;
Did ever Curtian Gullffe play such a part?
Had Curtius been so used, if he had brook't,
That rauenons whirlepoole, pourd his solid spirrits,
Through earth dissolved sinews, stopped her veins,
And rose with saved Rome, upon his back,
As I swum pooles of fire, and Gullfs of brass,
To save my country? thrust this venturous arm,
Beneath her ruins; took her on my neck,
And set her safe on her appeased shore?
And opes the king, a fouler bog then this,
In his so rotten bosom, to devour
Him that deuourd, what else had swalloed him
In a detraction, so with spite embrewed,
And drown such good in such ingratitude?
My spirrit as yet, but stooping to his rest,
Shines hotly in him, as the Sun in clouds,
Purpled, and made proud with a peaceful Even:
But when I thoroughly set to him; his cheeks,
Will (like those clouds) forgo their color quite,
And his whole blaze, smoke into endless night,

Nay nay, we must have no such gall my Lord,
Overflow our friendly liue^s: my relation,
Only delivers my enflamed zeal
To your religious merits; which me thinks,
Should make your highness canonizd, a Saint.

What had his arms been* without my arm,
That with his motion, made the whole field move?
And this held up, we still had victory.
When over charged with number, his few friends,
Retired amazed, I set them on assurd,
And what rude ruin seas'd on I confirmed;
When I left leading, all his army reeld,
One fell on other foul, and as the Cyclop
That having lost his eye, struck every way,
His blows directed to no certain scope;
Or as the soul departed from the body,
The body wants coherence in his parts,
Can not consist, but sever, and dissolve;
So I removed once, all his armies shook,
Panted, and fainted, and were ever flying,
Like wandering pulses sper^t through bodies dying,

It cannot be denied, it is all so true,
That what seems arogance, is desert in you,

What monstrous humors feed a Princes blood,
Being bad to good men, and to bad men good?

Well let these contradictions pass (my lord,)
Till they be reconciled, or put in form,
By power given to your will, and you present,
The fashion of a prefect government;
In mean space but a word, we have small time,
To spend in private, which I wish may be
With all advantage taken; Lord Laffin.

Is It not a face of excellent presentment,
Though not so amorouse with pure white, and red,
Yet is the whole proportion singular;

That ever I beheld,

It has good lines,
And tracts drawn through it: The purfle, rare,

I heard the famous and right learned Earl,
And Archbishop of Lions Peirse Pinac,
Who was reported to have wondrouse Judgment
In men's events, and natures, by their looks:
(Upon his death bed, visited by this duke)
He told his sister, when his grace was gone,
That he had never yet obserud a face,
Of worse presage then this: and I will swear,
That (something seen in Phisiognomy)
I do not find in all the rules he gives
One slendrest blemish tending to mishap,
But (on the opposite part) as we may see,
On trees late blossomd, when all frosts are past,
How they are taken and what will be fruit:
So, on this tree of Scepters, I discern
How it is laden with apparances,
Rules answering Rules; and glances, crowned with glances;

What, does he take my picture?

I my Lord.

Your Highness will excuse me; I will give you
My likeness put in Statue, not in picture;
And by a Statuary of mine own,
That can in Brass express the wit of man,
And in his form, make all men see his virtues:
Others that with much strictness imitate,
The something stooping carriage of my neck,
The voluble, and mild radiance of mine eyes,
Never observe my Masculine aspect,
And Lyon-like instinct, it shaddoweth:
Which Envy cannot say, is flattery:
And I will have my Image promised you,
Cut in such matter, it shall ever last;
Where it shall stand, fixed with eternal roots,
And with a most unmoved gravity;
For I will have the famous mountain Oros,
That looks out of the Duchy where I govern,
(Into your highness Dukedom) first made yours,
And then with such inimitable art
Expressed and handled; chiefly from the place
Where most conspicuously, he shows his face,
That though it keep the true form of that hill
In all his longitudes, and latitudes,
His height, his distances, and full proportion,
Yet shall it clearly bear my counterfaite,
Both in my face and all my lineaments:
And every man shall say, this is Byron.
Within my left hand, I will hold a City,
Which is the City Amiens; at whose siedge
I served so memorably: from my right,
I Will power an endless flood, into a Sea
Raging beneath me; which shall intimate
My ceaselesse service, drunk up by the King
As the Ocean drinks up rivers, and makes all
Bear his proud title; Iuory, Brass and Goulde,
That thieves may purchase; and be bought and sold,
Shall not be used about me; lasting worth
Shall only set the duke of Byron forth;

O that your statuary could express you,
With any nerenesse to your own instructions;
That statue would I prise past all the jewels
Within my cabinet of Beatrice,
The memory of my Grandame Portugal;
Most royal duke: we can not long endure
To be thus private, let us then conclude,
With this great resolution: that your wisdom,
Will not forget to cast a pleasing veil
Over your anger; that may hide each glance,
Of any notice taken of your wrong,
And show your self the more obsequious.
It Is but the virtue of a little patience,
There are so often attempts made against his person,
That sometimes they may speed, for they are palnts
That spring the more for cutting, and at last
Will cast their wished shadow; mark ere long,
See who comes here my Lord, as now no more,
Now must we turn out stream another way;
My Lord, I humbly thank his majesty,
That he would grace my idle time spent here
With entertainment of your princely person;
Which, worthily, he keeps for his own bosom.
My Lord, the duke Nemours? and Count Soisson?
Your honors have been bountifully done me
In often visitation: let me pray you,
To see some jewels now, and help my choice:
In making up a present for the King.

Your highness shall much grace us.

I am doubtful
That I have much incenst the duke Byron,
With praising the Kings worthiness in arms
So much past all men.

He deserves it, highly.

What wrongs are these, laid on me by the King,
To equal others worths in war, with mine;
Endure this, and be turned into his Moile
To bear his sumptures: honored friend be true,
And we will turn these torrents, hence.

Why suffer you that ill aboding vermin,
To breed so near your bosom? be assurde,
His hants are omenous, not the throtes of Ravens,
Spent on infected house^; houles of dogs,
When no sound stirs, at midnight; apparitions,
And strokes of spirits, clad in blackmens shapes:
Or ougly women's: the adverse decrees
Of constellations, no^ security,
In vicious peace, are surer fatal vshers
Of femall mischiefs, and mortallities,
Then this prodigious feend is, where he fawnes:
La fiend, and not Laffin, he should be called.

Be what he will, men in themselves entire,
March safe with naked feet on coals of fire:
I build not outward, nor depend on proppes,
Nor choose my consort by the common ear:
Nor by the Moone-shine, in the grace of Kings:
So rare are true deseruers, loved or known,
That men loved vulgarely, are ever none:
Nor men graced seruilely, for being spots
In Princes trains, though borne even with their crowns;
The Stalion power, has such a beesome tail,
That it sweepes all from justice, and such filth
He bears out in it, that men mere exempt,
Are merely cleerest men will shortly buie
Friends from the prison, or the pillorie,
Rather then honors markets. I fear none,
But foul Ingratitude, and Detraction,
In all the brood of villainy.

No? not treason?
Be circumspect, for to a credulous eye,
He comes invisible, veiled with flattery,
And flatereis look like friends, as Woolues, like Dogs.
And as a glorious Poem fronted well
With many a goodly Herrald of his praise,
So far from hate of praises to his face,
That he prays men to praise him, and they ride
Before, with trumpets in their mouths, proclayming
Life to the holy fury of his lines:
All drawn, as if with one eye he had leerd,
On his loved hand, and led it by a rule;
That his plumes only Imp the Muses wings,
He sleeps with them, his head is napt with baies,
His lips break out with Nectar, his tunde feet
Are of the great last, the perpetual motion,
And he puffed with their empty breath believes
Full merit, eased those passions of wind,
Which yet serve, but to praise, and cannot merit,
And so his fury in their air expires:
So de Laffin, and such corrupted Herralds,
Hirde to encorage, and to glorify
May force what breath they will into their cheeks
Fitter to blow up bladders, then full men:
Yet may puff men to, with persuasions
That they a^e Gods in worth; and may rise Kings
With treading on their noises; yet the worthiest,
From only his own worth receives his spirit
And right is worthy bound to any merit;
Which right, shall you have ever; leave him then,
He follows none but marked* and wretched men;
And now for England you shall go my lord,
Our Lord Ambassador to that matchless Queen;
You never had a voyage of such pleasure
Honor, and worthy objects: There Is a Queen
Where nature keeps her state, and state her Court,
Wisdom her study, Conntinence her fort,
Where Magnanimity, Humanity:
Firmness in counsel and integrity:
Grace to her porest subjects: Majesty
To awe the greatest, have respects divine,
And in her each part, all the virtues shine.

Enjoy your will a while, I may have mine.
Wherefore (before I part to this embassage)
I Will be resolved by a Magician
That dwells hereby, to whom i will go disguisde,
And show him my births figure, set before:
By one of his profession, of the which
I Will crave his judgment, fayning I am sent
From some great personage, whose nativity,
He wishes should be censurd by his skill.
But on go my plots, be it good or ill.
This hour by all rules of Astrology,
Is dangerous to my person, if not deadly.
How haples is our knowledge to fore-tel
And not be able to prevent a mischief,
O the strange difference twixt us and the stars:
They work with inclynations strong and fatal
And nothing know; and we know all there working
And naught can do, or nothing can prevent?
Rude ignorance is beastly, knowledge wretched:
The heavenly powers envy what they Enjoin:
We are commanded t'imitate there natures,
In making all our ends eternity:
And in that imitation we are plagued,
And worsse then they esteemd, that have no souls,
But in their nostrils, and like beasts expire;
As they do that are ignorant of arts,
By drowning there eternal parts in sense,
And sensual affectations: while we live
Our good parts take away, the more they give.

The forts that favorites hold in Princes hearts,
In common subjects loves; and their own strengths
Are not so sure, and vnexpugnable,
But that the more they are presumed upon,
The more they fail; daily and hourly proof,
Tells us prosperity is at highest degree
The founte and handle of calamity:
Like dust before a whirle-winde those men fly,
That prostrate on the grounds of fortune lie:
And being great (like trees that broadest sproyte)
Their own top-heauy state grubs up their root.
These apprehensions startle all my powers,
And arm them with suspicion against themselves,
In my late proiects; I have cast my self
Into the arms of others; and will see
It they will let me fall; or toss me up
Into th'affected compass of a throne,
God save you sir.

You Are welcome friend: what would you?

I would entreat you, for some crowns I bring,
To give your judgment of this figure cast.
To know by his nativity there seen;
What sort of end the person shall endure,
Who sent me to you, and whose birth it is.

I Will herein do my best, in your desire;
The man is raisd out of a good descent,
And nothing oulder then your self I think;
Is it not you?

I will not tell you that:
But tell me on what end he shall arrive.

My son, I see, that he whose end is cast
In this set figure, is of Noble parts,
And by his military valor raisde,
To princely honors; and may be a king,
But that I see a Caput Algol here,
That hinders it I fear.

A Caput Algol?
What Is that I pray?

Forbear to ask me, son,
You bid me speak, what fear bids me conceal.

You have no cause to fear, and therefore speak.

You Will rather wish you had been ignorant,
Then be instructed in a thing so ill.

Ignorance is an idle salve for ill,
And therefore do not urge me to enforce,
What I would freely know: for by the skill
Shown in thy aged haytes, i will lay thy brain
Here scattered at my feet, and seek in that,
What safely thou must utter with thy tongue,
If thou deny it.

Will you not allow me
To hold my peace? what less can I desire?
If not, be pleased with my constrained speech.

Was ever man yet punished for expressing
What he was chargde? be free, and speak the wurst.

Then briefly this; the man has lately done
An action that will make him loose his head.

Cursed be thy throat and soul, Raven, Shriech-owle, hag.

O hold, for heavens sake hold.

Hold on, I will,
Vault, and contractor of all horrid sounds,
Trumpet of all the miseries in hell,
Of my confusions; of the shameful end
Of all my services; witch, fiend, accursed
For ever be the poison on thy tongue,
And let the black sum of thy venomd breath,
Infect the air, shrink heaven, put out the stars,
And rain so fell and blew a plague on earth,
That all the world may falter with my fall.

Pity my age, my Lord.

Out prodigy,
Remedy of pity, mine of flint,
Whence with my nails and feet, i will dig enough,
Horror, and sauadge cruelty, to build
Temples to Massacre: dam of devils take thee,
Had thou no better end to crown my parts.
The Bulls of Colchos, nor his triple neck,
That howles out Earthquakes; the most mortal vapors,
That ever stifled and struck dead the fowls,
That flew at never such a sightly pitch,
Could not have burnt my blood so.

I told truth,
And could have flatterd you.

O that thou had;
Would I had given thee twenty thousand crowns
That thou had flatterd me: there is no joy on earth,
Never so rational, so pure, and holy,
But is a Iester, Parasite, a Whore,
In the most worthy parts, with which they please,
A drunkenness of foul, and a disease.

I knew you not.

Peace dog of Pluto, peace,
Thou knewst my end to come, not me here present:
Pox of your halting humane knowledges;
O death! how far off have thou killed? how soon
A man may know too much though never nothing?
Spite of the Stars, and all Astrology,
I will not loose my head: or (...) I do,
A hundred thousand heads shall off before.
I am a nobler substance them the Stars,
And shall the baser overrule the better?
Or are they better, since they are the bigger?
I have a will, and faculties of choice,
To do, or not to do: and reason why,
I do, or not do this; the sta^res have none,
They know not why they shine, more then this Taper,
Nor how they work, nor what: i will change my course,
I Will peece-meale pull, the frame of all my thoughts,
And cast my will into another mould:
And where are all your Caput Algols then?
Your Plannets all, being underneath the earth,
At my nativity: what can they do?
Malignant in aspects? in bloody houses?
Wild fire consume them; one poor cup of wine,
More then I use, that my weak brain will bear,
Shall make them drunk and reele out of their spheres,
For any certain act they can enforce.
O that mine arms were wings, that I might fly,
And pluck out of their hearts, my destiny!
I Will wear those golden Spurs upon my heels,
And kick at fate; be free all worthy spirits,
And stretch your selves, for greatness and for height:
Untruss your slaueries, you have height enough,
Beneath this steep heaven to use all your reaches,
It Is too far off, to let you, or respect you.
Give me a spirit that on this life's rough sea,
Loves to have his sails filled with a lusty wind,
Even till his Sayle-yeards tremble; his Masts crack,
And his rapt ship run on her side so low
That she drinks water, and her keele plowes air;
There is no danger to a man, that knows
What life and death is: there is not any law,
Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful
That he should stoop to any other law.
He goes before them, and commands them all,
That to himself is a law rational.

The duke of Byron is returned from England,
And (as they say) was Princely entertainde,
Schoold by the matchless Queen there, who I hear
Spoke most divinely; and would gladly hear,
Her speech reported.
I can serve your turn,
As one that speaks from others not from her,
And thus it is reported at his parting,
THus Monsieur Du Byron you have beheld,
Our Court proportioned to our little kingdom.
In every entertainment; yet our mind,
To do you all the rites of your repair,
Is as unbounded as the ample air.
What idle pains have you bestowd to see
A poor old woman? who in nothing lives
More, then in true affections, borne your king;
And in the perfect knowledge she has learned,
Of his good knights, and servants of your sort.
We thank him that he keeps the memory
Of us and all our kindness; but must say,
That it is only kept; and not laid out
To such affectionate profit as we wish;
Being so much set on fire with his deserts,
That they consume us; not to be restorde
By your presentment of him; but his person;
And we had thought, that he whose virtues fly
So beyond wonder, and the reach of thought,
Should check at eight hours sail, and his high spirit
That stoopes to fear, less then the Poles of heaven;
Should doubt an under billow of the Sea,
And (being a Sea) be sparing of his streams;
And I must blame all you that may advise him;
That (having helped him through all martial dangers)
You let him stick, at the kind rites of peace,
Considering all the forces I have sent,
To set his martial seas up in firm walls,
On both his sides for him to pass at pleasure;
Did plainly open him a guarded way
And led in Nature to this friendly shore,
But here is nothing worth his personal sight,
Here are no walled Cities; for that Crystal
Sheds with his light, his hardness, and his height
About our thankful person, and our Realm;
Whose only aid, we ever yet desirde;
And now I see, the help we sent to him,
Which should have swum to him in our own blood,
Had it been needful; (our affections
Being more given to his good, then he himself)
Ends in the actual right it did his state,
And ours is slighted; all our worth is made,
The common-stock, and banck; from whence are served
All men's occasions; yet (thanks to heaven)
Their gratitudes are drawn dry; not our bounties.
And you shall tell your King, that he neglects
Old friends for new; and sets his soothed Ease
Above his honor; Marshals policy
In rank before his justice; and his profit
Before his royalty: his humanity gone,
To make me no repaiment of mine own.

What answered the Duke?

In this sort.
Your highness sweet speech has no sharper end,
Then he would wish his life; if he neglected,
The least grace you have named; but to his wish,
Much power is wanting: the green roots of war,
Not yet so close cut up, but he may dash
Against their relickes to his utter ruin,
Without more near eyes, fixed upon his feet,
Then those that look out of his countries soil,
And this may well excuse his personal presence,
Which yet he often has longed to set by yours:
That he might immitate the Majesty,
Which so long peace has practisde, and made full,
In your admired appearance; to illustrate
And rectify his habit in rude war.
And his will to be here, must needs be great,
Since heaven has thron'de so true a royalty here,
That he thinks no king absolutely crownde,
Whose temples have not stood beneath this sky,
And whose height is not hardened with these stars,
Whose influences for this altitude,
Distild, and wrought in with this temperate air,
And this division of the Element
Have with your reign, brought: forth more worthy spirits,
For counsel, valor, height of wit, and art,
Then any other region of the earth:
Or were brought forth to all your ancestors,
And as a cunning Orator, reserues
His fairest similies, best-adorning figures,
Chief matter, and most moving arguments
For his conclusion; and does then supply
His ground-streames laid before, glides over them,
Makes his full depth seen through; and so takes up,
His audience in Aplawses past the clouds.
So in your government, conclusiue nature,
(Willing to end her Excellence in earth
When your foot shall be set upon the stars)
Shows all her Sovereign Beauties, Ornaments,
Virtues, and Raptures; ouertakes her works
In former Empires, makes them but your foyles,
Swells to her full Sea, and again does drown
The world, in admiration of your crown.

He did her (at all parts) confessed right.

She took it yet, but as a part of Court-ship,
And said, he was the subtle Orator,
To whom he did too gloriously resemble,
Nature in her, and in her government,
He said, he was no Orator, but a Soldier,
More then this air, in which you breath has made me,
My studious love, of your rare government,
And simple truth, which is most eloquent,
Your Empire is so amply absolute,
That even your Theaters show more comely rule,
True noblesse, royalty, and happiness
Then others courts: you make all state before
Utterly obsolete; all to come, twice sod.
And therefore does my royal Sovereign wish
Your years may prove, as vital, as your virtues,
That (standing on his Turrets this way turned,
Ordring and fixing his affairs by yours)
He may at last, on firm grounds, pass your Seas,
And see that Maiden-sea of Majesty,
In whose chaste arms, so many kingdoms lie.

When came she to her touch of his ambition?

In this speech following, which I thus remember.
If I hold any merit worth his presence,
Or any part of that, your Courtship gives me,
My subjects have bestowd it; some in counsel,
In action some, and in obedience all;
For none knows, with such proof as you my Lord,
How much a subject may renown his Prince,
And how much Princes of their subjects hold;
In all the services that ever subject
Did for his Sovereign; he that best deserved
Must (in comparison) except, Byron;
And to win this prise clear; without the maimes
Commonly given men by ambition,
When all their parts lie open to his view,
Shows continence, past their other excellence,
But for a subject to affect a kingdom,
Is like the Cammell, that of Jove begd horns,
And such mad-hungrie men, as well may eat,
Hot coals of fire, to feed their natural heat;
For, to aspire to competence with your king
What subject is so gross, and Gyantly?
He having now a Daulphine borne to him,
Whose birth, ten days before, was dreadfully
Vsherd with Earthquakes, in most parts of Europe,
And that gives all men, cause enough to fear
All thought of competition with him.
Commend us good my Lord, and tell our Brother
How much we joy, in that his royal issue,
And in what prayers, we raise our heart to heaven,
That in more terror to his foes, and wonder
He may drink Earthquakes, and devour the thunder,
So we admire your valor, and your virtues,
And ever will contend, to win their honor.
Then spoke she to Crequie, and Prince D' Auergne,
And gave all gracious farewels; when Byron
Was thus encountered by a Councellor*
Of great and eminent name, and matchless merit:
I think (my Lord) your princely Daulphin bears
Arion in his Cradle, through your kingdom,
In the sweet Music joy strikes from his birth.
He answered; and good right; the cause commands it.
But (said the other) had we a fifth Henry,
To claim his old right: and one man to friend,
Whom you well know my Lord, that for his friendship
Were promised the Vice-royaltie of France,
We would not doubt of conquest, in despite
Of all those windy Earthquakes. He replied;
Treason was never guide to English conquests,
And therefore that doubt shall not fright our Daulphine;
Nor would I be the friend to such a foe,
For all the royalties in Christendom.
Fix there your foot (said he) I only give
False fire, and would be loathe to shoot you of:
He that winnes Empire with the loss of faith,
Out-buies it; and will banck-route; you have laid
A brave foundation, by the hand of victory:
Put not the roof to fortune, foolish statuaries,
That under little Saints suppose, great bases
Make less, to sense, the Saints; and so where fortune,
Aduanceth vile minds, to states great and noble,
She much more exposes them to shame,
Not able to make good, and fill their bases,
With a conformed structure; I have found,
(Thanks to the blesser of my search) that counsels,
Held to the line of Justice; still produce,
The surest states, and greatest, being sure,
Without which fit assurance, in the greatest,
As you may see a mighty promontorie
More digd and vnder-eaten, then may warrant,
A safe supportance, to his hanging brows,
All passengers avoid him, shun all ground
That lies within his shadow, and bear still
A flying eye upon him, so great men
Corrupted in their ground, and building out.
Too swelling fronts, for their foundations;
When most they should be propt, are most forsaken,
And men will rather thrust into the storms
Of better grounded States, then take a shelter
Beneath their ruinous, and fearful weight;
Yet they, so ouersee, their faulty bases,
That they remain securer in conceit:
And that security, does worse presage
Their nere distructions, then their eaten grounds;
And therefore heaven it self is made to us
A perfect Hierogliphick to express,
The Idleness of such security,
And the grave labor, of a wise distrust,
In both sorts of the all-enclying stars;
Where all men note this difference in their shyning,
As plain as they distinguish either hand;
The ^ixt stars mauer, and the erring, stand.

How took he this so worthy admonition?

Gravely applied (said he) and like the man,
Whom all the world says, ouerrules the stars;
Which are divine books to us; and are read
By understanders only, the true objects,
And chief companions of the truest men;
And (though I need it not) I thank your counsel,
That never yet was idle, But spherelike,
Still mooues about, and is the continent
To this blessed I Will.

The Circkle of this ambassie is closde,
For which I long have longed, for mine own ends;
To see my faithful, and leave courtly friends,
To whom I came (me thought) with such a spirit,
As you have seen, a lusty courser show,
That has been long time at his manger tied;
High fead, alone, and when (his headstall broken)^
He runs his prison, like a trumpet neighs,
Cuts air, in high curuets, and shakes his head:
(With wanton stopings, twixt his forelegs) mocking
The heavy center; spreds his flying crest,
Like to an Ensign, hedge, and ditches leaping,
Till in the fresh meat, at his natural food
He sees free fellows, and has met them free:
And now (good friend) I would be feign informed,
What our right Princely Lord, the duke of Sauoy
Has thought on, to employ my coming home.

To try the Kings trust in you, and withal,
How hot he trailes on our conspiracy:
He first would have you, beg the government,
Of the important Citadell of Bourg:
Or to place in it, any you shall name:
Which will be wondrous fit, to march before,
His other purposes; and is a fort
He rates, in love, above his patrimony;
To make which fortress worthy of your suite:
He vows (if you obtain it) to bestow
His third fair daughter, on your excellence,
And hopes the King will not deny it you.

Deny it me? deny me such a suite?
Who will he grant, if he deny it me.

He Will find some politic shift to do it, I fear.

What shift? or what evasion can he find,
What one patch is there in all policies shop,
(That botcher up of Kingdoms) that can mend
The brack betwixt us, any way denying.

That's at your peril:

Come, he dares not do it.

Dares not? presume not so; you know (good duke)
That all things he thinks fit to do, he dares.

By heaven I wonder at you, I will ask it,
As sternely, and secure of all repulse
As the ancient Persians did when they implorde,
Their idol fire to grant them any boon;
With which they would descend into a flood,
And threaten there to quench it, if they faild,
Of that they ask't it:

Said like your Kings King;
Cold has no act in depth, nor are suites wrought
(Of any high price) that are coldly sought:
I Will have, and with your courage, comfort Sauoy.

I am your friend (my Lord) and will deserve
That name, with following any course you take;
Yet (for your own sake) I could wish your spirit
Would let you spare all broad terms of the King,
Or, on my life you will at last repent it:

What can he do?

All that you can not fear.

You fear too much, be by, when next I see him,
And see how I will urge him in this suite,
He comes, mark you, that think
He will not grant it.
I am become a suitor to your highness.

For what, my Lord, it is like you shall obtain.

I do not much doubt that; my services,
I hope have more strength in your good conceit
Then to receive repulse, in such requests.

What is it?

That you would bestow on one whom I shall name,
The keeping of the Citadell of Bourg,

Excuse me sir, I must not grant you that.

Not grant me this suit?

It is not fit I should;
You are my governor in Burgundy,
And Province governors, that command in chief,
Ought not to have the charge of fortresses;
Besides, it is the chief key of my kingdom,
That opens toward Italy, and must therefore,
Be given to one that has imediatly
Dependence on us.

These are wondrous reasons,
Is not a man depending on his merits
As fit to have the charge of such a key
As one that merely hangs upon your humors?

Do not enforce your merits so your self;
It takes away their luster, and reward.

But you will grant my suite?

I swear I cannot
Keeping the credit of my brain and place.

Will you deny me then?

I am infor^st;
I have no power, more then your self in things
That are beyond my reason.

Then my self?
That Is a strange slight in your comparison;
Am I become the example of such men
As have lest power? Such a diminitiue?
I was comparatiue in the better sort;
And such a King as you, would say I cannot,
Do such; or such a thing; were I as great
In power as he; even that indefinite he,
Expressed me full: This Moon is strangely changed;

How can I help it? would you have a King
That has a white beard; have so green a brain?

A plague of brain; what does this touch your brain?
You must give me more reason or I swear

Swear; what do you swear?

I Swear you wrong me,
And deal not like a King to jest, and slight,
A man that you should curiously reward;
Tell me of your gray beard? it is not gray
With care to recompense me, who eased your care.

You have been recompenc't, from head to foot.

With a distrusted dukedom: Take your dukedom
Bestowed on me again; It was not given
For any love, but fear, and force of shame;

Yet it was your honor; which if you respect not,
Why seek you this Adition?

Since this honor,
Would show you loved me to, in trusting me,
Without which love, and trust; honor is shame;
A very Pageant, and a property:
Honor, with all his Adiu^cts, I deserve,
And you quit my deserts, with your gray beard.

Since you expostulate the matter so;
I tell you plain; Another reason is
Why I am moved to make you this denial
That I suspect you to have had in^elligence
With my vowed enemies.

Misery of virtue,
Ill is made good, with worse? This reason poures
Poison, for Balm, into the wound you made;
You make me mad, and rob me of my soul,
To take away my tried love, and my Truth;
Which of my labors, which of all my wounds,
Which overthrow, which Battle won for you,
Breeds this suspicion? Can the blood of faith,
(Lost in all these to find it proof, and strength)
Beget disloya^ty? all my rain is fallen,
Into the horse-fayre; springing pooles and mire;
And not in thankful grounds, or fields of fruit;
Fall then before us, O thou flaming Crystal,
That art the uncorrupted Register
Of all men's merits: And remonstrate here,
The fights, the dangers, the affrights and horrors,
Whence I have r^^cu'd this unthankful King:
And show (commixt with them) the joys, the glories
Of his state then: Then his kind thoughts of me:
Then my deseruings: Now my infamy:
But I will be mine own King: I will see,
That all your Chronicles be filled with me,
That none but I, and my renowned Sire
Be said to win the memorable fields
Of Arques and Deep: and none b^t we of all
Kept you from dying there, in an Hospital;
None but my self, that won the day at Dreux:
A day of holy name, and needs, no night:
Nor none but I at Fountain Francois burst,
The heart strings of the leaguers; I alone,
Took Amiens in these arms and held her fast,
In spite of all the Pitchy fires she cast,
And clouds of bullets pourd upon my breast,
Till she showd yours; and took her natural form,
Only my self (married to victory)
Did people Artois, Dou^y, Picardie,
Bethune, and Saint Paul^, Bapaume, and Courcelles,
With her triumphant issue;

Ha ha ha,

O hold my Lord; for my sake, mighty Spirrit.

Respect, Reuendge, slaughter repaie for laughter,
Whats' grave in Earth, what awful? what abhord*
If my rage be ridiculouse? I will make it,
The law and rule of all things serious.
So long as such as he
Are suffered, soothed and wrest all right, to safty
So long is mischief gathering massacres,
For their cursed kingdoms; which I will prevent,
Laughter? I Will fright it from him, far as he,
Has cast irreuocable shame; which ever,
Bring found is lost and lost returns never;
Should Kings cast of their bounties, with their dangers?
He that can warm at fi^es, where virtue burns,
Hunt pleasure through her torments; nothing feel,
Of all his subjects suffer; but (long hid)
In wants, and miseries, and having past
Through all the grauest shapes, of worth and honor,
(For all Heroiq^e fashions to be learned,
By those hard lessons) show an antique vizard,
Who would not wish him rather hewd to nothing,
Then left so monstrous? slight my services?
Drown the dead noises of my sword, in laughter?
My blows, as but the passages of shadows,
Over the highest and most barraine hills,
And use me, like, no man; but as he took me
Into a desert, gasht with all my wounds,
Sustaind for him, and buried me in flies;
Forth vengeance then, and open wounds in him
Shall let in Spain, and Sauoy.

O my Lord,
This is to large a license given your fury;
Give time to it, what reason, suddenly,
Can not extend, respite does often supply.

While respite, holds revenge, the wrong redoubles,
And so the shame of sufferance, it torments me,
To think what I endure, at his shrunk hands,
That skornes the gift, of one pore fort to me:
That have subdued for him; O injury,
Forts, Cities, Countries, I, and yet my fury.

Byron?

My Lord? the King calls,

Turn I pray,
How now? from whence flow these distracted faces?
From what attempt return they? as disclayming,
Their late Heroique bearer? what, a pistall?
Why, good my Lord, can mirth make you so wrathful?

Mirth? it was mockery, a contempt; a scandal
To my renown for ever: a repulse,
As miserably cold, as Stygian water,
That from sincere earth issues, and does break
The strongest vessels, not to be containde,
But in the tough hoof of a pacient Ass.

My Lord, your judgment is not competent,
In this dissension, I may say of you;
As Fame says of the ancient Elea^s,
That, in the Olimpian contentions,
They ever were the iustest Arbitrators,
If none of them contended, nor were partie^;
Those that will moderate disputations well,
Must not themselves affect the coronet;
For as the air, containd within our ears:
If it be not in quiet; nor refrains,
Troubling our hearing, with offensive sounds;
But our affected instrument of hearing,
Repl^at with noise, and singings in it self,
It faithfully receives no other voices;
So, of all judgments, if within themselves
They suffer spleen, and are tumultuous;
They can not equal differences without them;
And this wind, that does sing so in your ears,
I know, is no disease bred in your self;
But whisperd in by others; who in swelling
Your veins with empty hope of much, yet able,
To perform nothing; are like shallow streams,
That make themselves so many heavens; to sight;
Since you may see in them, the Moon, and Stars,
The blew space of the air; as far from us,
(To our weak senses) in those shallow streams
As if they were as deep, as heaven is high;
Yet with your middle finger only, sound them,
And you shall pierce them to the very earth;
And therefore leave them, and be true to me
Or yow'le be left by all; or be like one
That in cold nights will needs have all the fire,
And there is held by others, and embraced
Only to burn him: your fire will be inward,
Which not another deluge can put out:
O Inocence the sacred amulet,
Against all the poisons of infirmity:
Of all misfortune, injury, and death,
That makes a man, in tune still in himself;
Free from the hell to be his own accuser,
Ever in quiet, endle, joy enjoying;
No strife, nor no sedition i^ his powers:
No motion in his will, against his reason,
No thought against thought, Nor (as twere in the confines
Of wishing, and repenting) does possess
Only a way ward, and tumultuose peace,
But (all parts in him, friendly and secure,
Fruitful of all best things in all worst Seasons)
He can with every wish, be in their plenty,
When, the infectious guilt of one foul crime,
Destroys the free content of all our time.

It Is all acknowlegd, and, (though all to late)
Here the short madness of my anger ends:
If ever I did good I locked it safe
In you, th'impregnable defense of goodness:
If ill, I press it with my penitent knees
To that unsounded depth, whence naught returns.

It Is music to mine ears: rise then for ever,
Quit of what guilt soever, till this hour,
And nothing touched in honor or in spirit,
Rise without flattery, rise by absolute merit.

Sir if it please you to be taught any Courthship take you to your stand:
Sauoy is at it with three Mistresses at once he loves each of them best, yet
All differently


For the time he has been here, he has talked a Volume greater then the
Turks A^caron; stand up close; his lips go still


Excuse me, excuse me; The King has ye all;


True Sir, in honorable subjection.


To the which we are bound by our loyallty.


Nay your excuse, your excuse, intend me for affection? you are all bearers of
his favors; and deny him not your opposition by night


You say rightly in that; for therein we oppose us to his command.


In the which he never yet pressed us.


Such is the be^edictio^ of our ^eace.


You take me still in flat misc^nstruction, and conceive not by me.


Therein we are strong in our own purposes; for it were something scandalous
for us to conceive by you


Though there might be question made of your fruitfulnes, yet dry weather in
harue^t dooes no harm


They will talk him into Sauoy; he begins to hunt down.


As the King is, and has been, a most admired, and the most unmatchable
soldier, so has he been, and is, a sole excellent, and vnp^ralelld Courtier


Pouvre Amy Mercy.


Your highness does the king but right sir.


And heaven shall bless you for that justice,
With plentiful store of want in Ladies affections.

You are cruel, and will not vouchsafe me audience to any conclusion.


Beseech your grace conclude, that we may present our curtsies to you, and give
you the adieu


It is said, the king will bring an army into Sauoy.


Truly we are not of his counsel of war.


Nay but vouchsafe me.


Vouchsafe him* vouchsafe him, else there is no play in it.


Well I vouchsafe your Grace.


Let the king bring an army into Sauoy, and I Will find him sport for forty
years


Would I were sure of that, I should then have a long gae, and a merry.


I think your Grace would play with his army at Balloone.


My faith, and that is a martial recreation.


It is next to impious courting.


I am not he that can set my Squadrons ouer-night, by midnight leap my horse,
curry seven miles, and by three, leap my mistress; return to mine army
again, and direct as I were infatigable, I am no such tough soldier


Your disparitie is believed sir.


And it is a piece of virtue to tell true.


Gods me, the king,


Well, I have said nothing that may offend.


It Is hoped so,


If there be any mercy in laughter.


I Will take my leave.
After the tedious stay my love has made,
(Most worthy to command our earthly zeal)
I come for pardon, and to take my leave;
Affirming though I reap no other good,
By this my voyage; but to have seen a Prince
Of greatness, in all grace so past report;
I nothing should repent me, and to show,
Some token of my gratitude, I have sent,
Into your treasury, the greatest Jewels,
In all my Cabinet of Beatrice.
And of my late-deceased wife, th'Infanta.
Which are two Basigus, and their Ewrs of crystal,
Never yet vallewd for their workmanship,
Nor the exceeding riches of their matter
And to your stable, (worthy duke of Byron,
I have sent in two of my fairest horses.

Sent me your horses? upon what desert?
I entertain no presents, but for merits;
Which I am far from at you^ highness hands;
As being of all men to you the most stranger,
There is as ample bounty in refusing;
As in bestowing, and with this I quit you.

Then have I lost naught but my poor good will,

Well cosine, I with all thanks, welcome that;
And the rich arguments with which you prove it,
Wishing I could, to your wish welcome you;
Draw, for your marquisate, the articles;
Agreed on in our composition,
And it is yours, but where you have porpos'd,
(In your aduices) my design for Millane,
I will have no war with the king of Spain,
Unless his hopes prove weary of our peace;
And (Princely cosine) it is far from me,
To think your wisdom, needeful of my counsel,
Yet love, oft-times must offer things vnneedeful;
And therefore I would counsel you to hold
All good terms, with his Majesty of Spain:
If any troubles should be stirred betwixt you,
I would not stir therein, but to appease them;
I have too much care of my royal word,
To break a Peace so just and consequent,
Without force of precedent iniur^e:
Endless desires are worthles of just Princes,
And only proper to the swinge of tyrants.

At al parts spoke like the most christian king,
I take my humblest leave, and pray your Highness,
To hold me a^ your servant, and poor kinsman,
Who wishes no supreamer happiness
Than to be yours: To you (right worthy Princes)
I wish for all your favors powered on me
The love of al these Ladies mutually,
And (so they please their Lords) that they may please
Themselves by all means. And be you assurde
(Most lovely Princesses) as of your lives,
You cannot be true women, if true wives.

Is this he Espernon, that you would needs
Persuade us courted so absurdly.

This is even he sir, howsoever he has studied his Parting Courtship.


In what one point seemde he so ridiculous as you would present him?


Behold me sir, I beseech you behold me, I appear to you as the great Duke of
Sauoy with these three Ladies


Well sir, we grant your resemblance.


He stole a carriage sir, from Count d'Auuergne here.


From me sir?


Excuse me sir, from you I assure you: here sir, he lies at the Lady
Antoniette, just thus, for the world, in the true posture of Count d'Auue^gne


You Are exceeding delightsome.


Why is not that wel^it came in with the organ hose.


Organ hose? a pox ant; let it pipe it self into contempt; he has stolen it
most felloniously, and it graces him like a disease


I think he stole it from D'Avuergne indeed.


Well, would he had robbed him of all his other diseases, He were then the
soundest lord in France


As I am sir, I shall stand all wethers with you.


But sir, he has praisd you above th'inuention of Rimers.


Wherein? or how?


He took upon him to describe your victories in war, and where he should
have said, you were the most absolute soldier in Christendom, (no Ass could
have mist it) he deliuerd you for as pretty a fellow of your hands, as any was
in France


Marry God dild him.


A pox on him.


Well, (to be serious) you know him well
To be a gallant Courtier: his great wit
Can turn him into any form he lists,
More fit to be avoided, then deluded.
For my Lord Duke of Byron here, well knows,
That it infecteth, where it does affect:
And where it seems to counsel, it conspires.
With him go all our faults, and from us fly,
(With all his counsel) all conspiracy.
