A Bold Induction, and, to tell you true,
'Twas fitted purposely for some of you.
And pity it is no medium men can find,
In being here perpetually unkind.
And thus with Wits and Poets runs the strife,
It Is thought may last at least this Ages life.
Or like the long disputes 'twixt France and Spain,
Besides their Allies, and the wronged Lorain:
Not all know which with better sense contest,
Though most the weaker side allow the best.
And thus they sometimes rail, and sometimes fight,
Until a juster Power compose their might.
Such a Confederate we wish for here;
And though from Nimmegen there none appear,
Yet something to comply you is designed,
A Jest you will say indeed to make you kind.
But it is no matter -- or yet stay a while,
We may have those, to spite your Wit, can smile.
Perhaps, entreated from Newmarket too,
To Sham you here, as there they others do.
Nor is it just to blame our Poet's Art,
If here, without your leave, he gets the Start.

FEllow Horsemen, let us embrace heartily. Thanks be to Heaven, we have not many
hours to spend in this Metropolitan Wilderness of Houses, called London; an
open Air fits our flesh and blood, and sports together, much better


Or to be plain, Brother, any ground of England that affords but good galloping
after Water. The Stones of Cities are more ill-natured to the Constitution and
Feet of Horses, than the Souls of the Inhabitants are to one another. Let me
never cross good Runner more, if I do any thing but dream of four-mile Plains,
shapes of Horses, and their pleasant Courses on them, this tedious night that
we have been in London


There I am with thee heartily. The very ruminating on the last sport we
happily beheld at Salisbury, Winchester, and some other places, did so fill and
quicken my drowsy thoughts with this Match, and the other Match; nay, in my
Conscience, I took my Whip in my Hand, and sometimes in my dream lashed the
Bed-post heartily, as if I had been in hard running; after which, I was so
indisposed, I know not how, this very Morning, that when the Tapster's plump
Wife came up with my mornings draught, I had scarce the heart to kiss her. But
O sweet, sweet, Newmarket! had I met with but half the temptation there, I had
rode a Heat indeed


And so thou have many a one. There are Girls that will stick at Mark to
purpose


And not give such marks too, which may be discerned in a sort of Strayers here
by the Notch in the Nose -- but let that pass


With all my heart: But cannot yet be in so much charity with this Town, as to
wish its good fortune in any thing, except its preservation from Plague and
Fire, it affords such a variety of stops to the pleasure of our Gentry

Well, God a mercy our Good King, who guides himself and them to the happy
place of Pleasure called Newmarket

I would say else (in despite of any Browantled Cockney of 'em all) that this
City might otherwise prejudice the health of the best Prince that ever Subjects
enjoyed


Right; and in detestation of which, together with all its Inconveniences, let
us cheerfully vow not to be so much of its mode as to wear Shoes whilst we
breath here


Agreed, agreed.


Fellow-Horsemen, what news?


In excellency, I hope Mr. Trainsted is already come to Town.


Not to stay, I hope?


Stay him what can, he has taken up his Lodging purposely at the Sign of the
red Lion in Holbounn, for a Nights rest or so

The very Candlelight that he employes in this place, shall be but to light
him to make Matches and Betts. His Soul and Being is too much with his Coursers
to be deluded otherwise, I warrant him


A Patron of our Sport indeed; our King has scarce a Gentleman within his
Dominions, that, next his Royal self, understands Racing so delightfully well


Nay, more, in my Conscience, he has a Horse, that shall be nameless, the sight
of whose Gaskins does more please his Eye, than if he beheld the Thighs of a
second Rosemund


And nothing of our most generous Patron Mr. Swiftspur, notwithstanding he was
expected here last night


By this time alighted certainly. I met with his Led Horse that came before him
into Drury Lane


Let me not live, if I did not expect he would rather have galloped through
this Town, than to have afforded three minutes rest here for himself or Horse


I Will warrant no stay in him, Boys.

As soon the Sun can shine in all places in England, and except
Newmarket-heath, as he not show his cheerful Spirit there


But prithee, one thing betwixt our selves; which of those two Gentlemen, next
Racing, does love a Woman best


Hum! let me see, next Racing, say thou? Why, I believe, to do 'em right,
both equally


Then, let it go so, they are Gentlemen; two such Sports I confess may be
allowed one after the other with convenience


What else, Lads? There are times of Heat and Frost, when Horses cannot
exercise, wherein their Masters, as well as we Keepers, may be humored
otherwise: Good Drink and Girls are never out of season with true Coursers;
Is It not so, Boys


Let Us away, and with this mirth find our Patroons.


Hold a tittle; are Mr. Swiftspur and his friend Trainsted come to Town?


We are just going to 'em, Gentlemen; and if you be a friend to their manner of
Communication, doubt not your welcome


I know 'em well, and have seen the sports of Salisbury, Lincoln, Brackley;
heard the discourse of Peggie Bregs, as the most famous she-creature of her
kind then extant


Very well, Sir; and to direct you better, take your way to Newmarket-heath,
where the Scene of pleasure is more gloriously laid

By the best Pegasus, it has been too much a fault in Country-gentlemen to
contrive Racing in any other place than where the King takes pleasure most: A
sign that such Squires have not civility enough to serve his recreation


Or it may be, have not suitable Confidence to attend his person so obligingly
as they wish it: but it is their way


Jock. You Will excuse us, Sir.


Here comes Trainsted -- What, in so much haste?


You must pardon me, Sir, if you were a better friend than you are; until I
have made my dispatches, met with my Associates Swiftspur and the rest, I have
not leisure for a thought


Go thy ways then, one of our gentile Horsemen, said to be pretty honest too,
and that is much in his way of dealing

What, thinking Maldrin?


Nay prithee give me leave a little.


Let me not die an honest Gentleman, if I loath any thing, next to downright
Knavery, more than a thinking friend, let the cause be almost what it will be


And must a man have no time for thought then, or suppose business?


That Is worse; Business, why it is a kind of Heteroclite, by which (especially
as the world is now) men are to be read backward, if not such sullen
Contemplators for their own advantage, that they scarce have soul to bestow a
good deed or thought on any besides themselves


Grant it true, Passal, is every man's case therefore alike? Or are there no
particular Ethics from the top to the bottom of Mankind, whereby worth might
hope for some encouragement


Does not this smell somewhat rank of reward that thou would be fain nibling
at, in order to some past merit, as is too familiar with many

By my friendship, Maldrin, I could almost leave thee with such fumes of thy
Brain, until the Vapor dissolves it self


But not to be taken notice of, after what I may call, (without ostentation)
worthy service to my Country


What, because thou wear'st a black Patch as one mark of thy honorable Scars?
Prithee go into the Market, and cry it up, and thy merit together, with thy
friends, instead of stewed Pruines, or else find some greatness to make legs to
in behalf of us both: What Is thy service, or mine, Is it not duty? Or can
thou pretend to have looked Death further in the face than I? yet when we have
done, are there not men that have served as daringly for eight pence a day, and
perhaps never had it too, yet might as highly pretend as the best of our
actions


But virtuous honesty is a handsome something.


So are knavery and foolery, well managed: either of which is many times
sufficient to outface the best Countenance in an honest man's complexion


Well, thou shall in part persuade me.


Or choose, and in thy unquoth mood join with some separate Congregation, and
pray against Plum-broth at Christmas, in expection of a Gift on their
New-years-day -- A Gentleman and not be cheerful? or that seems so burdened
with virtue, that it must necessarily bow his Soul, or spoil his Mirth? out
upon it


Prithee no more, though, to be plain, I was even going to confess that I was
even weary of being just or good much longer


To divert thee further yet, when saw thou Sir Ralph Nonsuch?


But the other night; and as formal as ever.


And rails, according to his usual manner, against Church and State; perhaps
expects so fond a providence as to be rewarded for it

Would not this make as honest a man as thou call'st thy self almost hate to
own such a handsome deed, and such an age of Pretensions as we live in


Nay, I must grant him, with thee, to be as odd a composition of Fool and
Knave, as any is now extant. A Luxuriast too in all things, I hear


And of the worst and oddest sort: to which purpose he associates sometimes
with the most illegal Sanctity, has his Nonconformist to visit him one hour, a
Dicer another, a Doctor or Musician a third: undertakes to arbitrate Love and
Faction: such a medley of man --


And keeps his Lass, or Girl too, I hear.


O yes, that in graver seasons plays at Bopeep behind the Arras, in
expectation of her Interlude with due leisure --

We'll find some opportunity to smile at his folly.

In the mean time, I Will tell thee whom I accosted just now; 'twas even that
formidable Squire Whiffler


And did he part with thee before he had new combed and set his Face?


Nor then neither, by his will. O there is not so fine a Fool extant: he thinks
the world and all things in it are not gay enough for his sake


And speaks with his Chin affectedly forward, to promote the delivery of his
words, when he would seem most pathetical to a Lady


Thou have him right; and after that manner sets one Leg odly before the other:
it is thought the Town and Court will not have done laughing at him this seven
years


Is he not proud?


to a miracle; and as ill-natured where he dares, as the love of Money and good
Clothes can make any body

He comes.


O my Messieurs, pardon my diversion a while.


Speaks he French?


So delicately, as he thinks, that he undertook lately to teach a Frenchman --
Had we but such a face betwixt us, as thou have, Whiffler


By the best tincture about me, it is complete, I hope, Gallants.


It Is odds but he paints too.


As plain as if he did it with a Trowel.


Excuse me, Sirs, I have much a better Perriwig than this, such a one that is
composed throughout of Virgin-locks, not an hour elder than fifteen: I did but
kiss the pretty Rogues, and they robbed their Heads to pleasure mine. And he
that has a better to cover with such a trifle, let him produce it if he can


You are hopeful always.


Let my Skin be polluted with the great Pox, if a grave Gentlewoman did not
protest with a good conscience, that she thought there were many Ladies would
bestow their Portions on me for one nights embrace; so that it is some question
to me whether I shall ever marry or no


A Tale of a Bawd, I dare promise for him.


But that is not all, Sirs, I have many hopes besides of being made sole Heir
to one in Fee-simple, to another in Fee-tail, with no small assurance I may
succeed a Baron of my acquaintance; as also some fine Court-words and Promises,
too many for me to remember at once


And all this for your taking Physiognomie.


Or so well built before, and behind, that no Mankind comes into my Bed at
night; you may conceive my apprehension


That Chime of thine, and the wonders thou pretend'st to, do put me in mind so
odly of the Jaw Bone of an Ass


Hang Bones, give me Beams: Is there a Woman in our way that is delicious
enough for my temptation? I protest I am scandalized with so many unrefin'd
Females as the Town abounds with


A mixture of Luxury and Folly, beyond president: see, here comes Breakbond.


Maldrin and Passal, well met, boys --

And how goes Money and fine Women in Town?


As they usually do, Tom. Some have both, and some neither; and must be
contented as well as they can


And can thou not yet take counsel of thy Friends, Breakbond?


As dully as to pay debts, thou mean.

I Will tell you, Gentlemen, I intend never to be able; and that is somewhat less
dishonesty than in many of our acquaintance -- You Will excuse my resolution,
Smock-face --


I am obliged by your expression, Sir.


Or I will owe thee, in spite of thy Teeth, Ignorance; could thou commit
such a sin against common sense, as to hope for Money of me? a thing I never
sleep with, where Wine or Women inhabit


But to be just, Breakbond, is considerable. --


I Will leave it to Divines, and Lawyers, that are paid to that purpose; however,
I find my self to be the most particular Dispensation London enjoys; the very
Women of Pleasure live on me by dozens; I maintain 'em, feast 'em, and drink up
their riot, until it tickle my spirits and theirs together. What I spend, I
borrow chiefly for that purpose: I have the happiness to be indebted to Fools
and Knaves, or such Caterpillars of the Nation as men call Usurers; perhaps
break besides with Haberdashers, Drapers, and Tailers; all venial Crimes, I Will
warrant 'em


Though thou art an odd piece of Manhood, there is so much worth in thee
besides, that I cannot tell how to chide thee heartily


Let me suffer more than I deserve, if I do not love naturally a handsome
Woman, whether she be honest or dishonest


I believe thee.


I mean generously; that is to say, I love to see Creatures of their excellence
gay and fine -- Do hear, Whiffler? -- five Guineys at thy peril immediately,
there is a Beauty of my acquaintance wants it -- Remember how lately I commended
thy handsome Face and Perriwig


Cry you mercy, Sir, you ought to command me.


Thou shall have the honor to be my Purse-bearer on such charitable accounts.

Farewell friend -- Whiffler, be sure thou do treat thy Women of pleasure
kindly, lest I have an account of thy Conversation


I warrant you, Sir.


A brave fellow, I pity him.


And no less a Gentleman, bating his extravagance. Behold Madam Quickthrift,
with her demure Lawyer


And was your last Purchase just a thousand pounds a year?


I should be sorry, Madam, if it rise not to eleven hundred, as I may raise my
Tenants


I commend thee, thrive well first, and love as I find occasion afterward --
Cry you mercy, Gentlemen


No hurt, Madam, since you vouchsafe us the beholding of your beautiful form,
and this Gentleman, your Servant


He is of the Generoso's of the Inns of Court, and near the Degree of
Barrister, (though perhaps called a Novice in some kind) by such wild ones
there, who burst out like Bucks of the first head, that men scarce hear of
their Families after 'em. He is none of that Complexion, I suppose


To serve you, Madam, is entirely my desire: And if I do not find that treated
well in what I have read, I Will burn some Volumes for your sake


A full expression: and next learn, though a Lawyer, to confer your Estate on
my discretion. Your proposal of Jointure may in some measure answer my
expectation: I care not if the world know, that my ingenuity is so beneficially
devoted, as I permit Money to be in great part my loves Idol


What you please, Lady --


But I had forgot something -- Hark you, Sir, have you not lost your
Maidenhead? Or I Will take it for granted; I know you Inns-of-Court-men lie
sometimes out of your Lodgings


An account of my Life before I am here is? --


However, I expect five hundred pounds a year more for my supposition; you will
see the Writings drawn


Indeed, Madam, -- She Is a quaint one; but no matter.


This bit of Love may puzzle a Learned Palate indeed. But the World and Women
are most unintelligible things, Passal


And ever were, and will be so.


Let me not breath if you have not a smart movement, Lady.


How know you that, Sir?


Know it, Madam? do I know my own Face?


Not so well as you ought, I believe.


She commends me already too: how I could consume my self on such a Toy! -- Let
me beg your diversion, Lady; I Will serve you with what kind of Amor you
please, besides choice Fricacies, Gellies, Potato's, Washes, Baths Nocturnal
and Diurnal, or any thing --


How now, Cock-sparrow!


I expected you would soon be weary, Madam.


You are in the right, Sir --

Mr. Maldrin, I am glad to see you -- Excuse me if I return as I was led
hither: Your Cosen Nonsuch perhaps shall judge further betwixt us


Ladies, you are well met.


Thanks, kind Passal.


Well, Madam, I could say something more, were it to much purpose.


I Am sorry to understand your Wit is so deficient.


But you know my meaning sufficiently, I suppose.


Did I ever taste your sense otherwise than by your words? What an age do we
live in, Jocalin? a Woman cannot be any thing taking, or but acquainted with as
passable a Gentleman as some one of these, but he thinks himself affronted if
he does not immediately secure her by his address


Not an eye toward me all this while, notwithstanding I have put my Face and
person in so delicate a garb


Let my virginity be not credited, if I do not love the Age exceedingly in
spite of its sin, the mirth is so great


And by my wish thou shall have it to thy desire, Jocalin. I confess thy Genius
does deserve the best alacrity of Manhood now living


Not an eye to this Cheek neither?


Maldrin, me thinks thou seem reserved, or perhaps soberly warmed by some
Amor; I will not undertake to judge. However, I dare thank you for your last
Treat, 'twas handsome


She Will not skip me for my friend, I hope.


Madam, the mirth I have to spare at some seasons, your Sex has it usually, I
confess


But is somewhat out of humor with himself and the world at present; I was
chiding him for it


We'll join with you by any means. Give me cheerfulness in flesh and blood; a
man that has always his smiles about him; one that loves pleasure dressed or
naked: such a Rider might man a Woman happily


Well, thou art mirth in abundance -- But what figure of Man is that?


One, Lady, that you may perceive by his posture, is most laborious to be taken
notice of


Me thinks 'twere sport to bestow his Image on a Signepost.


Madam, in this posture of my real self, I covet the diversion of your Glove.


An amorous term indeed!


The attendance on a Ladies Galoches might fit him well; he seems to affect
cleanness


As far as Milk and Water, with some other purifications, can extend; and if he
meets not with a Glap, it is odds but he will live as neat as Vice will allow


Out on the Creature! he is enough to spoil Loves mirth to think on him.


Here Is Maldrin knows he may be called fool safely: Besides, he thinks it no
disparagement, having been told, that men of weak brain have been sometimes
fortunate on considerable accounts


And conceives, Ladies, that if you would bestow a kiss on him, you would strangely
admire the mode of his Lip


Thou see thou art commended, Whiffler.


By my best outside, I thank you, Sir; you will remember to do it more, I hope.


Not to be thy Pimp, would thou?


No matter if she be honest, provided she be a fine one. I have such a
wheedling smack, will make her forget what Virtue means


Well, for mirth-sake I Will put thee on something.


When saw you Madam Quickthrift?


But even now, and hand in hand with her Law-student.


No wonder in her, since his Purse and Profession is so thriving: not to take
otherwise from the desert of the Gentleman -- You saw not Mr. Swiftspur


I expect him, and here he is with his friend Bowser.


Has my Mare Bonny recovered her lameness?


Perfectly, Sir, and with your own oil too.


See that my Horses go before; I Will overtake you somewhere.


I have been with my Goldsmith, and am well furnished to start hence. I thank
Heaven that I found no Rub in his Conscience at present, or politic necessity
to break, like others, who cashier their Clients expectations and Cash together

Here sum'd happily --


Thou art he I would find; if thy Purse be as plump with Goldings as mine,
give me thy hand, and set forward with me


What else, thou sportive Intrigue of delight? Alas, I was wanting thee; our
friend Bowser knows I made my delay here chiefly for thy coming. And mark me,
as very friends as we are, I am resolved to beat thy Stable through: Thou shall
not own Mare or Horse, that have not been o'rerun by mine


But in the mean time, with all this crack and our kindness together, I have
made bold to defeat some of your best runners hitherto: Not a few of thy
Goldfinches sing here: And give me but five Guineys, and I Will make it ten if I
do not better thee on our next engagement


It Is done, a Bet: you will excuse me, Ladies, if I beg the honor of your
witness


What this contains besides, shall be wager'd on Bonnyface and Thruster; I care
not much, if it be so much every mile they course


God-a-mercy for that, Trainsted -- Our application to these Ladies, and so
depart; a smile of theirs will smooth the brow of Fortune wheresoever it lights


What, going out of Town already?


As Soon as possible; the King's Hawks and Hounds are gone, the Matches made,
and ready to start in my conceit already -- You cannot do better, Gentlemen,
than to bear us company


Let Us away then, I shall do nothing else but pine with unpleasant idleness
whilst I stay here


You mentioned the Ladies even now.


'Slid, I had almost forgot 'em.


And so had I.


I am glad to hear it.


Now I better remember, I cannot but admire 'em handsomely.


Such a sight in the Stand at Newmarket as we lead over, were taking indeed.


Say you so, Sir?


Beyond measure: And to oblige you the more, you shall go what you will on the
best hand. How were a Woman to be valued that should endear our pleasures,
Trainsted


Thou have a little the start on me there, Swiftspur: but 'twas fair, I confess.


Go on the best hand, call you it? I had as lieve venture on the best Foot and
Leg


She means of one of us -- but no matter.


Let Jocalin alone, she will fit 'em, I warrant her.


And for your kindness, I conceive it as odd as the discourse of Racers when
they meet. You may take your way


O there is a movement would tempt an hot-Spur indeed! What think you of New
market-heath, Ladies? There Is a Flat would invite your Beams to play on like
Sunshine, where you may see our King exceed (if possible) his most gracious and
constant Serenity

Nothing to be found there but much mirth, pleasant things, and their business,
which some call happiness


A fine place; have you not seen it, Madam?


Not as yet.


Jocalin, thou love riding well; and next, what think thou of these
Gentlemen


Sportive, I perceive.


And of a handsome humor with it.


I could make a Quere too.


And do it home.


Is not one of these friendly Gentlemen something in your thought?


You shall soon perceive -- I hear Sir Ralph Nonsuch is indisposed.


Or sick with the warm conceit of his prudence; it is not impossible.


An Arbitrator of Love too.


I was thinking to visit him.


With all my heart.


Command my hand, Madam.


By no means, Sir.


Or mine, Lady.


Both or neither.


A paradox of love, and betwixt us two.


Remember we are friends.


Let Us accompany a while; I know thou have Betts to make; besides, I have
friends to meet will wager with us both


Then be it so, a small delay will hurt nothing -- She has fire in her Eye who
can but feel its warmth


What sai'st thou, Trainsted?


Nothing but a certain thought of a delicate Courser.


Your Usher, Ladies, I waited purposely to be so finically happy: You may
observe my divertising movement always


Along, and next to Newmarket.


There Is no being accounted wise, (with some) unless factious, I dare affirm it.


You are zealously in the right, Sir.


Whence I conceive, that to dissent on purpose to be dissatisfied, or the
spinning of trifles dexterously into as many nothings, may shame the subtlety of
Ariadne's thread


Your Worship is most Orthodoxical.


Or, as we hold, factiously pious.


Or, which is much one, tending to the vexation of Heaven and Earth, out of
private respects


The very nick of piety with us.


And had not Providence kept a close Purse, our party had often beggered this
Nation since Forty one, merely in praying for their own best advantage


You likewise pass by some frailties, as supposing the Smock be in more repute
than the Surplice; thou understand'st me, Pricknote


To a hair, Sir.


Or a certain kind of Comprehension, in spite of Superiors.


Enter me immediately a Patron, Pricknote.


Most devoutly, I assure you --


There be great ones in the world that may take notice of somebody, or men may
seem displeased, or factious until they do, I take it


Or we'll otherwise lend, borrow, trade, give peevishly on purpose.


Thou may enter it with thy Notes of Providence, Pricknote.


Nay more, Sir, I Will tediously pray for it the next cold night by my farthing
Candle


It Is judged I had no small intrigue in burning the Pope's Image on last
November


An extraordinary Dispensation, doubtless.


I must rejoice it, considering it is rumor'd, I know not how, as if that
Bishop intended to give nine months Assesment to oblige the Commons of
England, who have so long railed at him they know not why


A Sophistry that might ruin Geneva it self.


It Is meet we conceal it.


Or else preserve it, with other Annotations, on purpose to belie the
Catholics when we please


Should that Prelate affect it, it is thought there is no man in Christendom that
wears a wiser Nightcap

Nay, Luce, you are a little too open at this time.


Did not you say, Sir Knight, I should learn from your politic Converse?


But there are seasons more wise and vain together, Luce. I would not have a
scandal in the way of my concerns, Luce


With what form am I designed to be a Wench?


Even pretty Mrs. Luce; I pray permit her, there is not a soft-lipt Phanatick
amongst us but would most devoutly admire her


How pious a thing is kissing, even with these! --

I obey, Sir; but if I do not make your. Cods-head ache for this, there is no wit
in Woman


Mr. Plodwel the Lawyer, Sir --


To advise with me in point of Law, I take it: there is no living in this world
if not thought wise always


You Will remember my Exhibition, Sir?


Thy quarters Wages beforehand, for entering my Name; bid my Steward pay it.


I thank you, Sir; the smiles of Consent that you have bestowed amongst us --


I have such a complaint against your Cosen-Student here --


What is it, Lady?


Why, I am very inclinable to believe that he presumes to make his Address,
after he has been such a sinner as to lose first his Virginity


A Querie not usually insisted on, Madam; besides, it is something, I know not
how, incident to the Genius of the English, to be variable, extravagant, and
wise interchangeably; a notion of no inconsiderable policy in some


With pardon, Sir, of your grave conception, I judge it is with men as it is
with Plants: take one that blossoms too soon, 'twill starve a Sloe, or
Hedg-peake


No ebb in her humor?


To marry a Student, and not be sure of my Chambermaids when I go from home --


There are domestic cases, I confess: Nay, I have heard that Littleton himself
held Love by no certain tenure


Besides, I have not heard him say his Prayers.


Shall I try, Lady?


'Twere too much to require of my Kinsman, Madam; And Pater Nosters so much out
of fashion too


Or I Will hear him read a long Chapter to me to morrow morning: which done, he
shall speak French to me some hours afterward

I have heard that you Lawyers poison that Tongue most abominably.


A Satyrist too --

But I Will preserve my Temper.


Should a Woman espouse Love, and not well understand such a Fee-tail as this?


I once knew a man, that undertook to discern precedent copulation by feeling
of the tip of the left Ear; perhaps I might arbitrate the Question that way

Hark you, Mr. Plodwel.


So you will not feel me by the Ear --


Is there no pecuniary mulct by Law, on any of your profession, that shall be
couchant with Womenkinde before they are called to the Bar


Not as I ever heard of.


Then whisper her in the Ear, and tell her, it is my sense that all is well --
Madam Clevly, with others

Perhaps some amorous emergencie to be determined by me --

I Will attend their leisure.


Where left you Maldrin, Sir?


I suppose withdrawn upon some concerns. --


Or melancholy perhaps, I guess the cause.


Indeed, Lady.


His presence was ill omitted.


I understand you not, Madam.


You may perhaps, or there are Almanack-makers to enquire of. --

How is it, Jocalin? thou art cheerful still.


So far, that no Dido of our Sex shall teach me to whine for any Catastrophe
that Cupid can bestow


But we forget Madam Quickthrift, with her Servant.


A studious Beetle-brow'd-hing, Ladies, that cannot conster my Amor in order
to Money, Manners, and Wit


I am sorry for his sake.


You shall not, Lady.


Fie on these Riddles of Loves making: Give me a passion as gay as Gossamors,
that when I am indisposed, my Love may raise my Comedy, and take me that way
too


Ladies, you are welcome -- If you have any thing of Love to decide, command
Sir Ralph Nonsuch


A mere question betwixt this Gentleman and my self; but ended already, I know
not how


I must not think so.


Ladies, you may command my house:

Of all vanities, I most dispense with the softest.


And have your Amor, I guess too, preserving the respects of your
State-faction


Or a politic capacity bestowed on Venus: is it not so, Sir Ralph?


I confess, Lady, that there may be (formally taken) a juggling of Interest and
Pleasure together in some, whereby they may seem a deceptio visus to the
Public; a very ordinary Stateintrigue, I take it


No more of your kissing policy, Knight, or annex it to your discussions
somewhere


Me thinks we are not brisk enough, or some body's wanting. -- What say you,
Quickthrift


So merry, Madam, that for your recreation you shall see my Lawyer manage his
great Horse


That were pleasant.


By no means, Lady; 'twill shame some of the Judges, who can scarce walk their
Steeds handsomely to Westminster


Not he come yet? it allays my mirth a little.


These Ladies are too fine, notwithstanding thy Complexion, Whiffler.


'Twere a disparagement to my Physiognomy to think so.


For five pound more, I Will commend thy face to a handsome Wench, and that is
enough for thee


It Is impossible, Sir.


I Will make her so, to any man that loves kindly: and now stand at some
distance, Whiffler, and covertly too, till I have done


If I must not show my face, I must not, and that is some unkindness.


Ladies, I am yours; Knight and Lawyer, I salute you: But Knight, take a care
of too particular and clandestine frailty, it is enough to ruin a Republic of
Females


Are you my Instructor, Sir?


Yes, or any man's that understands not how to admire woman handsomely, or in
that abundance that nature delights. Shall a Pagan worship a whole Firmament of
Stars at once, and a man generously principled not far more devote himself to
every luster in Womankinde


A Libertine indeed -- You want no money, Sir?


Yes, to spend, or give it.


To some of our Sex, I suppose.


I confess, Madam, they have the first of my commiserations in all kinds: If I
find a man uses his Wife scurvily, or beats her, I beat him as well as I can
for it: If a Wench be used too coursly by her Friend, I give him a cut with my
Sword for her sake. There Is more conscience in enjoying Woman always, than in
payment of Debts, or let me not be called Breakbond


I did not expect so handsome a Raillerie.


An obligation to all our Sex at once.


There Is none that writes She, but may in part command him.


But has little to say for old Women, I conceive?


But I have, Lady; if they do but Mump upon me kindly, I could find in my
heart to Kiss 'em heartily

At least, I wish most devoutly that Nature could afford some restorative to
render such young and gay ten times over


Why this is generous indeed!


I knew he would make it out.


Passal, I am thy friend -- And once more, Knight, take a care of too formal or
single vanity; every Gentleman that can drink handsomely may instruct thee
better


An irruption I expected not.


You Will remember your promise, Sir?


I do, and mark these Doors.


Shall I not show my rosy Cheeks to the Ladies first?


By no means, thou see 'em busy.


Have I discerned her?

Thou pretty rogue of Venery.


So open again, Luce?


I am gone, Sir.


Have found my Cheek again, thou pretty Bo-peep thou?


Dispatch, I beseech you.


Hark thee: about half an hour hence --


Enough, I Will not fail you.


I find I am now secured.


I have succeeded most propitiously, Sir.


Away then.


No matter, Sir Ralph, though his mirth be bold, it is passable.


There shall nothing live that has so much of Woman as can make out
Hermophrodite, that I could not oblige cheerfully: And hark you, Lawyer, thy
looks speak thee civil


I should hate my face else.


Let me oblige thee to take no Fee of Woman-client that is handsome, or
amorous, for my sake: If thou do, may Rats consume thy Writings


You are a kind Sir.


If at any time thou suest me, do what thou can I Will never pay thee.


Threaten the Law?


When my Grandmother dies, I Will make thee my Trustee to pay my Obligations to
Women: For Men, I have used 'em to good words, and they expect no more;
wherefore, love Females in the first place, follow thy Vocation in the next;
and whenthou come to be a Judge, remember thou were frankly advised by Tom
Breakbond


You have, Sir.


And one thing more -- Thou shall join in a Petition with me, That all Women
not superannuated, and such as have not more Money than Kindness, may be
discharged of their debts; that they may be troubled with no other Obligation
than their love to men


And may I not add in thy behalf, That such of that Sex as are indispensably
old, yet, in their precedent time, have been celebrated by humane affection,
should likewise have their release, according to this invention of thine


I embrace it heartily: the youthful part of my memory might otherwise have
ingratefully forgot it


And what shall such do that are able to pay, and will not?


Provided they love much, let 'em disburse little; or only now and then to a
Tire-woman, or Chambermaid, things assistant to their Business, Complexion,
and Feature


Suppose one woman be indebted to another, what would you then determine?


Well urged In Faith, Student, thou't go near to pose him there.


Let me see -- I have it, and handsomely too: Why, in that case, let her that
is fairest and most beloved of men, in commiseration forgive the other


An arbitrament of Love, you will end it Knight?


It Is what he desires.


Why, look you, Ladies and Gentlemen, there may be a vanity in all
Comprehensions; as he that eats one poach'd egg, may possibly long for more;
there are several incitements, I take it; you will excuse me a space --


A Nonsuch indeed!

What are these?


Men that are so unhappy, as to have almost lost our selves.


Or what is worse, our best Companions and Patroons: if ever you had compassion
of men expert in the use of Whip and Spur, assist our condition


You want no charity, do you?


Not so much as the abundance of Love which we apprehend here: There were more
of us in number, besides two of the best gentile Jockies that ever England
bred. They must be ensnared with the pleasures of the Tavern, Gaming-houses, or
worse places: There Is nothing but Ginns and Gilts here, or a sort of Town-sluts
that will out-lie Horsecoursers


And Jockies together, it may be: That Providence should dispense so useful a
creature as a Horse, and yet permit man to tell so many abominable falsehoods in
respect of its use! What say thou, Breakbond


They wrong not Women, I hope?


No, by my troth, they have done a many too much right.


O! I remember 'em, Servants to our friends and good fellows:

I dare pass my word for 'em, they will cozen any other way, rather than ride
booty


That Is no usual commendation in their profession.


For which, I Will not presume to displease your Worship so far, as to put you in
mind of ten shillings yet unpaid me ever since the last Race at Bansted


Thou may freely: I suppose I gave thee good words for thy own, did I not?


As any Gentleman living, that pays money no other way.


Nay, thou't forget our design.


I warrant thee -- Might I beg a short favor at your hands, Mr. Breakbond?


Speak it.


We conceive you have some interest with Ladies in this Town.


And ever shall, I hope: but what is thy desire?


To request you, Sir, that by any means you would hinder our Chiefs, Mr.
Swiftspur and Mr. Trainsted from Coping with any such delights; if they do,
they will set down their Runners, and turn us off immediately


Here Is a Lady or two in our eye, I think may deserve our apprehension.


Now I perceive you are Knaves indeed in blue Caps: I dissuade Love? --


Good Sir, have patience: Or were it not all one if any of 'em had a fair Match
for their Maidenheads at Newmarket

There would be no sport hindered that way.


The very conceit has reconciled me, Lads; I only want some Crowns to express
it: perhaps the Stars above may decree something


In the mean time could we see these Commanders of ours?


I expect 'em each minute, let that comfort you -- Your excuse, Ladies, and the
rest


More of the men of Newmarket, or you would attend your Masters here.


With leave, Lady.


As sure as Heaven smiles on your faces, this day must end with mirth that will
please every where


I hope we shall find room for it.


Maldrin, we wanted thee here: Sir Ralph Nonsuch has made such amorous
decisions, that Jocalin, Quickthrift, and my self, have smiled most abominably
at it

I am sorry thou did not share mirth with us.


You have obliged mine already, Madam -- How far'st, Breakbond?


As well as Woman can make me.


Thou art happy then.


And will be, that way, in spite of Destiny.


But your friend Passal and I wanted you here.


Excuse me, Lady.


I cannot, Maldrin and you join hands.


It Is strange, but it is her will, Passal.


I obey it.


How like you one another Faces now?


Have never a Baby in thy eye extraordinary, Maldrin? or do see one in mine?


I know not.


No matter, I Will not trouble Sir Ralph Nonsuch to determine this affair,
another time may do it


She has amazed us both.


Now they are come; a little of your patience, Lady.


Thou art such another man of expedition, that there is no kind reason that
accompanies thy diligence, notwithstanding our engagements to the Ladies here:
Bowser could almost chide thee with me


Rather let me commend thee, Trainsted; thou love Sports with thy whole soul,
may Heaven delight thee for it: what are such She-objects, to a man that can
with more gayness behold his brown Mares Buttocks, than the finest of their
Concealments


Thou say right, Bowser; besides, having been almost dazzl'd with such a
taking temptation, there is no reason to hazard it again

See who waits our remove.


With such a desire to be jogging, that if we stay here this night, it shall be
with so much spite to our ease, that we'll sleep in our Boots


And what is worse, the best spirit of Liquor in Town has no power on our
mirth; I know not whether or no we may be too melancholy to wench, if you
continue thus


God-a-mercy Will and Tom; come, we'll soon to horse; I Will not desert any of
our society


What if thou go before, Trainsted?


Did thou not tell me of my engagement, and being civil, just now?

In what haste art thou altered! -- See who moves toward us, I cannot withdraw
rudely from such an Object; Madam, the obligement of your hand before our
departure


To save you that trouble, I Will take leave first:

Here are other Ladies that may deserve your civilities.


By no means, Madam; thy rash demeanor reflects too much on us both.


Rather than so, Lady, I Will spend my Spring and October here, though it take
from my usual converse in other places


A kind compliance, I confess.


Nothing at all, Madam, to what I dare assure you: besides, this friend of mine
may have a more particular occasion

The truth is, he feeds and sets his Runners much by his own care, it is well
known to Bowser and my self: for which reason you may dispense if you please


How! I abhor this Placket-wheedling: Let me not live, Lady, if it be truth
well intended; rather dispatch somebody else if you think fit. Trainsted, if
thou let'st this Go-by pass, may thou never more win Match


I have considered; by your favor, Mr. Trainsted, a word with you, Sir.


Your pleasure, Madam?


I suppose you have your Purse of Gold about you?


At your service, if it contained Millions.


You dare trust me with it?


Trust you, Madam! a mere favor that you will receive it; I have credit enough,
I hope, to discharge my Wagers otherwise, if it must be so


You Will find me faithful.


You have given me assurance.


You Will not remove now, and tell your friends, in case your ready money fail, I
keep your stakes


A Sweep-stakes indeed!


A mere neglect of thee, I knew 'twould come to this; that so ready a Brain as
thine could not perceive it


I may perhaps conster it otherwise: Women have many wiles, or I find her too
handsome to chide with: 'twas five hundred Guineys, and should I forfeit for
want of depositing, with some ill natured Betters? but no matter -- Your
Servant, Lady


You Will not be gone to night?


If possible; what shall I do? the very cast of her Eye will detain me in spite
of my beloved Racing: At present I Will remove however -- Come along, Horsemen,
you will find my spleen move cheerfully in spite of fate


I Will follow him.


Not yet, Bowser, we'll rather overtake him on the Road.


I have enough of this sort of Game, I thank you.


Let me persuade thee; I know there are some here may take it amiss.


I am all Air, and could leap upwards to think how I have laid my design.


What, surpised, Jocalin?


A movement I remembered of my last dance.


Ladies, I beg your pardon, I withdrew a little with this Gentleman, and have
showed him such a Jennet of mine the best of your Sex might borrow Thighs on,
it is such a Let-down creature


Your Horse is much beholden to you.


Not so, Lady; he that loves his Horse generously, will love Woman in abundance
-- Is It not so, Bowser


A free humor.


Let Us proceed to our Field-sports first, stretch our Limbs well as the Morning
breaks, and the Hounds run heartily: for Woman, let flesh and blood find her
as occasion serves: There Is such delays in this Town, they sicken Recreation


A Huntsman to purpose.


But to do what thou know on with one of these, Bowser, were more than a
chase with Diana and her Hounds together


What lusty things these men of pleasure are!


They have sure amused my Lawyer.


I intend to make no such Bencher, Lady.


I am once more thine, Passal, with thy friends -- I had almost forgot thee,
Breakbond; if thou come to our next Race, borrow money there if thou can


Or I Will out-bet you all there; it is in my power to stake a fair one at every
Miles end, win her who can


A wager above all; thou shall ride my best Galloper to bid thee welcome.


This is mirth indeed, Jocalin.


I hope so -- What say you, Sir Ralph?


Why, it is to be understood, Ladies, that if pleasure be duly appropriated, it
may conduce something


Or a politic capacity for a Girl in private; is it not so, Knight?


You have touched too near the Quick there.


Is there no Music here?


My house affords it, Lady; I permit a sober affectation of pleasures in all
kinds


And now and then a Pricknote besides, if I mistake not.


I Will join my steps here.


Such a measure as had turns and doubles like a hunted Hare I should like
heartily


You Will excuse me, Ladies; though I be full of pleasure in conceits, my great
Toe is somewhat indisposed


Or in your Milk-diet perhaps, as it is usual with some heavy Politicians to
refresh that way


Start apace, Music --


Me thought Mr. Plodwel moved towardly.


I confess, with somewhat more grace than the Grave of the Inns of Court move
round their Fire at Christmas


Who leads, Gentlemen?


My hand to serve you.


Or mine.


Both, if you please.


More Riddles yet!


Away with this Ceremony, a thing in women I least forgive.


Then I Will conduct you.


So confident of the sudden!


Do not I tread tolerably? -- Your judgment, Ladies?


God-a-mercy Lawyer, I begin to love thee.


Me thinks I quicken strangely; shall we have the other dance?


Is It possible?


In my Conscience he is a good Horseman too; and that is much for a Student.


Enough at this time -- Our thanks, Knight.


By your leave, Ladies.


WHere left you Passal?


I know not well, Lady.


Your Address is not so welcome then.


Call it my fault, Madam.


That Is something handsome, I confess, a single and solitary Courtship; why
every Chambermaid has it on most Holydays: I must not think on it


That I should mingle Love with my other concerns.


Not that I Would have you fall below your merit; I know you have been a Soldier,
and deserve a handsome recompense, though men of your Complexion are not always
fortunate to find it, as some may read your Stars


Your smiles may make them more propitious, with pardon, Madam.


How is it, Lady? -- Me thinks thou art not cheerful, friend.


Never better, I know not well for what cause.


Why then, it is as it should be, is it not, Frank?


I hope so.


Or I have an Intrigue shall oblige you both.


Again reverting?


The very same -- There Is no such odness in you both, or either, but I may
admit your Rivaldry


She has thrown me back again.


A thing very familiar with Ladies that have but two Servants -- Or suppose I
think a way to increase the merit of one in the worth of both, would this pose
you


Next to the Gat with nine Lives, a double soul'd Woman! you have two Hands,
two Feet, no other Member of Love that must be doubly supplied


So you will join Honor to it, our Senses cannot differ much.


Speak it, Lady.


Take it in a word then: It Is which of you two shall impose the most worthy
action on me


To be commanded by us!


Most obediently: There Is nothing more common than for Women to command Men;
every small Address has it: wherefore I Will invert it to oblige more fully


A Paradox I have not met with.


You have time to study it.


To impose on her, it is an odd Devoir, and yet me thinks looks generous.


Abating that expression, I should have sworn that thou and I should have come
the Caster with her by turns


She Is fair, and no less worthy.


But how to pleasure such fair and worthy Flesh and Blood, and not the direct
way of Nature, is such a Mizmaze to Manhood --


It Is certain she loves one of us.


And could we not rather wish she was enamored of us both, unless either of us
understood her better

To deliver such Problems of Love as make Sense itch to resolve em, and yet
cannot, 'twas not so kind in her Ladyship, I conceive


I cannot help it.


Suppose one of us bid her adieu; were it not as well? prithee tell me; thou
know I love thee


I grant it; but In Faith I cannot do so much for your sake.


Would thou could then.

Or no matter, we are friends, and we'll love together, and heartily.


Let Us walk and think.


As cheerfully as possible.


Thy Hand to assure me.


No eye near us?


None but mine, and that does make such a pretty Infant in thine. Prithee try
whether thou can see it and our selves together in my Looking-glass

BY the Lilies of thy Cheeks, and the Roses of mine,
By every soft dimple,
And every pretty twinkle
That conveys my Beauty to thine;
Let me decoy thee as my Duck,
And next teach thee to give suck,
Or my face I behold wants luck.
See how my wanton-eye-babes invite thee:
Or what tickles above measure,
Take me sprucely together,
My fineness I Will yield to delight thee.
And should thou clip more refine
Than French or English when they twine,
My Delicass thou't prove sublime.

But I have to do with such a cautious sinner, and one that studies to make me
wise


Hang him, course Looby, he has no countenance in his face that intimates the
agility of a neat Wencher

Thou shall know me in part by this extraordinary kiss.


You take me to be a Wench, I perceive -- But were you not a handsome Man, and
one that has money --


Here Is this Ring, I have half the Exchange in my head besides for thee.


God Lord! and what a fine man are you?


Anon I Will make thy Limbs so supple in my Bath, thou can not imagine: It
shall be of white Bread and Milk, or Curds and Cream, take which thou like


But see, you must needs withdraw, Sir -- Here Is one of Sir Ralph Nonsuch his
Rabbet-catchers: There Is scarce a Ferret sees further into a Coney-hole


Thou know where to meet; I am gone, Luce.


Hold a little, your Purse of Guineys first.

Away now.

Who would not trust Heaven somewhat to cozen Fools and Knaves?


Mrs. Luce here, I should not have thought it. Most happily met, sweet Mrs.
Luce


Thanks, kind Pricknote.


I could say something more, gentle Mrs. Luce, --


Sir Ralph Nonsuch his Intelligencer, but no matter.


Thou art fair indeed, Mrs. Luce; I could almost compose a Canticle, and
dedicate it to thee; so much the breath of my mouth does warm my words


Ha, ha, ha! an amor of his toward too!


Or, thou art more than my Rebecca unto me Isaac.


A married Publican, it seems!


Thy Knight is most candid, I confess; no craneys of suspicion to be found on
his Brow; thou may conceive me


And conceive by thee, in a Temporal sense: Is It not so, Sneak-face?


Surely I might do much for your sake.


Or get a scurvy Christian suitable to the method of your own baptizing: well,
you are a Pricknote indeed; and should Sir Ralph know it --


Good honey Mrs.


And what a complete Sister of your Brotherhood you might enter me in your
Note-book


For my Exhibition-sake spare me, together with my Wife and six Children, that
most devoutly pray for it


Well, I Will excuse you for once, so you tell my tale to the Knight, and your
own effectually: I know you Phanaticks can lie of course


More than kind Mrs. I thank you.


What a world of Love and Zeal is this? --


I confess, Cosen Plodwel, that your deportment is acceptable enough; but you
may yet want instruction: for, look you, Sir, it is a certain dexterity of the
Age we live in, to be serious and vain together, I can testify it


Indeed, Sir Kinsman!


Take it in pleasure and interest, what is it but a complicating together of so
many nothings with as many somethings


And you have proved it, Knight?


I may perhaps, and hopefully too: But to come nearer your purpose, I find the
Lady of your Address has some scruples slip from her I know not how: She Is
beautiful, and that implies a handsome something; or at worst, joined to a more
tolerable insignificacy, the very pleasure that some may take, even of our Sex,
so they be held improper and useful together, either to Church or State


The Politics of a Nothing indeed!


It Is true, she hinted something of Money and Prayers, but I would not have you
start at her devotion therefore. Perhaps she may be of all, or of no Religion,
as is common with some beautiful and parsimonious Ladies: There Is an excess, or
intricate delight, in some sense allowable to most Complexions


But I honor Government and Law, remember that, Sir.


So do most, provided they get by either; whence I conceive proceeds the very
sober vanity of the Factious: There Is no courting Mankind to be honest, now a
days, without their particular emoluments; your Law cannot do it otherwise


The greater shame to the perverse Genius of our Nation. Can there be a more
high inducement than to be legally good, or to submit to the divine perfection
of Reason formed into Law? Believe me, Sir, it shall guide my civil being. Nay,
from it too I Will own my Love, I Will bed no such irregularity in Nature that does
not grant it is due humanity with mine, and thence deduce my future happiness


But thou art so inclined to mistake, Plodwel! I told thee there would be ever
delicious Intrigues both legal and illegal, or not improperly mixed, if
formally apprehended


A F^^ of some gravity.


Mrs. Luce, Sir --


How, Pricknote!


Was going, or might have gone.


Gone, say thou?


Even perhaps astray, had she not returned with me.


I Will double thy Exhibition for that, immediately, Pricknote --

Nay, Luce, the same misdemeanour again, Luce?


Have I found you, Knight?


Is not this Company serious enough, Sir? But I can submit.


I know thou can.


You Will not forget my Velvet-gown.


It Is bespoke already -- A way, and see dinner be provided.

I come immediately.

Pricknote, thou shall eat with us, I know thou art often hungry.


I thank you, Sir.


A friend of mine that had some serious business with me.


Some of your serious vanity, I suppose.


You Will excuse my dispatch.


A sudden affair doubtless -- But enough of your counsel, Knight. --

She Is here.


Me thinks he alters something -- You have heard I am proud, Sir.


And covetous too; but as you please.


Grant me both, or such a Lady that values her profit by her pleasure. One that
knows how to bestow four of your best Terms on a Gown or Coach; or when the
Town affords a choice Gem, or Necklace, send you and your Clerk immediately to
buy it for my use: It Is enough if your Estate and Vocation, with my own best
frugality, be subservient to an ingenious expense; a thing not so frequent with
very deep Penmen


You may be observed in all -- As I conceive, Madam.


Or should it sour the Complexion of a new-fledg'd Advocate, that perhaps
scarce knows how to wear the Wings of his Gown neatly on his shoulders -- Am I
not right, Sir


Most exceedingly -- That an honorable Profession should be thought to
derogate from the esteem of a Gentleman -- But I am prepared


And be so, I suppose your Scribe has drawn the Writings.


He Is something slow, I confess, Lady.


No matter, there are men in the world that have as good Feet and Legs as most
of your sedentary Complexion


Take who you please, or can.


Indeed Sir, and thus Cockt, and Capt too!


I own no movement but what suits a Gentleman: Nay more, I Will throw off all
besides to make me yours, or any other you shall judge most worthy of your
choice: and this perhaps your own way too


Why, now you rise indeed! proceed.


It Is warmly in my Brain -- You Will give me leave to take my Study for a while?


There Is more than I expected in him.


Mr. Plodwel gone already?


In some haste, I know not well the cause.


You are not too severe, I hope?


When I know his deserts better, your Ladyship may have an account. In mean
time me thinks there is more than one Genius meet in him


That is to say, the Lawyer and the Gentleman, if I take him right; a brisker
motive to your Love, Madam, since these Complexions are not always united


I must think better -- Your excuse, Lady.


I Will withdraw with you.


And are we met once more here? Let Us clap our Whips for joy:

Or what if we lashed our selves a little, for losing one another I know not
how


Well thought on, Jack; I care not much if we begin with thy Back, Rowland: we
missed thee about Whetstone's-park. It Is odds but thou did slip into a
faulty corner there. But no matter, anon the Jug shall go round on Horseback,
and so excuse our neglects


If I back my Galloper again, I Will give him an extraordinary lash for the Oats
he has so lazily devoured in this Cockneydominion


I commend thee, Tom; and for my Steed, he begins to look sowrely on me in the
Stable; I apprehend he has a growing Head, I find it already in that lubberly
slave the Hostler, who takes no more care of him than a Jailer does of his
Prisoner -- There will be money wanted amongst us, I suppose


But we have a Swiftspur and Trainsted that will discharge all: One or other of
them never yet failed us to go on the best runner; or what is better, so much
to nothing unless they were winners


Well remembered, Fellow-horsemen; and so in case of the worst, we'll pay 'em
again out of their own winnings


Nothing better: well, this Racing is a most noble sort of Recreation, since it
undoes Gentlemen to raise Grooms, blessing on their Hearts for it


Here comes Bowser, one of sportive expedition indeed.

And how go matters, Sir?


Not so cheerfully as I could wish, Tom. I blush to think what a Truant I have
been to Time; besides, my Purse begins to be thin, and indisposed too


If I did not bode it, hang me.


And at such a time too, when our Horses and we are like to pinch for want of
due Provender


There Is no subsisting for a kind Complexion here; what between expense,
lending, with such other gratuities to wanting Gentlemen, that, like the best
sort of Beggars, provide for their idle poverties, chiefly here, a man is
worried with such a restless charity


I hope you say not this by way of prevention, Mr. Bowser?


Not I, believe me. And for our other friends, if their Guineys do not make a
loose on the Bones of four Dice, or sink into some Wenches Pocket, according to
the adventures of Towngallants, there may be hopes of moving yet


Otherwise, may a She-devil accompany all the Animals. I care not if I do not
love my Chessnut-mare so well as I have done, for the same reason


Here comes one of those we wanted; she with him too! it is something ominous,
but no matter


I did not think the Town could have contained you to this minute; but you
found cause, it seems


I were more than far unworthy, should I neglect the least of your smiles.


Trainsted already with her?

There Is no trust to the blood of Jockeys.


And take this more: the confidence you did so willingly repose in me, does
oblige my thoughts in some near degree to serve you


I like not this.


Swift spur, come.


By my life, I could chide thee, a man of thy speed, and not going yet; I meant
to call thee


A word, Mr. Trainsted, do not leave the Town until thou have first wearied him
out on it; thou may have reason; besides, there is no way to spite him like it,
on all our accounts


I thank thee -- And do thou not perceive who may take horse first now,
Swiftspur? where is the Brains you talked on


I am a Calves-head if I could not find in my heart with some disdain to be
gone instantly, and be it so -- farewell, Madam


Hold a little, Sir. What if I bet with a Lady in your behalf?


Nay then I am with thee again: she comes about, Trainsted, just taking of my
Nag's part against thine


But most convenient to make Stakes out of your Purse, I suppose it is about you.


Nothing more ready at your service, Madam; she has thine already too; a mere
device of hers to hold thee in Town to bear me company; I knew it all along


Behold me, Men of Metal; do not these ring handsomely, Yours, and yours, and
yours, and yours, Sirs? there is no broad Gold in either, is there


About sixscore Two-and-twenties in mine, Madam.


Very good, I know of a Diamond-ring may fit me about that price -- Or, now I
consider better, take your Purses again: and if you think fit, remove together;
I perceive you love one another's society


I cannot, will not leave thee.


If I might, I would not.


Then welcome both: and who shall direct the setting of the Runners now,
Gentlemen


It gives me some melancholy to think on it.


Well enough, I Will warrant thee; here are these we'll send before us to take
care


Or let us venture a while longer, it is but giving 'em some Crowns to drink,
and stay for us


Best of all, here is money amongst you, Horsemen; at your Lodgings you will find
Meat and Wine, besides -- Nay, no repining


I should not, were it not for that kind lovely Bess of mine I left at the
Star at Newmarket; I cannot choose but let fall a warm tear to think how I want
her


And he that refuses this Lady's health, shall bestride no Courser of mine.


Agreed, agreed.


Away, and whilst his money lasts, at worst we'll be merry.


Or I Will drink and weep together.


Madam, you have not yet vouchsafed the favor of your hand.


Or what think, if thou and I draw Guts for it, Swiftspur? I dare wager with
thee that way too


You shall excuse me, Sir; unless I judge which of you may best deserve the
longest trifle. See who comes here


These Mounters are the men, it seems, Jocalin: But take a care you love not
Riding the better for em


Look to your own Intrigue, Lady; if I cannot so far weary Flesh and Blood, the
good nature of Love is the more obliged by me


Our friend Breakbond!


And resolved to be entered a Horseman for your sakes, and yours, Ladies.


But not to jade us, I suppose?


Let me have Sports, Women, and Money, and let the World turn round, 'twill
serve my System well enough


How I could hugg thy friendship! What say thou, Bowser?


This Town, this wearisom Town, there is no Game starts here, but what is under a
Petticoat


God-a-mercy, Huntsman!


Lady, my respects are yours,


I suppose it, Sir; but here is Mr. Breakbond has such an universal affection to
our Sex


And will, Ladies, so long as I can either give or borrow.


And buy Love that way, after the manner of some Gallanteries.


Seldom or never, Madam; where I affect, I find Women in abundance that will
bestow that toy on me: a Gentleman may go less on trust for Love than Apples,
if he please


But you have friends, I judge, that share with you in such Intrigues sometimes.


And welcome too, so they borrow what I am willing to lend, not otherwise.


An odd humor!


And yet, me thinks, pleasant.


Or, where I cannot oblige handsomely to my humor, I give my friend leave to
do it for my sake and his own together


A borrowing and giving of Love indeed!


A more eternal thing, Ladies, than Generation and Corruption, if I mistake not.


Enough to make us smile and blush together.


You want no Money, Sir?


No, 'faith, Lady, I have just enough to give at this time, I thank Providence.


Let me not live, if thy company be not worth half Newmarket.


That so sacred a place of Recreation should be so profaned! Had I but so much
as my Horn here, to quicken this dull time a little, 'twere somewhat toward
sport


And if thou had, thou should blow up a Jubilee to Love and Mirth at once,
Rogue


Still love in your way.


So much in haste, that a man cannot duly laugh, and sport with his friends,
were too much a fault. Besides, we have made an appointment to match and
frolic, where thou shall hear Trainsted talk so cunningly odd, that he will
catch Betters before they gather his meaning or their own


A man would think that Jockeys were begotten in haste, yet act with so many
dilatory circumstances: well, give me the merry Huntsman that sports apace
daily


Have found the place?


I have; and can direct you, Madam.


Enough, be gone --

Touch and take, start and away, God-a-mercy Tick-tack.


And the Tick-tack-Mare too, next Woman-kinde there was not such a She-creature
-- swiftspur, I find my spleen does palliate something


I knew thou would have patience for my sake. More of our Friends!


Who shall give off thinking first now, Passal? art not weary yet?


No 'faith: and yet I love it as little as possible.


Or do not perceive she is above what Sense can reach?


She Is no Woman, if she be, do what her wit can do --


O Friends, we mist your mirth; here is Breakbond, and Break-jest too in
abundance


Passal, and Maldrin, your Hands; and next, be frolic; it is Woman that expects
it


Excuse us a little.


I knew you would pose your Servants.


Is this an age to be provoked with Love's Riddles?


Not I, believe me; and for Maldrin, you know his public merit may a little
stick on his spirit; he has been a Soldier, is it not so, Sir


But had never such an onset to make in the field of Cupid before, I thank my
Stars. My Friend and I, Lady, have considered


Very good.


But to impose on a Lady, or to oblige her to bed with one of us two Men, were
such a crime --


Is this what I expected, Passal? What say you, Maldrin?


I know not, except you please to think for me.


Dull things, that cannot command a Woman to merit takingly! you will think
again, I suppose


Think, Lady? perhaps one or both of us may dream at night; what say thou,
friend


A dozen to one on it.


Then dream instead of thinking; there may be worth in that.


But how to convey it warm enough to your Ladyship, that is another Querie.


When your thoughts are more mature, you may acquaint me.


That Love should impose so unhappily on my humor, as thinking amounts to.


And could reproach me for it? but it is no matter.


Jocalin, your hand; it is time we walk.


By that cast of her eye, she could have taken mine as willingly. Bowser,
there is sport behind, I Will warrant thee


If my Limbs tarnish not in the mean time with keeping London-company.


At night we'll drink, perhaps have a Covey at the Dog and Partridge.


Or tame Coneys in couples, according to the Townmode.


Come, Horsemen, you know our haste.


Since it is thus, give me thy hand, Passal; we must needs think again, it seems.


That word Thinking -- Well, I Will bear thee company.


ARe not we mounted in conceit, Kester?


What else, Rowland? and these the beloved Figures of the most noble Coursers
of the last age


For which reason, I conceive it no small happiness, though but in imagination,
to bestride 'em thus


Nothing better; I itch all over to be at any thing like Whip and Spur.


Now, suppose our selves running on the four-mile Heath.


Then I suppose my Roan is holden on thee the first mile.


Have at thee on the second going up Choak-jade, or at the Ditch: Whiterose was
a whole Runner there


No more of the Devil's-ditch, prithee; I had a Cup in my Pate last night, and
dreamed I was near it in earnest. But have at thee for the Flat; I am sure I
must have overstroken thee there, and so throughout --

They come; let us sit thus, and surprise 'em.


A pox on this indigested London-liquor, its best essence is fit for nothing
but to beget a crude sort of Females, that are so impudent to turn up their
Crescents by Moonlight


And for its unsodden fulsome Ale, it is only useful to thicken the Wastes of
Tailers to the use of their Wives: though the Villains sit frequently
cross-legg'd, they commonly espouse greater Pagans than themselves


I fear by my Compass I am plump'd above weight; and what a misfortune were
that to a well-reputed Jockey? Were it amiss, friends, to think of a She-waster


And so put the Pox in the Scales with thee, it is better to ride over-balanc'd
somewhere -- Well, Kester and Rowland are precious Knaves to be wanting, and
our Chiefs just coming hither


See, here they are, and, if my eyes dazzle not, mounted too!


To your wonder, fellow-horsemen: behold the figure of most inestimable
White-rose


And this of matchless Roan-dutton!

We have rode a four-mile Course with 'em in conceit too.

The next thing we do, shall be to present 'em to our Patroons.


But I Will have Swiftspur to have both, by your leave.


How, both?


Yes, both, or I Will scourge thee into better manners.


Indeed, Sir --


Hold, fools, I Will give you reason: Mr. Swiftspur is a man of Estate, at
present has a Country-hall, he will judge adorned with their remembrance, and
think 'em his best Monuments

For Trainsted, he is a Sojourner with his Horses, and putting aside his good
fortune, Master of little as yet


Content, content; we can be but well requited, let us join hands on it.


See, you are presented, Sir.


I know their fame, and have not seen better figures of these excellent
Runners; you shall receive my full thanks: Such shapely Lineaments, as might
shame the Trophy of Bucephalus


And that Macedonian Greatness it is Erector.


To say truth, he had been a pleasant Gentleman, had he understood a running
Horse as well as Wine and Women


It may be some such lubberly Steed as the French Monsieur usually manages. I
conceive him to have been at most but a good Trotter


Come, sit, give me the List, Trainsted.

Let me see twenty two Matches immediately ensuing.


May they prove lucky: I have been half undone with laying the odds last
meeting


For my part, I intend to bet freely; you know my way, friends.


Would we were on the place first.


Thou art so earnest still to follow Yopers, that make so much haste to devour
a simple Hare. Remember to be more sparing of the King's Game, lest his
pleasure want it: Speak your opinions, Horsemen


My opinion is, that Bay-lusty may have a good match on it.


But, I must not forget how Tick-tack handled him. I never saw a better Loose
run up Choak-jade


There I am with thee, Swiftspur; and for Have-at-all, he is a hearty runner,
doubtless


But the misfortune of the Scotch Horse!


Curse light on him, he has lost me Money, when I thought I was more than sure
on it


To stumble on a black Coat, was such a fate for that Horse! --


A Book-man that rode with Spurs, yet knew not how to apply 'em to his Horse by
riding out of the way


Or as it is frequent with such men, to be in their own way and other men's
together


But what say you to Red-rose, Gentlemen? he seems Peerless hitherto?


If to be judged by the last Course he made, he was not concerned there.


And runs a Wind long and smartly; a Woman would not wish to make a brisker
Course under her Rider


There will be a Wench in our way, I prognosticate.


It Is granted him.


And next, let me advise thee, Trainsted, to take care how thou do trust too
many Guineys on Iron-grays; they are a sort of ill-natured beast, I can tell
you


I thank you, Sir.


But what for the Geldings Match?


Both Jades, it may be: Give me a creature that is not pruned in those parts.


Spoke like a Horseman.


And a Woman's man too, Bowser: He could be no sportive Humanity, that first
made Eunuch of Man or Animal. Give me some Wine; here is a health to his
Majesty, he is our pleasure and being in all kinds

And next let us have a Song.

THough sports of the Field
Their pleasures may yield,
As the Hound or the Horse does run:
Yet there is no such delight
As the Bed at night,
Where Woman is surest won.
Let men sport, drink, or play,
Or take business in their way,
The Females Intrigue will be
The pastime at last,
Which Nature does most haste,
To start with her he and she.
Then Love is man's pleasure,
And will be his leisure,
What respites soever it make:
As Women dress at home,
Or from abroad Men come,
It Is odds they would it partake.

What have I here? her Glove -- Nay, her Name written within it too! -- And
next a Dance, Horsemen


There Is not such a Town as this in Europe, to detain men in it when they least
think on it


Thou art so mistaken now, I was just thinking to match Wagtail this night; I
forgot to tell thee on it


I guess what Wagtail you mean: If I stay long here, I shall fall foul on my
Washer-woman, do what I can


To me, Gentlewoman?


And from Madam Jocalin too.


It Is welcome.


I am glad on it for your sake: But she bids me let you know, that it is her
desire you should not open it till she gives leave


Not open it! What should it mean -- Let her know I salute it thus, and will
observe strictly her Commands. One word more; do think she affects me


What else, Sir? I have heard her commend just such a brown or
Nutmeg-complexion as yours


Enough, here is for the -- I cannot but once more kiss it.


Come, let us prepare.


Upon condition we ride post by our own Horns, with a Tivy, Tivy, Tan-tivy,
boys


Or it matters not much if I overtake you about the Green-man, or Eppin;
Trainsted may go with you perhaps; what say thou


Just thinking of a delicate-limb'd creature.


Was ever Huntsman thus drilled by delay?


I guessed as much; but prithee what was the enclosed delivered thee even now?
'Twas not from Madam Jocalin, was it


Grant it so.


How, and not impart such a trifle to thy friend!


I must not, cannot.


No, Sir? --


Not, though it should render my heart most happy, and by thy self acknowledged
too


This shows unfriendly.


Rather unkind in you to press it.


That thou had never been my friend; or that it were no sin to kill thee, and
force it that way from thee


Recall your passion; I am by her commanded otherwise; see if thou dare to
disoblige her first


Commanded, say thou? hang him that dares offend her: Thou't let her know I
did obey most readily


With all my heart. Come, friends, you will stay a while for my sake now?


Trainsted perverted too?


What a just Rascal it is? By the languishment of thine eye and mine together,
thou art well meit


Pull in your Chap, Sir.


And could not clap it and this Cheek together? That as wholesome Ladies
admire as any Paint in Town


And were you not near making a Wench of me, think you?


A thing of nothing, Prettyness, with my Complexion. To encourage thee, such as
are called Honest women hold it no sin to lie with me


Well, it is a wanton age, and every fool finds it -- You are a Gentleman of
conceit, doubtless


As ever lickt honey from Lip, Sweetface. To tell the truth, I was engaged
lately to some six Ladies, so precipitately too -- Thou understand'st me


To assure you, take this as a favor to your lower Lip.


'Slid, She has hurt the very main grace of my Countenance.

I could find in my heart to bustle with thee for it, as I did with the Girl
the other day for her Virginity, though she box'd me all the while


How, Sirrah, abuse a Woman?


It Is Breakbond; I could dissolve into a Jelly me thinks --


Thou Ague-jaw'd Raskal --

Were It not just to sever thy Chaps, and send the Bones to a Dicemaker?


Good Sir, for my dexterity in kissing, excuse me this once.


Kicking is too good for thee, Slave.

And mark me, if thou do but look upon a Woman with thy scurvy temptation
henceforward --


Spare me, and my eye shall not so much as languish after a woman, though she
cry for me


Enough for my sake, Sir.


Excuse me a little -- And more, Sirrah; if a woman pass the Street, and you
think or know her to be a Wench, disturb her if thou dare


By no means, Sir; I Will wait on her to her own, or her friends Lodging, most
respectively


There Is a Conscience to be used to women, whether honest or dishonest, whilst
I wear a Sword I Will justify it -- You have your freedom, Gentlewoman


I thank you, Sir.


To be more sincerely friends, do you want money, Mr. Breakbond?


Not of thine, thou art to mean a fellow to lend it me; Abuse a creature of her
Sex! be gone immediately


May I not so much as take my leave of her?


Not a kiss, without free consent, at your peril.

I may be wanted at the other end of the Town, perhaps on such an account too.


A Gentleman of his worth might well tempt a lukewarm chastity without further
motive


Is it even so?


He comes next, and has observed, I hope.


By the treasures of thy eye, Mrs. Luce, I could not have supposed this
digression of thine


Indeed, thou Pupil of sin!


Thy Knight, I confess, is most serious and vain together, consider that.


For your sake, shall I?


It may not, or it may be a secret, so it be sealed with thy Lip.


Or to come closer, and Ty the kisses after the manner of some Presbyters; Is It
not so, thou motley thing of Faith and Faction


There may be examples, I allow; insomuch that not long since one of our
zealous Expounders was out three times, as his eye roved to catch a smile from
such another Prettiness as thy self


What a fertile Glebe of love have some illegal beliefs! I ever thought it --

Do you see who is coming?


The Knight; once more commiserate my kind Mistress.


Or I Will advise him to send your Genitals to Geneva.

There Is scarce a Sectary comes so near Heaven as a Moral Eunuch amounts to.


Dispense with me yet.


He Is serious at present.


Let me take liberty to lie once more, though I endanger my Exhibition.


You may, or steal, I suppose you are nimble fingered? Now to observe --


How do approve my Luce, Isaac?


Shall I enter her in my Note-book, Sir?


She Is young, and may have some Gayeties as are incident to most Beauties; but
let me tell thee, she is of such a delicious sobriety withal, as may teach the
gravity of a separate Assembly


Not to be doubted, Sir.


Or do think there is any solid danger in such of thy Sect as are called
Prickear'd? the word methinks has much of erection in it


Or an extraordinary business of now and then a Member: according to your
worshipful allowance of serious and vain together


There I am with thee, Pricknote.

And did she not, as I may say, warm thee something, ha! thou know I am
content she should be admired


This is coming to my business.


She has Multiplication in her looks, doubtless, or such a dazzling of sense,
that I was fain to drink her health in a quart of cold Water with a hotheaded
Anabaptist of my acquaintance


This fellow is no zealous Liar --


I commend thy respect and care; and let me tell thee with secrecy, Pricknote,
that I have some Intentions to have her appear naked; and so read a Lecture of
my composing, from her Eyebrows to the extremity of her Waste; were not this a
grave and delicious verbosity, think thou


Above measure, Sir.


Would you so, Sir? -- Or shall I expend your compositions, Knight, with your
Prick-knave here


Nay, thou art to blame, Luce -- Nothing but an Invention of mine, to admire
thy Capacities


You are a Sir Ralph, I confess; or a Gentleman of as deep a reach somewhere as
most now extant


But to be severe, Luce, and against my vanity too!


By my sincerity, you should dispense, Mistress.


Take that, Sirrah; you have an Itch, I perceive.


It Is seasonable to withdraw, though I cannot repent.


And next dilate with what gravity you would have attacked my Virginity.


Yet again, Luce!


Or, declare how you purposely lie in of the Gout to plot for Preferment; Is
not this to be serious and vain at once, Sir


She Will ruin my pretensions -- Do hear, Luce, I know you are kind,
exceeding kind


It Is very possible.


But I have not obliged thee enough; love me, and take what Gold thou will: I
had almost forgot thy Velvetgown; or it may be thou would take the Air,
command my Coach at thy pleasure


You have given me commission, and I Will improve it.


Thus it must be, when wise men cannot live without Love.

But there are a thousand Intrigues in Women, as well as in State, and somewhat
more diversely capacitated; there is no avoiding --


So serious, Knight!


I have told your Ladyship, that there is a certain mixture in all things.


True, and I have found it in my Lawyer.


It Is not impossible: I have just now a Considering cap to put on, upon a deep
account; you will excuse me, Madam


Do you know Mr. Plodwel, Sir?


I hope I do.


And so fine on the sudden, a Sword by your side too!


And dare use it justly.


A valiant piece of Justice; you may do wonders on the Bench hereafter; It may
be hang to a Prisoner, as some have been talked on


There Is nothing on me that I conceive is unbecoming the person which I own;
your judgment, Lady


Then I perceive you can spend money on your self.


Yes, and more, as does become a Gentleman. I know no Bar from Birth or Custom
that forbids a comely use of Clothes and Manners, what e're you may command


But have a care how you clap too many Fees on your Back; (as some raw ones of
your Profession are prone to) the Times are wise and saving, at least not so
frequently litigious as heretofore, when long ease and contention devoured men's
Estates


I have considered fully, Lady.


To cozen me in your self: Alas, I expected an ordinary Suit of Clothes, a few
Shirts, Night-caps, with two or three Folio's, things that suffice very
celebrated of the Long Robe, might have obliged you; or do you intend to set up
for a Wit like some of our sprucer sort of Gallants


I Will study to find some at your service.


But there are few professions that afford it: Perhaps, there is here and there
a Gentleman, that can pass a Repartee, or pretend to write a Play, though they
-- not seldom lament the fate on it six months after


A Head-ake to purpose.


Or I Will take it for granted, that you are so modish as to drink. It may be,
troublesome in it too -- Let me consider, three hundred a year I expect shall be
added to my former demand


I am obliged to deal worthily with you, and cannot do handsomer than to make
it your acquaintance


Speak it, Sir.


I may have inclinations, Lady.


To some other, I suppose.


You are right, Madam; a Gentleman I lately heard on, one that in part assures
my Address to her, of beauty too; and what is more, has an esteem for useful
Science, such as I presume to call my Studies; nor is addicted to that Thrift
or Pride, which some may construe yours: A Genius I might wish to embrace with
mine


Is It come to this?


And something more, Lady; I find you have a flaw in your Fortune.


But not to be filled off at your Bar, I conceive. Yet I remember something --


I have done, Lady.


And can you leave me thus?


If It be your fate, there is no remedy.


But to quit a Gentlewoman in so intricate a fashion --


You thought I wanted Brains too, though my name be Plodwel.


It may be one that loves you too.


Or a proud covetous kindeness -- But no matter -- What think you of coming now
toward me, Lady? you have some thousands that may be better inspected


I find I am touched --


You may suppose I am in haste.


There Is a punishment due to my temper; and it is odds I may feel it, the worst
way too. Your servant, Madam

I conceive you're busy.


She seemed concerned.


As Lovers will be.


There Is a pleasant depth in Love that is hard to fathom.


Not reach my sense yet!


Would I might try, Lady.


Soldiers, and Gentlemen, I conceive you both; yet not able to oblige a woman
to perform one handsome action


It Is in your power to command us, Madam.


Your Manhood, it is like: If not, consequently expect that I should engage you
to hector or fight one another after the new mode, or suitable to the diverse
concern of Honor and Kindness with some Ladies; though it has added so little
to their esteem, that the world has conster'd such Hero's of theirs as some
detriment to their reputation afterward -- I conceive you are friends, and no
less gladly allow it, as I observe you both


Or your eye, as it is quick enough, may be so propense to your inclination, as
to make pathetically your own election: me thinks you might beam more directly
toward some body, Lady -- but as you please


My Choice, mean you? I know it is enough in my power to determine that without
your Counsel, Sir; a taking of one six pence instead of the other is not more
facile: Or is not my Garb and Mien attractive enough to deserve what I require?
or I suppose you find some fault


You are all perfection --


It may be too you would prove it after such a way that humanity does less admire
than blush at: by my life, Gentlemen, I should be loath to give a Man-child
being after your rate of Courtship


Would I might endeavor the close experiment but with half your will, Dame
Haughty


Or grant it to be, which of us shall devise a way that you may appear to us
and the world more excellent


You have hit me, Sir.


I hope I shall do, Lady.


May not we take liberty to laugh at one another a while before we attain this
warm scruple


With all my heart, or I Will smile with you, till when I judge that neither of
you know how to command me worthily; and so Adieu


Is it not just that I should now blame my severe fate in all kinds?


And so be angry with thy Mistress, and the times together; should she pose me
thus a twelvemonth, I could almost forgive thinking for her sake, it is so
generous


Here Is Madam Jocalin, but we are otherwise disposed then for her Mirth at this
time


Thought, work thy will.


Let Madam Clevely know I Will wait on her on horseback, to take the air this
afternoon


I shall, Madam.


He Is here.


Yet more delays?


Thou may allow some Remora's to love, Bowser.


Since it is thus, I Will observe your sport a little.


You perceive this glove, Lady.


You Would best kiss my hand, and call it mine.


I do, and heartily.


And what next?


Methinks you might begin a little, Lady.


And tell you of your Gray Mare, shall I?


By my love, she affects riding, I see it by her dress too; had I Pegasus, I
would present him to you, or make him an ambler purposely for your sake


You Would carry me apace, I perceive.


There Is no creature of divine pleasure but Woman: give me the looses of Love,
the very Tho-sport of Mankind? Is It not so, fair one


But stay, Sir Hotspur, you and I are not ready to start yet. Pray tell me,
were they not Scotch Jockeys, or Divines in blew Caps, that formed the
Scotch-Covenant


Hang 'em, Knaves, a sort of hungry things that preached on Galloways twelve
inches high


No matter what they were -- Cry you mercy, Mr. Trainsted; have you observed
my desires, Sir


Yes, punctually, Madam.


May I take your word? or let me see it:

I understand that you Gentlemen-jockies can lie intolerably, lay two to one on
this side, and three to one of the other; perhaps swear they never saw the Horse
which they have bought, matched, and tried


Men of pleasure may be dispensed with something.


By your leave, Sir, I forgot I was in haste.


She Will not take her kindness back in what she gave me. My spleen labors to
think on it


I hope so; nay, but retard a space, Lady: thou can not be so unkind to
take Horse without me


As for your friend here, I see he has been observant: perhaps has kissed what
this may possibly contain


I did, with all my heart.


I take it kindly; and return it thus --

My Injunction's yet in force.


I am gone again.


You claim a favor, Sir; and though a slight one, I guess you judge it was too
real to be dropped by chance -- I Will say no more


Prove me, and rather than I Will fail thy service, I Will pay my forfeits, and
renounce the jolly sport of Racing for ever


Now I conclude you dissemble.


Confide, and thou shall find me a Rider to purpose: If this take not with
Female Flesh and Blood, what can


Your breeding's course, I had almost forgot it.


Which on you will lay six to four on the best choice now? Let me die without
hearing the cheerful Music of Hounds, if I would not sooner trust a Country
Milk-maid than the most delicate complexion of any She this City most
celebrates


So severe in thy reflections, Bowser!


Did not I tell you of this Twittle-twattle amorous hindrance? As sure as there
are old Women, the Hare I hunted last was a metamorphis'd Witch, I am so
crossed in my humor


Well, Love, thou art an odd trifle as ever had to do with the lower Region of
Providence: How fares thy Spleen now


A little indisposed, but it is vanishing.


Hold up thy Spirit, Trainsted, if but to afflict him; I begin to be unmerciful
to his Pauses


She has perplexed us both: what think if thou and I outdo Leander, and
drown our selves purposely in the Thames before her dressing-window? I care not
if on Horseback too. It Is odds, when both are dead, but she may pity one of us


My flame is not so immoderate, I thank you.


Or should I do it alone, thou would bear me company.


When I do, may I turn Otter, and hunt fish under water too.


Or, what is worse, let us vow never more to see Newmarket.


Worse than all mischiefs.


Or more than ten thousand mischiefs: let me clap thee on the Back for this
resolve however --

You may proceed, Sir.


I must, but know not how.


LEt me hear thee first -- Not found yet --


Nor like to be, Sir; besides five hundred Guineys she has taken with her to
bear her charges


That a man of knowledge should be so unfortunate as to lose his love and his
money at once


Nothing more familiar, Sir, with some Females, than to be paid by one, and
sport with more


Yet she is a Dove, I confess, in some sense.


But no clipping of her Wings from flying, I ever thought it.


Leave me? what say thou, Pricknote.


Mrs. Luce may return, or she may not.

There Is no other construction to be made of woman's desire.


Thou did advise her.


Yes, Sir, and would have pricked such an impression of mine besides in her
Table Book, Heaven bless the Gentlewoman, she is a fair one


I do not conceive thee well.


The more's my grief, she did not: I assure your Worship I whispered to her as
sincere a Concupiscence as was ever conveyed at repetition


My tender Conscienc'd Isaac!


Tenderly inclined indeed, Sir; but she is youthful, and may be instructed.


Thou bid'st me hope; and now I think on it, I remember a sprightly Zealot that
had just such another cast with her eye, 'twas such a manner of being serious
and pleasant together


Most allowable, Sir.


Thanks, kind Isaac.


As much as you please in secret, Mistress.


And you, Knight, with your formal Amor, do you think to detain me here, till
I come to be the discourse of the street and Constable


This heat with me, Luce?


Or else fee the next Bawdy Court to continue your Capacity: Is this your
politic dealing with such flesh and blood as mine is? As I write Gentlewoman,
I could find in my heart to hire some Hector to chastise your lustiness


But did thou not make me hope you would soberly Cajole my delight, Luce?


And hope it if you please still, Sir.


As big as I am, were I all Gold, I think I could yield to be coined into
Guineys for thy sake


Yet could be content to make your enquiry after me, and by this your
Prick-knave too


Let me save you the endeavor of making me dishonest, I beseech you.


Do so then -- And next Sir Amorous, I add not fool, and Knave -- here is your
Money, you may take it, Sir, I Will only whisper a few of your Luxuries and
Politiques into some ears --


Not for a world, Luce -- Hark thee, upon the word of a cautious Sinner, I Will
rather give thee a Thousand pound more to hold thy peace, though thou leave
me for ever


The very Bargain I hoped to make: Farewell Sir. -- These sums put together
may possibly produce a convenient honesty


There Is nothing more hard than to be wise and wanton together -- there may be
discredit too


Were it not for the Emulsion to flesh and blood in being of a public factious
Spirit, I might pity your infirmity


However, I will pretend gravely, or fret against the times, out of vexation
and loss I have vainly given my self


Or I Will protest you are more deeply diligent in the service of Dissenters; you
may yet be held worthy to purchase some capacity


Let me have thy Counsel, Pricknote.


You shall, Sir -- In the mean time I had almost forgot where the Silver Plate
stands


Patience, patience, Gentlemen, you will so disorder my dress else! --


We must make bold to take your person for pawn a while. We Bailiffs are like
some Birds of prey, when we light on any of your Feather, though we do not eat
'em, we plume 'em to purpose


No pity on my fine Face!


It Is somewhat extraordinarily engaged for your Milkwashes to your Butter-woman.


I Will be bold with your Perriwig in behalf of your Barber.


You had as good bestow your Coat in part of satisfaction of your Tailor too.


Take this Money too, and let me be gone half naked.


'Twere somewhat too much.


Not if he give these things freely for our extraordinary attendance.


Should any of my Ladies see me thus --


We'll keep your counsel, so you will be worth us something more for that*


Who have you here, Lads?


A Gentleman that lives under the Law, but does not care to pay Money.


Is that all? I do as much my self; though I give, I as seldom pay as most men
living


You have taught us to know it, Sir.


Whiffler, I had almost forgot thy Countenance; do your office; friends; he is
not deserving enough of Mankind to violate the Law


We thank you, Sir; and when ever a Writ comes to us against you, we'll cast it
into the fire without presuming to show it you


Except at the suit of a Woman, and under forty too, conceive me -- in that
case I Will see it paid


You may command us, Sir.


Favor me something, though you borrow more money of me in spite of my teeth.


Or, now I think on it, you may let him have his Clothes again; and for the
rest, take his word till to morrow, he will make it good


On yours, Sir?


Yes, on mine, Sirrah; if I break my Bond, I am a Gentleman if I promise.


Cry you mercy, Sir -- There Is no daring of his Anger.


You see what it is when such fine Gentlemen as you can pay money, and will not
without this trouble


Well, I Will hide my self for a time, or go into the Country, and try whether I
can make love to Dairy-maids. This is some comfort to a Skin that is too fine
to be seasoned with cold


What sly fellow's that? we'll venture to stay him in behalf of the Constable.
-- Who, Isaac Pricknote, the very'st Knave in all the Borough of Southwark


Excuse me, I have strict occasion --


There Is something under his Arm.


Nothing but a Cawdle I am to convey to a friend.


You may keep your Cawdle when you have it, but we'll seize on this piece of
Plate


Sir Ralph Nonsuch's name on it too.


What if 'twere said we found it by chance?


With all sincerity you may.


Some Roguery, but no theft, brother Catchpole.


We'll search him again -- There will be a reward from the Knight to us however.


The Other piece of Plate too! You must before the next Justice. He deserves to
be hanged twice, if possible


No pity for the transgression of a Zealot!


Away with him.


Worthy disposer of Writs and Parchment, well met.


I thank you, Sir.


Thou honour'st thy profession in thy esteem of Women; there is no such mine and
thine, that Mortality has to do with; go on and prosper


I conceive you, Sir.


And more, I will pardon the Law, though somewhat a crabbed method of generous
Education, for thy sake -- farewell. One word more; I find thou art a
Gentleman, and when thou have a mind to Dice or Drink, I Will forward thy
ingenuity that way too: And now to find the gang of Pleasure with Swiftspur


An odd extravagance, but time may recall him: She Is come -- You may command my
observance, Madam


You told me of a truth concerned me.


I did, and am prepared to make it good.


As little frivolous, or tedious, as you please; I have heard of Chancery-bills.


Your words are too much pointed, or Woman's way of reasoning, as if they owned
their being to no other right than what they call their Beauty. What does your
Sex confer to civil happiness, more than their persons, and their Milk to
nourish Children? whilst its best reason, and its safety's none of yours; you
must excuse my freedom, Lady


Or think me still both proud and miserable, I know your grievance.


Add, if you please, a person in my sense most lovely, joined to a quick and
taking spirit, yet even such a soul, may like a Diamond that is set too narrow
in the finest Gold, straiten its luster. Am I right, Madam


Is this my business, Sir?


I have brought it, Madam.

Here Is a Writing will express the right I have to make you mine.


It was my dead Father's act when I was young --


And that if ever you married other man, you was to pay me out of your Estate
five thousand pound


It Is not to be denied.


I have done, Lady.


In so much haste too!


Or now I think on it, I Will wave it yet, and give you freedom to oblige some
other choice -- I hope I have performed my devoir now


This touches home, In money too -- Well, Sir, you may be pleased to think you
have prevailed; I suppose on your terms and mine together I may deserve you


Above my wishes.


May I not congratulate, Lady?


I here have owned my happiness.


I rejoice it with you, worthy Plodwel -- My addressors come, we'll give 'em
leave a little


Well, I am so far happy as to have done with thinking.


Could not lend a thought to help thy friend, thou conceiv'st me?


Not a Chimera, though no bigger than an Atom: It may be I may give a past
thought for thee and my self together


Well, I begin now to vex with thee at this word Thinking.


Which of you begins? you may be free.


He that knows best how, Lady.


Is that all? I begin to perceive your delays unkind.


To discipline a Lady of your sense, and in point of love too! By my Sword, I
had rather command for the French, though I love not their Party


Or you may move for your self and friend together, Passal.


I feel some temptation that way in spite of my spirit, but I must away with
it -- Well, Madam, since it is your will I must enjoin, I hope to fit your worth
and mine together -- Give me thy hand, Maldrin, you have my command Lady to
take my friend. There Is no injunction I conceive more honorable, or happiness
I shall impose on your respects: he will merit most your worth


A generosity I looked for.


Brain, I thank thee.


I fear too great for me to own; I have seen some handsome actions in the
world, but few can equal this in Friendship -- I must return her to your hand:
I had your leave to impose, Madam, as well as he


A thread bare Method used in Plays; Thou never could less deserve my
friendship. The offer is enough to make me angry, is it not, Lady


A Passal indeed; and must be, next your Obligation, my first of friends;
you will give me leave to assure it, Sir


Above my own and your expression.


No such Thinking neither; remember I find not that your fault again, Maldrin.


I warrant you.


He Will grant it for my sake.


You have abundantly obliged me.


And next to quit that saucy thing called public Merit, there will be much
that falls below desert, though in the best and wisest Governments: My love and
fortune shall oblige it


Now I may bid you happy.


This day stands fair to all our wishes.


Let Us find Jocalin.


O Horsemen, Horsemen!


What Is the matter?


The heaviest tidings; I saw our own Swiftspur lean with his Hat on his Eyes at
a Tables end: if I forget not, booted too


Who could have thought it in him?


He Is Lovesick, it is certain. And for Mr. Trainsted, what his spleen may
produce, Heaven knows: at present it seems with him worse than in a hot season
that admits not to give his Courses their due exercise


Might Cupid be so kind as to dispatch one of his Bolts to this jolly Mistress
of theirs, I care not much which of them were his Deputy


But as for my Bess, my lovely brown Bess, that kissed me so often betwixt the
sips of Ale and Apples, and looked more red than the best ruby streaks of a
Gillyflower, how could I hug her in conceit


May not I do as much, think thou, for a bucksome Kate of my acquaintance?


Notwithstanding she lives, as I guess, at the sign of the No-maidenhead
somewhere. It Is odds but our Fellow-riders may take wrong Forfeitures for some
of our absence


If not swear that most of us are so drily in love, as to engage our
Field-spirits with City-chamber-maids; I could burn my Whip to think on it


Here comes Trainsted, and has her by the hand already; it is fit we attend.


Your Obligements I need not further press; they may answer my expectation
fully


And shall, Madam.


May I take your word?


And deed too; you cannot command any thing on your account, but I Will most
readily embrace


This heightens to my end.


She speaks of ending: I wish her a kiss extraordinary for it.


Observe my Face once more; and next, are you sure my best resemblance fits
your kindest welcome


I vow it does.


It Is granted then.


Granted, says she?


Yes, Swiftspur; nor ought you to repine, if I should give to him more than due
modesty can claim to be my own desert; do you understand me yet


I understand too much, thou smooth-faced intricacy.


Then I Will unfold my self -- Give me the enclosed, Sir, I see it is yet unopen'd.


'Twas your command it should.


Behold this Figure; is it not well limbed?


But in my eye 'tshould be short of the Original.


Thy expression well deserves it -- I dare bestow it thus before you, Sir.


Ha, her Picture given him too!

My heart, I feel it sink too low to aid my feet.


O, Mr. Bowser, what will become of our Darling Swiftspur?


Does he lie there?


Yes, and struck down merely by the breath of this Lady too!

Good Gentleman, he should have tried to have blown her down first.


I dare venture him; I scarce read of any of his Sex that ever di'd for love
but in a Romance


Best of all, Lady: And if dead, it is no matter; he may be afterward flung
into the Thames; he talked of cooling his Flames, I remember


I die for Love! a mere accidental qualm; did thou and I ever speak of Love,
Lady? What say thou, Trainsted


I Will speak for him: Observe this Gentlewoman, she is the true Original I did
entrust you with


So like your self, she is more than taking; I Will not impose further on your
wishes


My Twin and only Sister -- I dare make good her gift. What say thou, Flora;
his person thou have seen before


Your choice is mine, you have already taught my inclinations duly to value
his respects; I need add nothing more


You have won me in her fair affection.


I told you it should be a strict and near obligement to my self.


I am bound to accept her.


For you, Sir, and your Gallopers, you may be in greater haste than I Will
suppose; perhaps I can as readily grant that you and I but dreamt of Love


I Will die in earnest first; I know thou dare not suffer it. A kiss, and so
join hands


You are one of the eag'rest men, and possible to ride post with me.


Thou have me home In Faith.


But you will hardly reach me so. Let me see your face -- You may study the point
better, or guess it presently


By that eye of thine, thou Creature of mirth and wonder, there is no avoiding
me


Then I must be yours it seems: I ever designed a brief and cheerful Courtship.


What think thou of the looses of Love I shall make now, Bowser?


That I Will make better if I can.


I ever thought you would match your Wagtail before you departed.


We are more than Brothers now; I Will not have other Wager with thee, than which
of us shall make the best Woman's Rider


But it is odds my Boy will cry first for a Hobbyhorse; he will soon have an
inclination to ride astride, I can tell thee


You are pleasant.


Jocalin, bestow your hand on these, they are faithful Jockies, and love to win
heartily --


Or if she please, I Will begin below, and so kiss upwards, as I rejoice your
happiness


Trainsted joined to your Sister Flora?


He is, Madam.


And by this kind Lady's Artifice, I thank her.


Ladies and Gentlemen, I am yours: You Will all be for Newmarket now. I am the
man to bid you welcome


With all our hearts.


What say you, Lady? becoming pleasure I dare own with such good Company.


What you think fit, Sir.


Thy judgment may compose some Articles amongst us there.


If not too intricate.


Or such of the nicer sort that are full of Dispute and little Reason.


Your pastimes shall command my assistance; I love 'em well, your Joyntures too
I Will make


By any means.


Plodwel, I rejoice your happiness; my choice is made already in my friends.


I perceive it, and judge it no less worthy in you both. Your part of
commendation does most speak it, Madam


My love and estimation of both these obliged it.


Bowser, do not long to be before at Bishops-stafford, and kiss thou know
who, at the Rain-deer, in thine and my behalf


I Will have none of your cold scents, I thank you.


Perhaps we'll dine there; but no Maidenhead to be won but at Newmarket.


Jock. Agreed, agreed, agreed.


Thou were wanted, Breakbond.


To thy Men and Women-friends.


And to thy Newmarket-friends.


As I honor Women and Mirth, I could not help it. No less than a dozen pretty
rogues looked out of Windows two stories high to stay my coming to you: it is
such a necessitous loving world


And will be always so with thee.


Besides a business of some importance with the next Constable.


Not for assaulting him and his Watch, I hope.


I have had cause, but I leave that disorder to such as dare only fight when
they are drunk


And pay for the offense when they are sober.


And fit they should.


To be short, with a few good words and more Silver, I have reduced that legal
sort of Knave to so much Conscience, as not to molest the King's loving
Subjects of Men and Women: Or to think that at one, two, or three a Clock in
the Morning they may not have their Congressions without his leave, or a
shilling for him and his Watch to drink. I have some thought to make my
Applications to Justices of the Peace to the same purpose. It Is such a crime to
nature to think that Mankind should live and love orderly --

I had almost forgot you, Ladies.


Well, thou have a pleasant way of Raillerie.


He shall wager on our side -- What think thou, Bowser?


I would I were rid of this trifling, lest I be so far debauched as to conceive
that there is other ingenious discourse than of Hounds and Horses


Thou art a wild one, but time has altered some.


Or let it ruin me beyond the imbecility of ten Ages of gray Hairs, provided
I might but live to behold no fading in your Sex, 'twere such an Autumn to my
Genius


Now you oblige us all.


Or we'll commend you to a fair one.


Marry, Ladies, it may be if I live to be old in spite of my humor, or when I
am good for little more than to retire, perhaps I Will ask a License of
Womankinde, and espouse one


We'll hope it sooner for your sake.


Ladies and Gentlemen, Sir Ralph Nonsuch desires your excuse, being a little
indisposed at present


Perhaps with the fond conceit of his Politics.


It Is not unusual with him.


Besides some disaster within the compass of his most private Circle.


In spite of his prudence too, what a smile does he deserve!


But even now I understood it: No less than his fine Miss departed with some
hundreds of his Guineys, together with some Plate of his embez'led by a
thieving Separatist of his acquaintance


It Is odds but he will come to thee for counsel, Plodwel. There Is no maintaining
Suit, did not Fools and Knaves make up the greatest number of Contenders


The very dishonor of so noble a Science as Law and its Professors.


God-a-mercy worthy Pleader -- You are happy now indeed, Lady.


I grant it fully.


Some mirth at London first -- Here Is Music waits us.


Let Us kiss, and next to Horse.


I Will see thee well mounted, Breakbond; thy mirth deserves respect.


I have been often, I thank some kindness, though I scarce had ever yet Horse
of my own: There Is a certain kind of Providence in living well, men know not
how


Bowser, thou shall lead the Road; we'll ride, laugh, talk, alight, and what
you please, Ladies --

It Is time our Pleasures hasten on their way;
Who loves Newmaket, will clap hands to day.

Mr Part was Mirth, and Jocund, as you see,
I bring the Epilogue along with me.
And I have been, as I presume you will say,
As merry as most Ladies in a Play;
And'tis loves Mirth best suits the Comic way.
Nor doubt I, Ladies, but it is known to you,
That some Newmarket-lads are Lovers too.
Men that quick pleasures swiftly can employ,
Most Women graut their speed, their love enjoy.
Wit they pretend to, as you Gallants do,
Who, though called Wits, like them lose money too.
Yet know in Matches no such booty way's,
As they who here cry up or damn our Play's.
Then Critics have a care what you commit,
Lest here our Jockeys with you wager Wit.
They know your stingy slights, and how inclined,
And what to Crony Poets is designed;
Whilst this our Author does by me afford
Not so much for his Play as one kind word.
Or tells you that his Scenes or Wit are new,
Which some, that boast much wit, want wit to show.
We for a Play such Wits did all approve,
Got little Money, we played all for Love.
