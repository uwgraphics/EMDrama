TO begin particularly to wright of these attempts, and briefly to run over
^ache s^uerall action, the cause of the same is first to be considered. After
the arrival of the French Ambassadors, and upon their coming to the English
court, The Nobles and Gentlemen of the same, desirous to show them alcourtesie
poss^ble fittest for such estates, and to sport them with all courtly
pleasure, agreede among them to prepare a Triumph, which was very quickly
concluded, and being devised in most su^ptuous order, was by them performed in
as valiant a manner, to their endless fame and honor. The chief, or
challengers in these attemptes, were these. The Earl of Arundel, the Lord
Windsore Master Philip Sidney, and Master Fulke Grevill, Who calling themselves
the four Foster Children of Desire, made their invention of the foresaid
Triumph in this order and form following

The Gallary or place at the end of the Tiltyard adioining to her Majesty's
house at Whiteball, Fortress of perfect beauty, for as much as her highness
should be there included, whereto the said Foster children laid Title and
claim as their due by descent to belong unto them. And upon denial or any^
cpulse from that their d^s^red pa^rimonie, they vowed to vanquishe and conquer
by force who so should seem to wit^stand it. For the accomplishing whereof
they sent their challenge or first defiance to the Q^eens majesty: which was
vttred by a boy on Sunday, the sixt^enth of April last, as her Majesty came
from the Chapel, who being apparrelled in red and white, as a Martial
messenger of Desires fostered Children, without making any pr^cise reverence at
all, uttered these speeches of defiaunce, from his masters to her Majesty, the
effect whereof ensues

O Lady, built by nature is seated in this Realm: These four I say and say
again, thus nourished, thus animated thus entitled, and thus informed, do
will you by me, even in the name of Justice, that you will no longer exclude
virtuous DESIRE from perfect BEAV TIE? VVhereto if you yield, (O yield for so
al reason requires) then have I no more to say, but rejoice that my sayings
has obtained so righfull, and yet so blissful a request. But if (alas but
let not that be needful) BEAVTIR be accompanied with disdainful pride, and
pride vvaighted on by refusing cruelty. Then must I denounce unto you (VVoe is
me, answer before it be denounced) that they determine by request to
accomplish their claim, And because they will better testify to the world,
they have been brought up under the vvings of honorable DESIRE, this honorable
forevvarning they send you. That upon the xxiiii day of this month of April
they will besiege that fatal FORTRESS, vowing not to spare (if this
obstinacy continue) the svvoorde of faithfulness, and the fire of affection?
Now if so it fall out, the vvorthie knights of your Court (moved with
passion in them selves) disdain of my senders boldness, or partial liking
(which I most doubt) to the majesty of your eyes, will either bid them
battle before they approach, or suffering them to approach, will after la^or to
l^uye the siege, They protest to meet them in what sort they will choose,
vvihning only it may be performed before your own eyes, whom they know
as even in judgment, as dainty in choosing, where if so they list. First at
the Tilte in so many courses, as your self shall please to appoint. And then if
any will call them to the course of the field with Lance and svvord, they hope
to give such true proofs of their valler, as at least shall make their desires
more noble, vovving on the other side, that if before the night part the fray,
they do not overcome al the^ that come in against them, they vvil yield
themselves slaves unto you for ever? This therefore O Queen (greater in that
you are Queen of your self, then in passing the whole compass of the earth)
have I delivered my charge, not as a challenge to your knights? against
whom, (but in so just a cause) they acknovvledge themselves unable to match
the meanest, But as a plain proclaimation of War, unless the FORTRESS OF
BEAVTIE, that has vvoon so many to lose themselves, be speedily surrendered:
And now it shall be seen what knights you have, whom BEAVTIE may draw to
resist a rightful title, And I for my pore part moved by that I see in you
(though I serve your enemies) will daily pray that all men may see you, and
then you shall not fear any arms of adversaries: Or if enemies you must have,
that either they may have the minds of them that send me, or their fortunes in
that they have long desired

At which day abouesaid for certain urgent occasions, May: And so till Whitson
Monday, when they first began to perform it

The said day being come, the four Foster children had made preparation to
besiege the Fortress of Beawtie. And thereto had provided a frame of wood
which was covered with Canuas, and painted outwardly in such excellent order,
as if it had been very natural earth or moulde, and carried the name of a
Rolling trench, Beauty. These things thus al in a readiness, the Challengers
approached, and came from the Stable toward the Tyltyard, one after another in
brave and excellent order. And the manner of their several entrings was as
follows

First, Arundell entered the Ty^teyarde, all in Gylt and engraven Armor, with
Caparisons and furniture richly and bravely embrodered, having attendaunt on
him, Two gentlemen vshers, iiii. Paages riding on four spare horses, and
twenty of his Gentlemen. Al which aforesaid were apparayled in short Clokes
and venetian hose of Crymson velvet, laid with gold lace, doublets of yellow
Satin, hattes of Crymson velvet with gold bands and yellow feathers, and yellow
silk stocks. Then had he six tump^^^ers that sounded before him. And xxxi.
^eomen that waited after him apparailed in Cassock coats, and venetian hose of
Crimson velvet, laid on which red silk and gold lace, Duble^s of yellow
taffatie, Hats of crimson Taffatie, with yellowe feathers, and yellowe worsted
stockings

After him proceeded the Lord Windsore, in short cloaks of scarlet, lined
through with orange tawnie taff^tie, and laid about with silver lace, Dublets
of orange taw^y Satin, venetia^hose of orange tawnie velvet, black velvet
caps, with silver bands and white feathers, and silu^red rapiers and daggers,
with scabberds o^blacke velue^. Four trumpetters, and ^wo footmen in cassocke
coats and ven^tian hose of orange tawnie velvet, and black velvet caps with
silver bands and white feathers, four gromes of his stable leading of his four
horses, in cassocke coats and venetian hose of orange tawnie ^affatie, and
orange tawnie feltes with silver ^ands, and white feathers. Then had he three
score yeomen in coats of Orange tawnie clothe, with the Unicorn of of silver
plate on their sleeves, and orange tawnie feltes with silver bands and white
feathers

Then proceeded M. Philip Sidney, with gold and silver feathers, very richly
and cunningly wrought, he had four pages y^ rode on his four spare horses, who
had cassok coats and venetia^ hose al of cloth of silver, laid with gold lace,
and hats of y^ same with gold bands, and white feathers, and each one a pair
of white buskins. The^ had he a thirty gentlemen and ^eomen, and four
trumpetters, who were all in cassoke coats and venetian l^ose of yellow velvet,
laid with silver lace, yellowe velvet caps with silver bands and white feathers,
and every one a pair of white buskins. And the had upon their coats, a
scrowle or band of silver, which came scarce wise over the shoulder, and so
down under the arm, with this po^^^e, or sentence written upon it, both
before and behind, Sicnos non nobis

Then came M. Fulke Gr^uill, in gylt armor, Ierkins of Tawnie taffatie, cut
and lined with yellowe sarsenet, and laid with gold lace, and cut down the
arm and set with loopes and buttons of gold, Uenetian hose of the same lined
as asoresaid, laid with gold lace down the side with loopes and buttons of
gold, with each a pair of yellow worsted stockings. And ha^ts of Tawnie
Taffarie with gold bands and yellow Feathers. Having thus all entered the Tilte
yard, they proceeded on with the rolling trenche before them, which stayed
against the Queen, and they passed by, as though they would behold the
Fortress of Beauty. And so went about the Tilt, At last the boy that uttered
the first deflaunce pronounced these speeches to her Majesty

If the message lately delivered unto you had been believed and followed. the
defense of obstinate refusal there never grows victory but by compassion? They
are come, what need I say more, you see them, ready in heart as you know, and
able with hands as they hope, not only to assailing but to prevailing.
Perehance you despise the smalnesse of number, I say unto you, the force of
DESIRE goes not by fullness of company. Nay rather View with what irresistable
determination themselves approach, And how not only the heavens send their
invisible Instrument to aid them. But also the very earth the dullest of all the Elements which with natural heaviness still strives to the sleepie
Center,

Which speech being ended, the Rowlling trench or Mount of earth was moved as
nere the Queens Majesty as might be, which being settled, the music played
very pleasauntly, and one of the Boys being then accompanied with Cornets,
summoned the Fortress with this song

Yield yield, O yield, you that this FORTE do hold,
which seated is, in spotless honors fi^lde,
Desires great force, no forces can withhold:
then to DESIERS desire, O yield O yield.
Yield yield O yield, trust not on beauties pride,
fayrenesse though fayer, is but a feeble shield,
When strong Desire, which virtues love does guide,
claymes but to gain his due, O yield O yield.
Yield yield O yield, who first this Fort did make,
did it for just Desires, true children build,
Such was his mind, if you another take:
defense herein does wrong, O yield O yield,
Yield yield O yield, now is it time to yield,
Before thaslault begin, O yield O yield.
When that was ended, another Boy turning him self to the Foster children and
their retinue, sung this Alarm

Alarm alarm, here will no yielding be,
such marble ears, no cunning words can charm,
Courage therefore, and let the stately see.
that naught withstandes DESIRE, Alarm alarm.
Alarm alarm, let not their beauties move
remorse in you to do this FORTRESS harm,
For since war is the ground of virtues love,
no force, though force be used Alarm alarm.
Alarm alarm, companions now begin,
about this never conquered walls to swarm,
More praise to us we never look to win,
much may that was not yet, Alarm alarm.
Alarm alarm when once the fight in warm,
then shall you see them yield, Alarm alarm.
Which ended, the two Canons were short off, Desire, All which did continue
till time the Defendaunts came in

Then came in the defendaunts in most sumptuous manner,

First M. Henry Gray, Sir Thomas Parat, Anthony Cook, M. Th^mas Ratcliffe,
Master Henry Knowles, M. William Knowles, M. Robert Knowles. M. Frauncis
Knowles, M. Raffe Bows, M. Thomas Kelway, M. George Goring, M. William
Tresham, M. Robert Alexander, M. Edward Dennie, M. Herculus Meautus, M. Edward
Moore, M. Richard Skipwith, M. Richard Ward, M. Edward Digibie, M. Henry
Nowell, M. Henry Brunkerd. And afterward in the midst of the running, came
in Sir Henry Lea, as unknowen, and when he had broken his six staves, went out
in like manner again

So passing on one after another, when sir Thomas Parat and M. Cook came to
the end of the Tilt, over against the Queens Majesty, one of their pages
arraied like an Angel, vttred these speches unto her

Despair, if DESIRE ouershoote duty, there is no reason, and where either of
these are, there can be no rule. And so setting more sighs then may be
numbered by syphers, this present time, (ah grief) this present time, that
honest and fair hearted frozen Knighte died, (what said I) even that which
again with grief I must say died, whose ghost making speedy passage into the
ELISIAN fields (for what more swifte then a soul) in the midst of the
infernal multitude, with s^re^ches, cries and clamers, made both Heaven and
hell to redouble this Echo, shall deprive them the sauegarde, yet command
them to be humble in affection, though ^^^uente, least they seem to disdain
that pride (...), which they desire themselves, their pretense, So your laying
challenge upon claim, and conquest upon challeng, may well prove a will but no
worthiness, A desire to reach, but no possibility to recover, In which your
soaring attemptes if you chance to fall, the only comfort you have, is to cry
with PHAETOn MAGNIS EXCIDIMVS AVSIS: But if no persuasions may move your minds:
Know ye proud Knights, there are that have hearts as big as mountains, and as
far above you in provvesse, as ye are above all in presumption, yet not so
vain (which ye term valiant) to assault the sun, and why, because it is
impregnible, we content to enjoy the light, ye to eclipse it, we to rest
under the feet, ye to run over the head, we to yield to that which nothing
can conquer, you to conquer that which makes all men Captives. But wear it
possible, that head could devise, courage attempt, or hand execute any thing
that might show the depth of our vnspot ted Loialty, soon should be seen
(and for your selves to soon) that your enterprises should be of as small
account then, as now they are of lightlihood, to deep an impressi^n is
engraven in our thoughts, for the majesty of that sun which now pearcing
our eyes has fully subdued our hearts, that we are pressed in her defense to
offer the whole world defiance, In proof whereof I am charged to throvve
down his Gauntler, which who so dares take up, shall feel both the heat
of their just conceived quarrel, and the reproach of their own deserved
folly, not my riding in breaking a fevve staves to end the strife, but at
Tournie or what else so ever they can devise or dare adventure for to vvin the
benefit of BEAVTIE, Thus most renoumed and divine BEAVTIE, whose beams
shine like the Sun, have ADAM and EVE adventured to defend the Sun, the same
I call Beauty the light of the world, the marvel of men, the mirour of
nature, on which their encounter, if those favorable gleams may fall, they
vvil not only think to have done good herein, but to be restored ag^ine to
Paradi^e, the one means to repose his trust in a woman, who like Eve cannot
be beguiled, the other to rest on a Saint, which by a Serpent will not be
tempted, Thus being placed in the Garden of your Graces, O of all things most
gracious where virtues grovve as thick as leaves did in Paradise. They will
take heedeto taste of the forbidden fruit, contented to behold, not coveting
to take hold, And for that it has bin long argued, and no arguing can end?
whether the first offense came by the crudelitie of ADAM, or the simplicity
of Eve, the one defending his fault by sound arguments, the other excusing
hers by sharp answers, they most humbly s^e for this, that either by Six
courses between them the quarrel may be ended, or by your highness peremptory
sentence determined, for they both being in the world are desirous that one
might bear the blame of both, And what herein your excellency shall set
down, there is none shall gainsay, For whenever the question shall be moved,
No other reason shall be allowed then this

Elizabetha dixit.

This speech being thus ended, Sir Thomas Parat, and M. Cook proceeded backward
on the other side of the Tilte, And when M. Ratcliffe came likewise against the
Q^^ene, one of his Pages pronounced these speeches in his Masters behalf to her
Majesty

So many were the misfortunes, (most renoumed and beavvtifull Princess) of
the desolate knight my master, his strange diet and new conceits, he became
so enchaunted, that neither the remembrance of others, nor a thought touching
himself could enter into his mind: An alteration seldom heard of, that the
place vvhere^s he vv^s shrovvded in, should make him to forget who he is?
Living thus a long time for that no limme should seem short, rising according
to ^^s manner to walk in the moss in the grisping of the day he espied upon
the shore certain men either cast away by shipvvrake, or cast ouerborde by
Pyrattes, unto whom he went and perc^^^ing by their pl^ints one which lay
dead amongst the^ to be their master, enquired whence they were, but they not
vvilling to repeat their misfortunes, opened the bosom of the gentleman, and
pulled out as crovvle containing a claim, a challenge, nay a conquest of
BEAVVTIE. At the sight vvherof, suddenly (quoth he) Beavvtie, and therevvithall
apalled paused, entering by little and little out of his present M^LANCHOLI^S into
his former misfortunes, who as one avvaked out of a long dream, began thus
to debate. O Beavvtie where thy Fortress is sounded I know, but what these
brethren should mean I mar^ile, for as I am assured that to win thee none
could be so fortunate, so did I (...) that to claim thee none could be so
fond, when as thou O divine BEAVVTIE art of every one to be desired, but
never to be conquered of DESIRE. But as the Eagle beholding the sun, cou^teth
to build her ^est in the same, and so dimmeth her sight. So they vevving the
brighnesse of BEAVVTIE are incensed to conquer it by DESIRE. And what then?
because she is invincible shall I be indifferent. No, I will forsake this
caytifly Cottage, and will take Arms to defend that BEAVVTIES CASTLE.
Nothing shall remove me from mine attempt, which being performed, nothing can
move me, yea but she has servants already a number, I but unless I be
there, not the whole number, but many were famous but none more faithful,
yet alas, if thou go, thou shall ever be unfortunate, better alvvaies
infortunat, then one disloyal, which words being ended, he demanded whether
they vvoulde in like case adventure with one of no less courage then their
master, but certainly of greater affection: Whose service he having upon small
entreatie obtained, for that belyke they were desirous to see the event for the
which they had suffe^ed such adventures, he departed to his cave, hevving a
shield out of the hard cliffe enriched only with soft moss: A double sign
of his desire, thinking that nothing could manifest BEAVVTIE so well as
PITHAGORAS wallunt, a tender ^yne and a hard shell. And now most excellent
and divine BEAVVTIE, divine it must needs be that works so heavenly,

Which speech being ended, Frauncis Knowles, on after another, according to
their age, and all in like armor, who coming to the end of the Tilt, stayed
till these speeches were vttred by one of their Pages, who being apparailed
like unto Mercury, pronounced these speeches in the Knights behalues to her
Majesty

Report has bruted all abroad, though they feed not fat therevvith, yet must
they either feed thereon or fast, for BEAVVTIE is the only bait vvhereon
DESIRE bites, and love the chief restoritie that lady BEAVVTIE likes, so that
she ca^ no more be left without meat, then men can live with out minds: Of
all affections that are, DESIRE is the most vvorthie to vvoe, but least
deserves to win BEAVVTIE, for in vvinning his saint he loses him self,
no sooner has desire what he desires, but that he dies presently: So that
when BEAVVTIE yields once to desire, then can she never vaunt to be desired
again: Wherefore of force this principle must stand it is convenient for
DESIRE ever to vvish, nec^ssarie and that he alvvaies want, O rare and most
renowned BEAVVTIE, O gods to be honored of all, not to be equalled of any,
become not now a prisoner, your FORTRESS is invincible, no doubt DESIRE
will content him self with a favorable parley, and weight for grace by
loyalty not challenge it by lavvnce, although he make nere so brave, the
vvordle does know, that Ladi^ BEAVVTIE needs no rescue to raise this siege,
for that she sits above al reach, her heavenly looks above when she so listes
can dazell all men's eyes. But though she list not use those means, yet it is
meet that all her servants come and shevve them selves devout to do her vvil^
perchance her pleasure is to see the fortes tried of these iiii. FOSTER
friends. O happy, ten times happy they whose hap shall be with favor of
her D^^^^^, to take in hand this brave attempt: In hope whereof these iiii
legitimate sons of Despair, bre thren to hard mishappe, suckled with
sighs, and svvathed up in sorrow, vveaned in vvo, and dry nursed by DESIRE,
long time fostered with favorable countenance, and fed with svveet
fancies, but now of late (alas) wholly given over to grief and is disgraced by
disdain, are come with ready hearts and hands, to prove against these other
4. that DESIRE does not deserve one vvinke of good favor from Lady BEAVTIES
smiling eyes, for threatening to win her, forte by force? They dout not the
victory if only they may find some little show from their Saint in favor of
their enterprise. If Mercury have said amiss, blame those bright beams
which have be^eft him of his wit, if well, v^uchsafe one beck to bid him
pack away

These speeches being ended, both they and the rest marched about the Till,^and
so going back to the nether end thereof prepared themselves to run, Fame has
the same reported

When this days sport was thus accomplished, the boy that uttered the
defiances, in these few speeches took his goodnight of the Queen

In the trial of this debatefull question (O your self) then with what can
be said more,

The next days show was done in this order. Desire, entered in a brave
Chariot, (very finely and curiously decked) as men f^rewearied and half
overcome, The chariot was made in such sort as upon the top the 4 knights
sat, with a beautiful Lady, representing Desire about them. Whereunto their eyes
were turned, in token what they desired, In the Lu^ke of (...) Chariot was
conveyed room ^or a full consort of Music, who played still very doleful
music as the Chariot moved, the chariot was drawn by four horses according
to the four knights, which horses were apparelled in White and carnation
silk, being the colloures of Desire, and as it passed by the upper end of the
Tylt, a Harrault of Arms was sent before to utter these speeches in the
knights behalf to her Majesty

No confidence in themselves, limits, Not any slight regarding the force of
your valliant knights, has encoura^ed the Foster children of Desire to make
this day an inheritour of yesterdayes action: ^ut the wing of Memory alas
the sworn enemy to the wofullmans qui^tnesse, being constantly held by the
hand of perfection, And never ceassing to blow the cole of some kindled
Desire, has brought their inward fire to blaze forth this flame vnquench^ble
by any mean^s (...) by death the whole fuel be consumed, and therefore not
able to master it, they are violently bo^^e whether desire draws. Although
they must con^es (alas^^) that yesterdayes brave onse^ should come to such a
confession: That they are not greatly companied with hope, the common supplie^
to Desi^es army. So as now from summoning this Cast^l to yield, they are
fallen lowly to beseech you to vouchsafe your eyes out of that Impregnable
Fortress to behold what will fall out betwixt them and your famous knights:
wherein though they be so eu^^pressed with the others vallure that a^ready
they could uneath have been able to come (...)* if the chariot of Desire had
not carried them, yet will they make this whole assembly vvitnesses so fai^e
of their vvil, That sooner their souls shall leave their bodies then Desire
shall leave souls: In that on^lye stands their strength that gave them th^^
first courage, and must be their last comfort. For what resistance is there
where not only they are met with fo^ren enemies, such as stately disdain,
which looks from so high a Tower to pore Desire. That though (in it self) it
be great yet in her eyes (so seated) it seems small or such on the other
side as unfortunate despair, which makes the count^ie so barren where they lay
their siege, that it would take away all the food of fancy: But even civil
war yesterdaye grew betwixt them and others, who bears the same badge of
Desire: that they do so, as thus bestead they are brought to this fayer pass,
to desire no more, but that this death or overthrow, may be seen^ by those
eyes who are only unhappy, in that they can neither find fellows nor see
them selue^

Which speech being done, the defendants came in, in such order as they came in
the day before, therefore I shall not need to make a new repetition of the
same, since al has been touched already. Then went they to the Tourney, where
they did very Nobly, Greeks and Trojans had dealt their deadly dole, no party
was spared, nor estate expected, but each knight endued to win the golden
fleece, that expected either fame or the favor of his maistresse, which
sport continued all the same day, And toward the evening the sport being
ended, there was a boy sent up to the queen being clothed in Ash colored
garments in taken of humble submission, wh^ having an Olive brauch in his
hand, and falling down prostrate on his face, and then kneeled up, concluded
this noble exercise with these words to her Majesty

Most renoumed Princess of Princess, they will bear in their foreheades, as
their other (...) i^ engraven in their hea^^s: For witness thereof they present
this Olive branch to your presence, in token of your Triumphant peace, And of
their peaceable servitude

Whereby they present themselves as bondmen by those bonds, which the loss
of life, can only loose: Only from out of that which was theirs they crave
thus much, to give so^e token to those knights which may be judged to hauedon
best in each kind of vveapon, or who by his devise has come in best sort in
this desirous strife, this being don, they being now slaves (in whom much
duty requires) for fear of offense, dare say no further, but wish from the
bottom of their captiued hearts, That while this realm is thus fortified and
beautified: Desire may be your (...) adversary

Which speech being ended her majesty gave them al praise and great thanks,
which they esteemed so well and thought themsel^es rewarded according to their
own wishing, And so they departed each (...) in order, according to their first
coming i^

THVS have I (good Reader) according to my s^mple skill set forth this singular
pastime that thou may* being far of? peradventure know more, then they
that were present and eye beholders of the same, which so ^eere as I could
either gather or get, I have for thy pleasure here placed it, If any thing be
wanting which is not here mentioned, or ought awry and not right reported, let
this suffice, that my ^il was good to have gotten all, and most vnwiling to do
ought amiss, yet such as it is if thou well accept it, I shall think my pains
well employed for thy pleasure, and gratified enough with that good will:
Therefore wishing thee to think no worse of my work, then I thought the laber
little in working, craving but P^na verba for my well meaning. I give thee the
friendly Farewell

Thine to command in all courteous manner. HENRY GOLDVVIL.
