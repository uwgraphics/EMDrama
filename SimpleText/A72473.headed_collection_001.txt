Vt sibi praebentem, mimo spectacula plura.
Scriptores autem narrare putaret assello
Fabellam surdo.


LONDON, Printed by I. B. for ROBERT ALLOT, and are to be sold at the sign of
the Bear, in Paul's Churchyard. 1631

YOur Majesty is welcome to a Fair;
Such place, such men, such language and such ware,
You must expect: with these, the zealous noise
Of your lands Faction, scandalized at toys,
As Babies, Hobby-horses, Puppet-playes,
And such like rage, whereof the petulant ways
Your self have known, and have bin vexed with long.
These for your sport, without particular wrong,
Or just complaint of any private man,
(Who of himself, or shall think well or can)
The Maker does present: and hopes, to night
To give you for a Fayring, true delight.
GEntlemen, have a little patience, they are even upon coming, instantly. He
that should begin the Play, Master Littlewit, the Proctor, has a stitch new
fallen in his black silk stocking; 'twill be drawn up ere you can tell twenty.
He plays one of the Arches, that dwells about the Hospital, and he has a very
pretty part. But for the whole Play, will you ha'the truth on it? (I am looking,
lest the Poet hear me, or his man, Master Broom, behind the Arras) it is like
to be a very conceited scuruy one, in plain English. When It comes to the
Fair, once: you were even as good go to Virginia, for any thing there is of
Smith-field. He has not hit the humors, he does not know 'hem; he has not
conuers'd with the Bartholmew-birds, as they say; he has never a Sword, and
Buckler man in his Fair, nor a little Dauy, to take toll of the Bawds there, as
in my time, nor a Kind-heart, if any bodies teeth should chance to ache in his
Play. Nor a Iugler with a wel-educated Ape to come over the chain, for the
King of England, and back again for the Prince, and sit still on his arse for
the Pope, and the King of Spain! None o'these fine sights! Nor has he the
Canuas-cut 'ithe night, for a Hobby-horse-man to creep into his she-neighbour,
and take his leap there! Nothing! No, and some writer (that I know) had had but
the penning of this matter, he would have made you such a Iig-ajogge in the
boothes, you should have thought an earthquake had been in the Fair! But these
Master- Poets, they will have their own absurd courses; they will be informed
of nothing! He has (sirreuerence) kicked me three, or four times about the
Tyring-house, I thank him, for but offering to putt in, with my experience.
I Will be judged by you, Gentlemen, now, but for one conceit of mine! would not a
fine Pumpe upon the Stage have done well, for a property now? and a Punque set
under upon her head, with her Stern upward, and have been sous'd by my wity
young masters of the Innes of Court? what think you of this for a show, now? he
will not hear of this! I am an Ass! I! and yet I kept the Stage in Master
Tarletons time, I thank my stars. Ho! and that man had lived to have played
in Bartholmew Fair, you should have seen him have come in, and have been
coozened in the Cloath-quarter, so finely! And Adams, the Rogue, ha leaped and
caper'd upon him, and have dealt his vermin about, as though they had cost him
nothing. And then a substantial watch to have stolen in upon 'hem, and taken
'hem away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in the Stage-practice

How now? what rare discourse are you fallen upon? ha? have you found any
familiars here, that you are so free? what is the business


Nothing, but the understanding Gentlemen of the ground here, asked my
judgment


Your judgment, Rascal? for what? sweeping the Stage? or gathering up the
broken Apples for the bears within? Away Rogue, it is come to a fine degree in
these spectacles when such a youth as you pretend to a judgment. And yet he
may, in the most of this matter in faith: For the Author has writ it just to his
Meridian, and the Scale of the grounded Judgments here, his Play-fellowes in
wit. Gentlemen; not for want of a Prologue, but by way of a new one, I am sent
out to you here, with a Scriuener, and certain Articles drawn out in have
between our Author, and you; which if you please to hear, and as they appear
reasonable, to approve of; the Play will follow presently. Read, Scribe, gi'me
the Counterpaine


ARTICLES of Agreement, indented, between the Spectators or Hearers, at the
Hope on the Bankeside, in the County of Surrey on the one party; And the Author
of Bartholmew Fair in the said place, and County on the other party: the one
and thirtieth day of October. 1614. and in the twelfth year of the Reign of our
Soueragine Lord, JAMES by the grace of God King of England, France, and
Ireland, Defender of the faith. And of Scotland the seven and fortieth

INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and between the parties above said,
and the said Spectators, and Hearers, as well the curious and envious, as the
favoring and judicious, as also the grounded Judgments and understandings,
do for themselves severally Covenant, and agree to remain in the places,
their money or friends have put them in, with patience, for the space of two
hours and an half, and somewhat more. In which time the Author promises to
present them by us, with a new sufficient Play called BARTHOLMEW FAIR, merry,
and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none.
Provided they have either, the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves

It is further agreed that every person here, have his or their free will of
censure, to like or dislike at their own charge, the Author having now
departed with his right: It shall be lawful for any man to judge his six
pen'orth his twelve pen'orth, so to hiseighteene pence, 2. shillings, half a
crown, to the value of his place: Provided always his place get not above his
wit. And if he pay for half a dozen, he may censure for all them too, so that
he will undertake that they shall be silent. He shall put in for Censures
here, as they do for lots at the lottery: mary if he drop but six pence at
the door, and will censure a crowns worth, it is thought there is no
conscience, or justice in that

It is also agreed, that every man here, exercise his own Judgment, and not
censure by Contagion, or upon trust, from another voice, or face, that sits by
him, be he never so first, in the Commission of Wit: As also, that he be fixed
and settled in his censure, that what he approues, or not approues to day, he
will do the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, and so the next
week (if need be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the Bench
with him, though they indite, and arraigne Plays daily. He that will swear,
Ieronimo, or Andronicus are the best plays, yet, shall pass vnexcepted at,
here, as a man whose Judgment shows it is constant, and has stood still,
these five and twenty, or thirty years. Though it be an Ignorance, it is a
virtuous and stayed ignorance; and next to truth, a confirmed error does well;
such a one the Author knows where to find him

It is further couenanted, concluded and agreed, that how great soever the
expectation be, no person here, is to expect more then he knows, or better
ware then a Fair will afford: neither to look back to the sword and
buckler-age of Smithfield, but content himself with the present. In stead of a
little Dauy, to take toll of the Bawds, the Author does promise a strutting
Horse-courser, with a leerc-Drunkard, two or three to attend him, in as good
Equipage as you would wish. And then for Kinde-heart, the Tooth-drawer, a fine
oily Pig-woman with her Tapster, to bid you welcome, and a consort of Roarers
for music. A wise Justice of Peace meditant, in stead of a Iugler, with an
Ape. A civil Cutpurse searchant. A sweet Singer of new Ballads allurant: and
as fresh an Hypocrite, as ever was broached rampant. If there be never a
Seruant-monster in the Fair; who can help it? he fayes; nor a nest of
Antiques? He is loath to make Nature afraid in his Plays, like those that be
get Tales, Tempests, and such like Drolleries, to mix his head with other men's
heels; let the concupisence of Iigges and Dances, reign as strong as it will
amongst you: yet if the Puppets will please any body, they shall be entreated
to come in

In consideration of which, it is finally agreed, by the foresaid hearers, and
spectators, that they neither in themselves conceal, nor suffer by them to be
concealed any State-decipherer, or politic Picklocke of the Scene, so
solemnly ridiculous, as to search out, who was meant by the Ginger-bread-woman,
who by the Hobby-horse-man, who by the Costard-monger, nay, who by their Wares.
Or that will pretend to affirm (on his own inspired ignorance) what Mirror of
Magistrates is meant by the Justice, what great Lady by the Pigge-woman, what
concealed Statesman, by the Seller of Mouse-trappes, and so of the rest. But
that such person, or persons so found, be left discovered to the mercy of the
Author, as a forfeiture to the Stage, and your laughter, aforesaid. As also,
such as shall so desperately, or ambitiously, play the fool by his place
aforesaid, to challenge the Author of scurrilitie, because the language some
where savors of Smithfield, the Booth, and the Pig-broath, or of
profaneness, because a Madman cries, God quit you, or bless you. In
witness whereof, as you have preposterously put to your Seals already (which
is your money) you will now add the other part of suffrage, your hands, The
Play shall presently begin. And though the Fair be not kept in the same
Region, that some here, perhaps, would have it, yet think, that therein the
Author has observed a special Decorum, the place being as durty as
Smithfield, and as stinking every whit

Howsoever, he prays you to believe, his Ware is still the same, else you
will make him justly suspect that he that is so loath to look on a Baby, or an
Hobbyhorse, here, would be glad to take up a Commodity of them, at any
laughter, or loss, in another place


A Pretty conceit, and worth the finding! I have such luck to spinne out these
fine things still, and like a Silke-worme, out of my self. Here Is Master
Bartholomew Cokes, of Harrow o'th hill, in the County of Middlesex, Esquire,
takes forth his License, to marry Mistress Grace Wel-borne of the said place
and County: and when does he take it forth? to day! the four and twentieth
of August! Bartholmew day! Bartholmew upon Bartholmew! there is the device! who
would have marked such a leap-frogge chance now? A very less then Ames-ace, on
two Dice! well, go thy ways John Little-wit, Proctor John Little-wit: One
of the pretty wits of Paul's, the Little wit of London (so thou art called) and
some thing beside. When a quirk, or a quiblin does escape thee, and thou do
not watch, and apprehend it, and bring it before the Constable of conceit:
(there now, I speak quib too) let'hem carry thee out of the Archdeacons Court,
into his Kitchen, and make a Jack of thee, in stead of a John. (There I am
again la!) Win, Good morrow, Win. I marry Win! Now you look finely indeed,
Win! this Cap does convince! youl'd not have worn it, VVin, nor have had it
velvet, but a rough country Beauer, with a copper-band, like the Conney-skinne
woman of Budge-row? Sweet VVin, let me kiss it! And. her fine high shoes,
like the Spanish Lady! Good VVin, go a little I would feign see thee pace,
pretty VVin! By this fine Cap, I could never leave kissing on it


Come, indeed la, you are such a fool, still!


No, but half a one, Win, you are the the other half: man and wife make one
fool, Win. (Good!) Is there the Proctor, or Doctor indeed, in the Diocese,
that ever had the fortune to win him such a Win! (There I am again!) I do
feel conceits coming upon me, more then I am able to turn tongue too. A
pox of these pretenders, to wit! your Three Cranes, Miter, and Mermaid men!
Not a corn of true salt, nor a grain of right mustard amongst them all. They
may stand for places or so, again the next Wit fall, and pay two pence in a
quart more for their Canary, then other men. But gi' me the man, can start up
a Justice of Wit out of six-shillings bear, and give the law to all the Poets,
and Poet-suckers in Town, because they are the Players Gossips? 'Slid, other
men have wives as fine as the Players, and as well dressed. Come hither, Win


Why, how now Master Little-wit! measuring of lips? or molding of kisses?
which is it


Troth I am a little taken with my Wins dressing here! Do not fine Master
Win-wife? How do you apprehend, Sir? She would not have worn this habit. I
challenge all Cheapside, to show such another: Morefields, Pimlico path, or the
Exchange, in a summer evening, with a Lace to boot as this has. Dear Win, let
Master Win-wife kiss you. He comes a wooing to our mother Win, and may be our
father perhaps, Win. There Is no harm in him, Win


None in the earth, Master Little-wit.


^enuy no man, my delicates, Sir.


Alas, you have the garden where they grow still! A wife here with a
Strawbery-breath, Chery-lips, Apricot-cheekes, and a soft velvet head, like a
Melicotton


Good y' faith! now dullness upon me, that I had not that before him, that I
should not light on it, as well as he! Velvet head


But my taste, Master Little-wit, tends to fruict of a later kind: the sober
Matron, your wives mother


I! we know you are a Suitor, Sir. Win, and I both, wish you well: by this
Licencc here, would you had her, that your two names were as fast in it, as
here are a couple. Win would feign have a fine young father in law, with a
fether: that her mother might hood it, and chain it, with Mistress Ouer-doo.
But, you do not take the right course, Master Win-wife


No? Master Litle-wit, why?


You are not mad enough.


How? Is madness a right course?


I say nothing, but I wink upon Win. You have a friend, one (Master- Quarlous)
comes here some times


Why? he makes no love to her, does he?


Not a token worth that ever I saw, I assure you, But --


What?


He is the more Mad-cap of the two. You do not apprehend me.


You have a hot coal in your mouth, now, you cannot hold.


Let me out with it, dear Win.


I Will tell him my self.


Do, and take all the thanks, and much do good thy pretty heart, Win.


Sir, my mother has had her natiuity-water cast lately by the Cunning men in
Cow-lane, and they have told her her fortune, and do ensure her, shce shall
never have happy hour; unless she marry within this sen'night, and when it
is, it must be a Madde-man, they say


I, but it must be a Gentleman Madman.


Yes, so the the other man of More-fields says.


But does she believe 'hem?


Yes, and has been at Bedlem twice since, every day, to enquire if any
Gentleman be there, or to come there, mad


Why, this is a confederacy, a mere piece of practice upon her, by these
Impostors


I tell her so; or else say I, that they mean some young-Madcap-Gentleman (for
the devil can equivocate, as well as a Shopkeeper) and therefore would I
advise you, to be a little madder, then Master Quarlous, hereafter


Where is she? stirring yet?


Stirring! Yes, and studying an old Elder, come from Banbury, a Suitor that
puts in here at meale-tyde, to praise the painful brethren, or pray that the
sweet singers may be restored; Says a grace as long as his breath lasts him!
Some time the spirit is so strong with him, it gets quite out of him, and then
my mother, or Win, are feign to fetch it again with Malmesey, or Aqua
coelestis


Yes indeed, we have such a tedious life with him for his diet, and his clothes
too, he breaks his buttons, and cracks seames at every saying he sobs out


He cannot abide my Vocation, he says.


No, he told my mother, a Proctor was a claw of the Beast, and that she had
little less then committed abomination in marrying me so as she has done


Every line (he says) that a Proctor writes, when it comes to be read in the
Bishops Court, is a long black hair, kemb'd out of the tail of Antichrist


When came this Proselyte?


Some three days since.


O Sir, have you taken soil, here? it is well, a man may reach you, after 3.
hours running, yet! what an unmerciful companion art thou, to quit thy
lodging, at such ungentle manly hours? None but a scatterd couey of Fiddlers,
or one of these Rag-rakers in dung-hills, or some Marrow-bone man at most,
would have been up, when thou were gone abroad, by all description. I pray
thee what aylest thou, thou can not sleep? have thou Thorns i'thy eyelids,
or Thistles i'thy bed


I cannot tell: It seems you had neither in your feet; that took this pain to
find me


No, and I had, all the Lime-hounds of the City should have drawn after you, by
the sent rather, Mr, John Little-wit! God save you, Sir. 'Twas a hot night with
some of us, last night, John: shall we pluck a hair of the same Wolf, to day,
Proctor John


Do you remember Master Quarlous, what we discourst on, last night?


Not I, John: nothing that I either discourse or do, at those times I forfeit
all to forgetfulness


No? not concerning Win, look you: there she is, and dressed as I told you she
should be: hark you Sir, had you forgot


By this head, I Will beware how I keep you company, John, when I drunk, and
you have this dangerous memory! that is certain


Why Sir?


Why? we were all a little stained last night, sprinkled with a cup or two,
and I agreed with Proctor John here, to come and do somewhat with Win (I know
not what 'twas) to day; and he puts me in mind on it, now; he says he was
coming to fetch me: before Truth, if you have that fearful quality, John, to
remember, when you are sober, John, what you promise drunk, John; I shall take
heed of you, John. For this once, I am content to wink at you, where is your
wife? come hither Win.


Why, John! do you see this, John? look you! help me, John.


O Win, fie, what do you mean, Win! Be womanly, Win; make an outcry to your
mother, Win? Master Quarlous is an honest Gentleman, and our worshipful good
friend, Win: and he is Master Winwifes friends, too: And Master Win-wife comes
a Suitor to your mother Win; as I told you before, Win, and may perhaps, be our
Father, Win, they will do you no harm, Win, they are both our worshipful good
friends. Master Quarlous! you must know Mr. Quarlous, Win; you must not
quarrel with Master Quarlous, VVin


No, we will kiss again and fall in.


Yes, do good Win.


In Faith you are a fool, John.


A Foole-Iohn she calls me, do you mark that, Gentlemen? pretty littlewit of
velvet! a fool- John


She may call you an Apple- John, if you use this.


Pray thee forbear, for my respect somewhat.


Hoy-day! how respective you are become of the sudden! I fear this family will
turn you reformed too, pray you come about again. Because she is in
possibility to be your daughter in law, and may ask you blessing hereafter,
when she courts it to Totnam to eat cream. Well, I will forbear, Sir, but
in faith, would thou would leave thy exercise of widdow-hunting once! this
drawing after an old reverend Smock by the splay-foote: There cannot be an
ancient Tripe or Trillibub in the Town, but thou art straight nosing it, and
it is a fine occupation thou wilt confine thy self to, when thou have got one;
scrubbing a piece of Buffe, as if thou had the perpetuity of Pannyer-alley to
stink in; or perhaps, worse, currying a carcass, that thou have bound thy
self to alive. I Will besworne, some of them, (that thou art, or have been a
Suitor to) are so old, as no chaste or married pleasure can ever become 'hem:
the honest Instrument of procreation, has (forty years since) left to belong
to 'hem, thou must visit 'hem, as thou would do a Tomb, with a Torch, or
three hand-fulls of Lincke, flaming hot, and so thou may hap to make 'hem
feel thee, and after, come to inherit according to thy inches. A sweet course
for a man to waste the brand of life for, to be still raking himself a fortune
in an old woman's embers; we shall have thee after thou have been but a month
married to one of 'hem, look like the quartane ague, and the black Iaundise
met in a face, and walk as if thou had borrowed legs of a Spinner, and
voice of a Cricket. I would endure to hear fifteen Sermons aweeke for her,
and such course, and loud one's, as some of 'hem must be; I would even desire of
Fate, I might dwell in a drum, and take in my sustenance, with an old broken
Tobacco-pipe and a Straw. Do thou ever think to bring thine ears or
stomach, to the patience of a dry grace, as long as thy Tablecloth? and
droan'd out by thy son, here, (that might be thy father;) till all the meat
o'thy board has forgot, it was that day in the Kitchen? Or to brook the noise
made, in a question of Predestination, by the good laborers and painful
eaters, assembled together, put to 'hem by the Matron, your Spouse; who
moderates with a cup of wine, ever and anon, and a Sentence out of Knoxe
between? or the perpetual spitting, before, and after a sober drawn
exhortation of six hours, whose better part was the hune-hahum? Or to hear
prayers groaned out, over thy iron-chests, as if they were charms to break
'hem? And all this for the hope of two Apostle-spoones, to suffer! and a cup to
eat a cawdle in! For that will be thy legacy. She Will have conuey'd her state,
safe enough from thee, an' she be a right widow


Alas, I am quite off that sent now.


How so?


Put off by a Brother of Banbury, one, that, they say, is come here, and
gouernes all, already


What do you call him? I knew diverse of those Banburians when I was in Oxford.


Master Little-wit can tell us.


Sir! good VVin, go in, and if Master Bartholmew Cokes- his man come for the
License: (the little old fellow) let him speak with me; what say you,
Gentlemen


What call you the Reverend Elder? you told me of? your Banbury-man.


Rabbi Busy, Sir, he is more then an Elder, he is a Prophet, Sir.


O, I know him! a Baker, is he not?


He was a Baker, Sir, but he does dream now, and see visions, he has given
over his Trade


I remember that too: out of a scruple he took, that (in spic'd conscience)
those Cakes he made, were served to Bridales, May-poles, Morrisses, and such
profane feasts and meetings; his Christen-name is Zeale-of-the-land


Yes, Sir, Zeale-of-the-land Busye.


How, what a name's there!


O, they have all such names, Sir; he was Witness, for Win, here, (they will
not be called Godfathers) and named her VVinne-the-fight, you thought her name
had been VVinnifred, did you not


I did indeed.


He would have thought himself a stark Reprobate, if it had.


I, for there was a Blew-starch-woman of the name, at the same time. Anotable
hypocritical vermin it is; I know him. One that stands upon his face, more
then his faith, at all times; Ever in seditious motion, and reproving for
vainglory: of a most lunatique conscience, and spleen, and affects the
violence of Singularity in all he does: (He has undone a Grocer here, in
New-gate-market, that broke with him, trusted him with Currants, as errant a
Zeal as he, that is by the way: by his profession, he will ever be in the state
of Innocence, though; and childhood; derides all Antiquity; defies any other
Learning, then Inspiration; and what discretion soever, years should afford
him, it is all prevented in his Original ignorance; have not to do with him:
for he is a fellow of a most arrogant, and invincible dullness, I assure you;
who is this


BY your leave, Gentlemen, with all my heart to you: and god you good morrow;
Mr Little-wit, my business is to you. Is this License ready


Here, I have it for you, in my hand, Master Humphrey.


That Is well, nay, never open, or read it to me, it is labor in vain, you
know. I am no Clearke, I scorn to be saved by my book, in faith I Will hang
first; fold it up o'your word and gi' it me; what must you have for it


We'll talk of that anon, Master Humphrey.


Now, or not at all, good Mr Proctor, I am for no anon's, I assure you.


Sweet VVin, bid Solomon send me the little black box within, in my study.


I, quickly, good Mistress, I pray you: for I have both eggs of the Spit, and
iron in the fire, say, what you must have, good Mr Little-wit


Why, you know the price, Mr Numps.


I know? I know nothing. I, what tell you me of knowing? (now I am in have)
Sir, I do not know, and I will not know, and I scorn to know, and yet, (now I
think on it) I will, and do know, as well as another; you must have a Mark for
your thing here, and eight pence for the box; I could have saved two pence
i'that, an' I had bought it my self, but here is fourteen shillings for you.
Good Lord! how long your little wife stays! pray God, Solomon, your Clerk, be
not looking in the wrong box, Mr Proctor


Good in faith! no, I warrant you, Solomon is wiser then so, Sir.


Fie, fie, fie, by your leave Master Little-wit, this is scuruy, idle, foolish
and abominable, with all my heart; I do not like it


Do you hear? Jack Little-wit, what business does thy pretty head think,
this fellow may have, that he keeps such a coil with


More then buying of ginger-bread in the Cloister, here, (for that we allow
him) or a guilt pouch in the Fair


Master Quarlous, do not mistake him: he is his Masters both-hands, I assure
you


What? to pull on his boots, a mornings, or his stockings, does he?


Sir, if you have a mind to mock him, mock him softly, and look to'ther
way: for if he apprehend you flout him, once, he will fly at you presently. A
terrible testie old fellow, and his name is Waspe too


Pretty Insect! make much on him.


A plague of this box, and the pox too, and on him that made it, and her that
went for it, and all that should have sought it, sent it, or brought it! do you
see, Sir


Nay, good Mr Waspe.


Good Master Hornet, turd in your teeth, hold you your tongue; do not I know
you? your father was a Pothecary, and sold glisters, more then he gave, I
wusse: and turd in your little wives teeth too (here she come) 'twill make her
spit as fine as she is, for all her veluet-custerd on her head, Sir


O! be civil Master Numpes.


Why, say I have a humor not to be civil; how then? who shall compel me? you?


Here is the box, now.


Why a pox o'your box, once again: let your little wife stale in it, and she
will. Sir, I would have you to understand, and these Gentlemen too, if they
please --


With all our hearts. Sir.


That I have a charge. Gentlemen.


They do apprehend, Sir.


Pardon me, Sir, neither they nor you, can apprehend me, yet. (you are an
Ass) I have a young Master, he is now upon his making and marring; the whole
care of his well doing, is now mine. His foolish scholemasters have done
nothing, but run up and down the Country with him, to beg puddings, and
cake-bread, of his tennants, and almost spoiled him, he has learned nothing,
but to sing catches, and repeat rattle bladder rattle, and O, Madge. I dare not
let him walk alone, for fear of learning of vise tunes, which he will sing
at supper, and in the sermon-times! if he meet but a Carman in the street,
and I find him not talk to keep him off on him, he will whistle him, and
all his tunes over, at night in his sleep! he has a head full of Bees! I am
feign now (for this little time I am absent) to leave him in charge with a
Gentlewoman; It Is true, she is A Justice of Peace his wife, and a Gentlewoman
of the hood, and his natural sister: But what may happen, under a woman's
government, there is the doubt. Gentlemen, you do not know him: he is another
manner of piece then you think for! but nineteen year old, and yet he is
taller then either of you, by the head, God bless him


Well, me thinks, this is a fine fellow!


He has made his Master a finer by this description, I should think.


'Faith, much about one, it is cross and pile, whether for a new farthing.


I Will tell you Gentlemen --


Will It please you drink, Master VVaspe?


Why, I have not talk 't so long to be dry, Sir, you see no dust or cobwebs
come out of my mouth: do you? you would have me gone, would you


No, but you were in have even now, Mr Numpes.


What an' I were? so I am still, and yet I will stay too; meddle you with your
match, your Win, there, she has as little wit, as her husband it seems: I have
others to talk to


She Is my match indeed, and as little wit as I, Good!


We have bin but a day and a half in town, Gentlemen, it is true; and yester
day in the afternoon, we walked London, to show the City to the Gentlewoman, he
shall marry, Mistress Grace; but, before I will endure such another half day,
with him, I Will be drawn with a good Gib-cat, through the great pond at home,
as his uncle Hodge was! why, we could not meet that heathen thing, all day, but
stayed him: he would name you all the Signs over, as he went, aloud: and where
he spied a Parrat, or a Monkey, there he was pitched, with all the
littl-long-coats about him, male and female; no getting him away! I thought he
would have run mad of the black boy in Bucklers-bury, that takes the scury,
roguy tobacco, there


You say true, Master Numpes: there is such a one indeed.


It Is no matter, whether there be, or no, what is that to you?


He will not allow of John's reading at any hand,


O Numpes! are you here Numpes? look where I am, Numpes! and Mistress Grace,
too! nay, do not look angerly, Numpes: my Sister is here, and all, I do not
come without her


What, the mischief, do you come with her? or she with you?


We came all to seek you, Numpes.


To seek me? why, did you all think I was lost? or run away with your
fourteen shillings worth of small ware, here? or that I had changed it in the
Fair, for hobby-horses? S'pretious -- to seek me


Nay, good Mr Numpes, do you show discretion, though he be exorbitant, (as Mr
Over do says,) and't be but for conservation of the peace


Mary gip, goody she- Justice, Mistress French-hood! turd in your teeth; and turd
in your French-hoods teeth, too, to do you service, do you see? must you quote
your Adam to me! you think, you are Madam Regent still, Mistress Ouer-doo; when
I am in place? no such matter, I assure you, your reign is out, when I am in,
Dame


I am content to be in abeyance, Sir, and be governed by you; so should he
too, if he did well; but 'twill be expected, you should also govern your
passions


Will It so forsooth? good Lord! how sharp you are! with being at Bet'lem
yesterday? VVhetston has set an edge upon you, has he


Nay, if you know not what belongs to your dignity: I do, yet, to mine.


Very well, then.


Is this the License, Numpes? for Loves sake, let me see it. I never saw a
License


Did you not so? why, you shall not see it, then.


An' you love me, good Numpes.


Sir, I love you, and yet I do not love you, i'these fooleries, set your heart
at rest; there is nothing in it, but hard words: and what would you see it for


I would see the length and the breadth on it, that is all; and I will see it now,
so I will


You sha' not see it, here.


Then I Will see it at home, and I Will look vpo' the case here.


Why, do so, a man must give way to him a little in trifles: Gentlemen. These
are errors, diseases of youth: which he will mend, when he comes to judgment,
and knowledge of matters. I pray you conceive so, and I thank you. And I play
you pardon him, and I thank you again


Well, this dry-nurse, I say still, is a delicate man.


And I, am, for the Cosset, his charge! Did you ever see a fellows face more
accuse him for an Ass


Accuse him? it confesses him one without accusing. What pity it is yonder
wench should marry such a Cokes


It Is true.


She seems to be discreet, and as sober as she is handsome.


I, and if you mark her, what a restrained scorn she casts upon all his
behavior, and speeches


Well, Numpes, I am now for another piece of business more, the Fair, Numpes,
and then --


Bless me! deliver me, help, hold me! the Fair!


Nay, never fidge up and down, Numpes, and vex it self. I am resolute
Bartholmew, in this; I Will make no suite on it to you; 'twas all the end of my
journey, indeed, to show Mistress Grace my Fair: I called my Fair, because of
Bartholmew: you know my name is Bartholmew, and Bartholmew Fair


That was mine before, Gentlemen: this morning. I had that in faith, upon his
License, believe me, there he comes, after me


Come, John, this ambitious wit of yours, (I am afraid) will do you no good
in the end


No? why Sir?


You grow so insolent with it, and ouerdoing, John: that if you look not to
it, and tie it up, it will bring you to some obscure place in time, and there
'twill leave you


Do not trust it too much, John, be more sparing, and use it, but now and
then; a wit is a dangerous thing, in this age; do not over buy it


Think you so, Gentlemen? I Will take heed on it, hereafter.


Yes, do John.


A pretty little soul, this same Mistress Little-wit! would I might marry her.


So would I, or any body else, so I might escape you,


Numps, I will see it, Numpes, it is decreed: never be melancholy for the matter.


Why, see it, Sir, see it, do see it! who hinders you? why do you not go see
it? 'Slid see it


The Fair, Numps, the Fair.


World the Fair and all the Drums, and Rattles in it, were in your belly for
me: they are already in your brain: he that had the means to travel you
head, now, should meet finer sights then any are in the Fair; and make a finer
voyage on it; to see it all hung with cockle-shels, pebbles, fine wheat-strawes,
and here and there a chicken's feather, and a cob-web


Good faith, he looks, me thinks an' you mark him, like one that were made
to catch flies, with his Sir Cranion-legs


And his Numpes, to flap 'hem away.


God, bew' you, Sir, there is your Be in a box, and much good do it, you.


Why, your friend, and Bartholmew; an' you be so contumacious.


What mean you, Numpes?


I Will not be guilty, I, Gentlemen.


You will not let him go, Brother, and loose him?


Who can hold that will away? I had rather loose him then the Fair, I wusse.


You do not know the inconvenience, Gentlemen, you persuade to: nor what
trouble I have with him in these humors. If he go to the Fair, he will buy
of every thing, to a Baby there; and household stuff for that too. If a leg
or an arm on him did not grow on, he would lose it in the press. Pray heaven
I bring him off with one stone! And then he is such a Rauener after fruit! you
will not believe what a coil I had, the other day, to compound a business
between a Katerne-peare-woman, and him, about snatching! it is intolerable,
Gentlemen


O! but you must not leave him, now, to these hazards, Numpes.


Nay, he knows too well, I will not leave him, and that makes him presume:
well, Sir, will you go now? if you have such an itch in your feet, to foot it
to the Fair, why do you stop, am I your Tarriars? go, will you go? Sir, why
do you not go


O Numps! have I brought you about? come Mistress Grace, and Sister, I am
resolute Batt, in faith, still


Truly, I have no such fancy to the Fair; nor ambition to see it; there is
none goes thither of any quality or fashion


O Lord, Sir! you shall pardon me, Mistress Grace, we are inow of our selves to
make it a fashion: and for qualities, let Numps alone, he will find qualities


What a Rogue in apprehension is this! to understand her language no better.


I, and offer to marry to her? well, I will leave the chase of my widow, for
to day, and directly to the Fair. These flies cannot, this hot season, but
engender us excellent creeping sport


A man that has but a spoone full of brain, would think so. Farewell, John.


Win, you see, it is in fashion, to go to the Fair, Win: we must to the Fair
too, you, and I, Win. I have an affair in the Fair, Win, a Puppet-play of mine
own making, say nothing, that I writ for the motion man, which you must see,
Win


I would I might John, but my mother will never consent to such a profane
motion: she will call it


Tut, we'll have a device, a dainty one; (Now, Wit, help at a pinch, good Wit
come, come, good Wit, and 't be thy will.) I have it, Win, I have it 'ifaith,
and it is a fine one. Win, long to eat of a Pigge, sweet Win, in the Fair; do
you see? in the heart of the Fair; not at Pye-Corner. Your mother will do any
thing, Win, to satisfy your longing, you know, pray thee long, presently, and
be sick of the sudden, good Win. I Will go in and tell her, cut thy lace in the
mean time, and play the Hypocrite, sweet Win


No, I Will not make me unready for it. I can be Hypocrite enough, though I were
never so straight laced


You say true, you have bin bred in the family, and brought up to it. Our mother
is a most elect Hypocrite, and has maintained us all this seven year with it,
like Gentle-folkes


I, Let her alone, John, she is not a wise wilful widow for nothing, nor a
sanctified sister for a song. And let me alone too, I have somewhat of the mother
in me, you shall see, fetch her, fetch her, ah, ah


NOw, the blaze of the beauteous discipline, fright away this evil from our
house! how now Win-the-fight, Child: how do you? Sweet child, speak to me


Yes, forsooth.


Look up, sweet Win-the-fight, and suffer not the enemy to enter you at this
door, remember that your education has bin with the purest, what polluted one
was it, that named first the unclean beast, Pigge, to you, Child


(Vh, vh.)


Not I, of my sincerity, mother: she longed above three hours, ere she would
let me know it; who was it Win


A profane black thing with a beard, John.


O! resist it, Win-the-fight, it is the Tempter, the wicked Tempter, you may
know it by the fleshly motion of Pig, be strong against it, and it is foul
temptations, in these assaults, whereby it broacheth flesh and blood, as it
were, on the weaker side, and pray against it is carnal prouocations, good
child, sweet child, pray


Good mother, I pray you; that she may eat some Pigge, and her belly full,
too; and do not you cast away your own child, and perhaps one of mine, with
your tale of the Tempter: how do you, Win? Are you not sick


Yes, a great deal, John, (vh, vh.)


What shall we do? call our zealous brother Busy hither, for his faithful
fortification in this charge of the adversary; child, my dear child, you
shall eat Pigge, be comforted, my sweet child


I, but in the Fair, mother.


I mean in the Fair, if it can be any way made, or found lawful; where is our
brother Busy? Will he not come? look up, child


Presently, mother, as soon as he has cleans'd his beard. I found him, fast by
the teeth, in the cold Turkey-pye, in the cupbord, with a great white loaf on
his left hand, and a glass of Malmesey on his right


Slander not the Brethren, wicked one.


Here he is, DO^, purified, Mother.


O brother Busy^ your help here to edify, and raise us up in a scruple; my
daughter Win-the-fight is visited with a natural disease of women; called, A
longing to eat Pigge


I Sir, a Bartholmew-pigge: and in the Fair.


And I would be satisfied from you, Religiously-wise, whether a widow of the
sanctified assembly, or a widows daughter, may commit the act, without
offense to the weaker sisters


Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a carnal disease, or
appetite, incident to women: and as it is carnal, and incident, it is
natural, very natural: Now Pigge, it is a meat, and a meat that is
nourishing, and may be longed for, and so consequently eaten; it may be eaten;
very exceeding well eaten: but in the Fair, and as a Bartholmew-pig, it cannot
be eaten, for the very calling it a Bartholmew-pigge, and to eat it so, is a
spice of Idolatry, and you make the Fair, no better then one of the high
Places. This I take it, is the state of the question. A high place


I, but in state of necessity: Place should give place, Mr Busy, (I have a
conceit left, yet.


Good Brother, Zeale-of-the-land, think to make it as lawful as you can.


Yes Sir, and as soon as you can: for it must be Sir; you see the danger my
little wife is in, Sir


Truly, I do love my child dearly, and I would not have her miscarry, or
hazard her first fruits, if it might be otherwise


Surely, it may be otherwise, but it is subject, to construction, subject, and
has a face of offense, with the weak, a great face, a foul face, but that
face may have a veil put over it, and be shaddowed, as it were, it may be
eaten, and in the Fair, I take it, in a Booth, the tents of the wicked: the
place is not much, not very much, we may be religious in midst of the profane,
so it be eaten with a reformed mouth, with sobriety, and humbleness; not
gorged in with gluttony, or greediness; there is the fear: for, should she go
there, as taking pride in the place, or delight in the unclean dressing, to
feed the vanity of the eye, or the lust of the palate, it were not well, it were
not fit, it were abominable, and not good


Nay, I knew that before, and told her on it, but courage, Win, we'll be humble
enough; we'll seek out the homeliest Booth in the Fair, that is certain,
rather then fail, we will eat it of the ground


I, and I Will go with you my self, Win-the-fight, and my brother,
Zeale-of-the-land, shall go with us too, for our better consolation


Vh, vh.


I, and Solomon too, Win, (the more the merrier) Win, we'll leave Rabby Busy in
a Booth. Solomon, my cloak


Here, Sir.


In the way of comfort to the weak, I will go, and eat. I will eat
exceedingly, and prophecy; there may be a good use made of it, too, now I
think on it: by the public eating of Swines flesh, to profess our hate, and
loathing of Iudaisme, whereof the brethren stand taxed. I will therefore eat,
yea, I will eat exceedingly


Good, in faith, I will eat heartily too, because I will be no Jew, I could
never away with that stiffenecked generation: and truly, I hope my little one
will be like me, that cries for Pigge so, in the mothers belly


Very likely, exceeding likely, very exceeding likely.


WEll, in Justice name, and the Kings; and for the commonwealth! defy all the
world, Adam Ouerdoo, for a disguise, and all story; for thou have fitted thy
self, I swear; feign would I meet the Linceus now, that Eagles eye, that
peircing Epidaurian serpent (as my Quint. Horace cal's him) that could discover
a Justice of Peace, (and lately of the Quorum) under this covering. They may
have seen many a fool in the habit of a Justice; but never till now, a
Justice in the habit of a fool. Thus must we do, though, that wake for the
public good: and thus has the wise Magistrate done in all ages. There is a
doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found. Never shall I enough commend
a worthy worshipful man, sometime a capital member of this City, for his high
wisdom, in this point, who would take you, now the habit of a Porter; now of a
Carman; now of the Dog-killer, in this month of August; and in the winter, of
a Seller of tinder-boxes; and what would he do in all these shapes? mary go
you into every Alehouse, and down into every Celler; measure the length of
puddings, take the gage of black pots, and cannes, I, and custards with a
stick; and their circumference, with a third; weigh the loaves of bread on his
middle-finger; then would he send for 'hem, home; give the puddings to the
poor, the bread to the hungry, the custards to his children; break the pots,
and burn the cannes, himself; he Would not trust his corrupt officers; he
would do it himself. would all men in authority would follow this worthy
president! For (alas) as we are public persons, what do we know? nay, what
can we know? we hear with other men's ears; we see with other men's eyes? a
foolish Constable, or a sleepy Watchman, is all our information, he slanders a
Gentleman, by the virtue of his place, (as he calls it) and we by the vice of
ours, must believe him. As a while agone, they made me, yea me, to mistake an
honest zealous Pursiuant, for a Seminary: and a proper young Batcheler of
Music, for a Bawd. This we are subject to, that live in high place, all our
intelligence is idle, and most of our intelligencers, knaves: and by your
leave, ourselves, thought little better, if not errant fools, for believing
'hem. I Adam Ouerdoo, am resolved therefore, to spare spy-money hereafter, and
make mine own discoueries. Many are the yearly enormities of of this Fair,
in whose courts of Pye-pouldres I have had the honor during the three days
sometimes to sit as Judge. But this is the special day for detection of those
foresaid enormities. Here is my black book, for the purpose; this the cloud
that hides me: under this covert I shall see, and not be seen. On Iunius
Brutus. And as I began, so I Will end: in Justice name, and the Kings; and for
the Commonwealth

THe Fayre's pestlence dead, me thinks; people come not abroad, to day, what
ever the matter is. Do you hear, Sister Trash, Lady of the Basket? sit farther
with your ginger-bread-progeny there, and hinder not the prospect of my shop,
or I Will have it proclaimed in the Fair, what stuff they are made on


Why, what stuff are they made on, Brother Leatherhead? nothing but what is
wholesome, I assure you


Yes, stale bread, rotten eggs, musty ginger, and dead honey, you know.


I! have I met with enormity, so soon?


I shall mar your market, old Ione.


Mar my market, thou too-proud Peddler? do thy worst; I defy thee, I, and thy
stable of hobby-horses. I pay for my ground, as well as thou do, and thou
wrong'st me for all thou art parcell-poet, and an Inginer. I Will find a friend
shall right me, and make a ballad of thee, and thy cattle all over. Are you
pust up with the pride of your wares? your Arsedine


Go to, old Ione, I Will talk with you anon* and take you down too, before
Justice Ouerdoo, he is the man must charm you, I Will have you in the Piepouldres


Charm me? I Will meet thee face to face, before his worship, when thou dare:
and though I be a little crooked of my body, I Will be found as upright in my
dealing, as any woman in Smithfield, I, charm me


I am glad, to hear, my name is their terror, yet, this is doing of Justice.


What do you lack? what is it you buy? what do you lack? Rattles, Drums,
Halberts, Horses, Babies of the best? Fiddles o'th finest?


Buy any pears, pears, fine, very fine pears.


Buy any ginger-bread, guilt ginger-bread!


Hey, now the Fayre's a filling!
O, for a Tune to startle
The Birds of the Booths here billing;
Yearly with old Saint Barthle!
The Drunkards they are wading,
The Punques, and Chapmen trading;
Who'ld see the Fair without his lading? Buy any ballads; new ballads?


Fie upon it: who would wear out their youth, and prime thus, in roasting of
pigges, that had any cooler vocation? Hell's a kind of cold cellar to it, a very
fine vault, of my conscience! what Moone-calfe


Here. Mistress.


How now Vrsla? in a heat, in a heat?


My chair, you false faucet you; and my mornings draught, quickly, a botle of
Ale, to quench me, Rascal. I am all fire, and fat, Nightingale, I shall even
melt away to the first woman, a ribbe again, I am afraid. I do water the
ground in knots, as I go, like a great Garden-pot, you may follow me by the
S.S.s. I make


Alas, good Vr's; was Zekiel here this morning?


Zekiel? what Zekiel?


Zekiel Edgeworth, the civil cutpurse, you know him well enough; he that
talks bawdy to you still: I call him my Secretary


He promised to be here this morning. I remember.


When he comes, bid him stay: I Will be back again presently.


Nightingale, come, Sir, set it here, did not I bid you should get this chair
let out of the sides, for me, that my hips might play? you will never think of
any thing, till your dame be rumpgall'd; it is well, Changeling: because it can
take in your Grasse-hoppers thighs, you care for no more. Now, you look as
you had been in the corner of the Booth, fleaing your breech, with a candles
end, and set fire of the Fair. Fill, Stote: fill


This Pig-woman do I know, and I will put her in, for my second enormity, she
has been before me, Punke, Pinnace and Bawd, any time these two and twenty
years, upon record in the Pie-poudres


Fill again, you unlucky vermin.


'Pray you be not angry, Mistress, I Will have it widen'd anon.


No, no, I shall even dwindle away to 't, ere the Fair be done, you think,
now you have heated me? A poor vexed thing I am, I feel my self dropping
already, as fast as I can: two stone a sewet aday is my proportion: I can but
hold life and soul together, with this (here is to you, Nightingale) and a
whiffe of tobacco, at most. Where Is my pipe now? not filled? thou errant
Incubee


Nay, Vrsla, thou wilt gall between the tongue and the teeth, with fretting, now.


How can I hope, that ever he will discharge his place of trust, Tapster, a man
of reckoning under me, that remembers nothing I say to him? but look to it,
sirrah, you were best, three pence a pipe full, I will have made, of all my
whole half pound of tobacco, and a quarter of a pound of Coltsfoot, mixed with
it too, to itch it out. I that have dealt so long in the fire, will not be to
seek in smoke, now. Then 6. and 20. shillings a barrel I will advance of my
Beer; and fifty shillings a hundred of my bottle-ale, I have told you the ways
how to raise it. Froth your cannes well in the filling, at length Rogue, and
iogge your bottles of the buttocke, Sirrah, then skinke out the first glass,
ever, and drink with all companies, though you be sure to be drunk; you will
mis-reckon the better, and be less ashamed on it. But your true trick,
Rascal, must be, to be ever busy, and mis-take away the bottles and cannes,
in have, before they be half drunk off, and never hear any body call, (if
they should chance to mark you) till you have brought fresh, and be able to for
swear 'hem. Give me a drink of Ale


This is the very womb, and bed of enormitie! gross, as her self! this
must all down for enormity, all, every whit on it


Look, who is there, Sirrah?


O Tempora! O mores! I would not have lost my discovery of this one grieuance,
for my place, and worship of the Bench, how is the poor subject abused, here!
well, I will fall in with her, and with her Moone-calfe, and win out wonders
of enormity. By thy leave, goodly woman, and the fatnessc of the Fair: oily as
the Kings constables Lamp, and shining as his Shooing-horne! has thy Ale
virtue, or thy Beer strength? that the tongue of man may be tickled? and his
palate pleased in the morning? let thy pretty Nephew here, go search and see


What new Roarer is this?


O Lord! do you not know him, Mistress, it is mad Arthur of Bradley, that makes
the Orations. Brave Master, old Arthur of Bradley, how do you? welcome to the
Fair, when shall we hear you again, to handle your matters? with your back
again a Booth, ha? I have bin one o'your little disciples, i'my days


Let me drink, boy, with my love, thy Aunt, here; that I may be eloquent: but
of thy best, lest it be bitter in my mouth, and my words fall foul on the
Fair


Why do thou not fetch him drink? and offer him to sit?


Is It Ale, or Beer? Master Arthur?


Thy best, pretty stripling, thy best; the same thy Dove drinks, and thou
drawest on holy days


Bring him a six penny bottle of Ale; they say, a fools handsell is lucky.


Bring both, child. Ale for Arthur, and Beer for Bradley. Ale for thine Aunt,
boy. My disguise takes to the very wish, and reach of it. I shall by the
benefit of this, discover enough, and more: and yet get off with the reputation
of what I would be. A certain midling thing, between a fool and a madman


What! my little lean Vrsla! my shee-Beare! art thou alive yet? with thy
litter of pigges, to grunt out another Bartholmew Fair? ha


Yes, and to amble a foot, when the Fair is done, to hear you groan out of
a cart, up the heavy hill


Of Holbourne, Vrsla, meanst thou so? for what? for what, pretty Vrs?


For cutting halfe-penny purses: or stealing little penny dogs, out of the
Fair


O! good words, good words Vrs.


Another special enormitie. A cutpurse of the sword! the boot, and the
feather! those are his marks


You are one of those horsleaches, that gave out I was dead, in Turne-bull
street, of a surfeit of botle ale, and tripes


No, 'twas better meat Vrs: cowes vdders; cowes vdders!


Well, I shall be meet with your mumbling mouth one day.


What? thou wilt poison me with a neuft in a bottle of Ale, will it thou? or a
spider in a tobacco-pipe, Vrs? Come, there is no malice in these fat folks, I
never fear thee, and I can escape thy lean Moonecalfe here. Let Us drink it
out, good Vrs, and no vapors


Do thou hear, boy? (there is for thy Ale, and the remnant for thee) speak
in thy faith of a faucet, now; is this goodly person before us here, this
vapors, a knight of the knife


What mean you by that, Master Arthur?


I mean a child of the horne-thumb, a babe of booty, boy; a cutpurse.


O Lord, Sir! far from it. This is Master Dan. Knockhum: Iordane the Ranger of
Turnebull. He is a horse-courser, Sir


Thy dainty dame, though, called him cutpurse.


Like enough, Sir, she will do forty such things in an hour (an you listen to
her) for her recreation, if the toy take her in the greasy kerchiefe: it makes
her fat you see. She battens with it


Here might I have been deceived, now: and have put a fools blot upon my self,
if I had not played an after game of discretion


Alas poor Vrs, this's an ill season for thee.


Hang your self, Hacney-man.


How? how? Vrs, vapors! motion breed vapors?


Vapors? Never tuske, nor twirle your dibble, good Iordane, I know what you will
take to a very drop. Though you be Captain of the Roarers, and fight well at
the case of pis-pots, you shall not fright me with your Lyon-chap, Sir, nor
your tuskes, you angry? you are hungry: come, a pigs head will stop your mouth,
and stay your stomach, at all times


Thou art such another mad merry Vrs still! Troth I do make conscience of
vexing thee, now in the dog-daies, this hot weather, for fear of foundring thee
in the body; and melting down a Pillar of the Fair. Pray thee take thy chair
again, and keep state; and let us have a fresh bottle of Ale, and a pipe of
tobacco; and no vapors. I Will have this belly o'thine taken up, and thy grass
scoured, wench; look! here is EZechiel Edgworth; a fine boy of his inches, as
any is in the Fair! has still money in his purse, and will pay all, with a kind
heart; and good vapors


THat I will, indeed, willingly, Master Knockhum, fetch some Ale, and Tobacco.


What do you lack, Gentlemen? Maid: see a fine hobby horse for your young
Master; cost you but a token a week his prouander


Have you any corns 'iyour feet, and toes?


Buy a Mouse-trap, a Mouse-trap, or a Tormentor for a Flea.


Buy some Ginger-bread.


Ballads, Ballads! fine new ballads:
Hear for your love, and buy for your money.
A delicate ballad of the Ferret and the Coney.
A preservative again' the Punques evil.
Another of Goose-greene-starch, and the Devil.
A dozen of divine points, and the Godly garters.
The Fairing of good council, of an ell and three quarters. What is it you buy?
The Windmill blown down by the witches fart!
Or Saint George, that O! did break the Dragons heart!

Master Nightingale, come hither, leave your mart a little.


O my Secretary! what says my Secretary?


Child of the bottles, what is he? what he?


A civil young Gentleman, Master Arthur, that keeps company with the Roarers,
and disburses all, still. He has ever money in his purse; He pays for them;
and they roar for him: one does good offices for another. They call him the
Secretary, but he serves no body. A great friend of the Ballad-mans they are
never asunder


What pity it is, so civil a young man should haunt this debaucht company?
here is the bane of the youth of our time apparent. A proper penman, I see it in
his countenance, he has a good Clerks look with him, and I warrant him a
quick hand


A very quick hand, Sir.


All the purses, and purchase, I give you to day by conueyance, bring hither to
Vrsla's presently. Fair, when you sing Nightingale


I, near the fullest passages; and shift 'hem often.


And in your singing, you must use your hawks eye nimbly, and fly the purse to
a mark, still, where it is worn, and of which side; that you may gi' me the
sign with your beak, or hang your head that way in the tune


Enough, talk no more on it: your friendship (Masters) is not now to begin.
Drink your draught of Indenture, your sup of Covenant, and away, the Fair
fills apace, company begins to come in, and I have never a Pigge ready, yet


Well said! fill the cups, and light the tobacco: let us give fire in the works,
and noble vapors


And shall we have smockes Vrsla, and good whimsies, ha?


Come, you are in your bawdy vain! the best the Fair will afford, Zekiel, if
Bawd Whit keep his word; how do the Pigges, Moone-calfe


Very passionate, Mistress, on on 'hem has wept out an eye. Master Arthur of
Bradley is melancholy, here, no body talks to him. Will you any tobacco
Master Arthur


No, boy, let my meditations alone.


He Is studying for an Oration, now.


If I can, with this days travel; and all my policy, but rescue this youth,
here out of the hands of the lewd man, and the strange woman. I will sit down
at night; and say with my friend Ovid, Iamque opus exegi, quod nec Pouis ira,
nec ignis, etc


Here Zekiel; here is a health to Vrsla, and a kind vapor, thou have money
i'thy purse still; and store! how do thou come by it? Pray thee vapor thy
friends some in a courteous vapor


Half I have, Master Dan. Knockhum, is always at your service,


Ha, sweet nature! what Goshawke would prey upon such a Lamb?


Let Us see, what it is, Zekiel! count it, come, fill him to pledge me.


We are here before 'hem, me thinks.


All the better, we shall see 'hem come in now.


What do you lack, Gentlemen, what is it you lack? a fine Horse? a Lion? a
Bull? a Bear? a Dog, or a Cat? an excellent fine Bartholmew-bird? or an
Instrument? what is it you lack


S'lid! here is Orpheus among the beasts, with his Fiddle, and all!


Will you buy any comfortable bread, Gentlemen?


And Ceres selling her daughters picture, in Ginger-worke!


That these people should be so ignorant to think us chapmen for 'hem! do we
look as if we would buy Ginger-bread? or Hobby-horses


Why, they know no better ware then they have, nor better customers then come.
And our very being here makes us fit to be demanded, as well as others. Would
Cokes would come! there were a true customer for 'hem


How much is it? thirty shillings? who is yonder! Ned Winwife? and Tom Quarlous,
I think! yes, (gi' me it all) (gi' me it all) Master Win-wife! Master
Quarlous! will you take a pipe of tobacco with us? do not discredit me now,
Zekiel


Do not see him! he is the roaring horse-courser, pray thee let us avoid him:
turn down this way


S'lud, I Will see him, and roar with him, too, and he roared as loud as
Neptune, pray thee go with me


You may draw me to as likely an inconvenience, when you please, as this.


Go to then, come along, we have nothing to do, man, but to see sights, now.


Welcome Master Quarlous, and Master Winwife! will you take any froth, and
smoke with us


Yes, Sir, but you will pardon us, if we knew not of so much familiarity between
us before


As what, Sir?


To be so lightly invited to smoke, and froth.


A good vapor! will you sit down, Sir? this is old Vrsla's mansion, how like
you her bower? here you may have your Punque, and your Pigge in state, Sir,
both piping hot


I had rather have my Punque, cold, Sir.


There Is for me, Punque! and Pigge!


What Moonecalfe? you Rogue.


By and by, the bottle is almost off Mistress, here Master Arthur.


I Will part you, and your play-fellow there, in the guarded coat, an' you sunder
not the sooner


Master Win-wife, you are proud (me thinks) you do not talk, nor drink, are
you proud


Not of the company I am in, Sir, nor the place, I assure you.


You do not except at the company! do you? are you in vapors, Sir?


Nay, good Master Dan: Knockhum, respect my Mistress Bower, as you call it; for
the honor of our Booth, none o'your vapors, here


Why, you thin lean Polcat you, and they have a mind to be i'their vapors,
must you hinder 'hem? what did you know Vermin, if they would have lost a
cloak, or such a triflle?


Good Mistress, 'twas in the behalf of your Booth's credit, that I spoke.


Why? would my Booth have broake, if they had fal'ne out in it? Sir? or would
their heat have fired it? in, you Rogue, and wipe the pigges, and mend the
fire, that they fall not, or I Will both baste and roast you, till your eyes drop
out, like 'hem. (Leave the bottle behind you, and be cursed a while.


Body of the Fair! what is this? mother of the Bawds?


No, she is mother of the Pigs, Sir, mother of the Pigs!


Mother of the Furies, I think, by her firebrand.


Nay, she is too fat to be a Fury, sure, some walking Sow of tallow!


An inspired vessel of Kitchin-stuffe!


She Will make excellent geere for the Coach-makers,


I, I, Gamesters, mock a plain plumpe soft wench of the Suburbs, do, because
she is iuicy and wholesome: you must have your thin pinched ware, pent up in the
compass of a dogge-collar, (or 'twill not do) that looks like a long laced
Conger, set upright, and a green feather, like fennel in the Ioll on it


Well said Vrs, my good Vrs; to 'hem Vrs.


Is she your quagmire, Dan: Knockhum? is this your Bogge?


We shall have a quarrel presently.


How? Bog? Quagmire? foul vapors! hum'h!


Yes, he that would venture for it, I assure him, might sink into her, and be
drowned a week, ere any friend he had, could find where he were


And then he would be a fort' night weighing up again.


'Twere like falling into a whole Shire of butter: they had need be a teeme of
Dutchmen, should draw him out


Answer 'hem, Vrs, where is thy Bartholmew-wit, now? Vrs, thy Bartholmew-wit?


Hang 'hem, rotten, roguy Cheaters, I hope to see 'hem plagued one day (pox'd
they are already, I am sure) with lean playhouse poultry, that has the boany
rumpe, sticking out like the Ace of Spades, or the point of a Partizan, that
every rib of hem is like the tooth of a Saw: and will so grate 'hem with their
hips, and shoulders, as (take 'hem altogether) they were as good lie with a
hurdle


Out upon her, how she drips! she is able to give a man the sweating Sickness,
with looking on her


Mary look off, with a patch o'your face; and a dosen in your breech, though
they be o'scarlet, Sir. I have seen as fine outsides, as either o'yours, bring
lousy linings to the Brokers, ere now, twice a week


Do you think there may be a fine new Cuckingstoole in the Fair, to be
purchased? one large enough, I mean. I know there is a pond of capacity, for
her


For your mother, you Rascal, out you Rogue, you hedge bird, you Pimpe, you
pannier-mans bastard, you


Ha, ha, ha.


Do you sneerc, you dogs-head, you Trendle tail! you look as you were
begotten a'top of a Cart in haruest-time, when the whelp was hot and eager. Go,
snuff after your brothers bitch, Mrs Commodity, that is the Liuory you wear,
'twill be out at the elbows, shortly. It Is time you went to it, for the to'ther
remnant


Peace, Vrs, peace, Vrs, they will kill the poor Whale, and make oil of her.
Pray thee go in


I Will see 'hem pox'd first, and pil'd, and double pil'd.


Let Us away, her language grows greasier then her Pigs.


Dos't so, snotty nose? good Lord! are you sniueling? you were engendered on a
she-begger, in a barn, when the bald Thrasher, your Sire, was scarce warm


Pray thee, let us go.


No, faith: I Will stay the end of her, now: I know she cannot last long; I
find by her similes, she wanes a pace


Does she so? I Will set you gone. Gi' me my Pig-pan hither a little. I Will
scald you hence, and you will not go


Gentlemen, these are very strange vapors! and very idle vapors! I assure you.


You are a very serious ass, we assure you.


Humh! Ass? and serious? nay, then pardon me my vapor. I have a foolish
vapor, Gentlemen: any man that does vapor me, the Ass, Master Quarlous --


What then, Master Jordan?


I do vapor him the lie.


Faith, and to any man that vapors me the lie, I do vapor that.


Nay, then, vapors upon vapors.


'Ware the pan, the pan, the pan,


Oh.


What Is the matter?


Goodly woman!


Mistress!


Curse of hell, that ever I saw these Feinds, oh! I have scalded my leg, my leg,
my leg, my leg. I have lost a limb in the service! run for some cream and
sallad oil, quickly. Are you vnder-peering, you Baboun? rip off my hose, an'
you be men, men, men


Run you for some cream, good mother Ione. I Will look to your basket.


Best sit up in your chair, Vrsla. Help, Gentlemen.


Be of good cheer, Vrs, thou have hindered me the currying of a couple of
Stallions, here, that abused the good race- Bawd o'Smithfield; 'twas time for
'hem to go


I faith, when the pan came, they had made you run else. (this had been a
fine time for purchase, if you had ventured.


Not a whit, these fellows were too fine to carry money.


Nightingale, get some help to carry her leg out of the air; take off her
shoes; body of me, she has the Mallanders, the scratches, the crown scabbe,
and the quitter bone, in the the other leg


Oh! the pox, why do you put me in mind of my leg, thus, to make it prick,
and shoot? would you have me in the Hospital, before my time


Patience, Vrs, take a good heart, it is but a blister, as big as a Windgall;
I Will take it away with the white of an egg, a little honey, and hogs grease,
have thy pasternes well rol'd, and thou shall't pase again by to morrow. I Will
tend thy Booth, and look to thy affairs, the while: thou shall sit i'thy
chair, and give directions, and shine Vrsa mayor


THese are the fruits of bottle-ale, and tobacco! the foam of the one, and the
fumes of the other! Stay young man, and despise not the wisdom of these few
hayres, that are grown gray in care of thee


Nightingale, stay a little. Indeed I Will hear some of this!


Come, Numps, come, where are you? welcome into the Fair, Mistress Grace.


S'light, he will call company, you shall see, and put us into doings
presently


Thirst not after that frothy liquor, Ale: for, who knows, when he opens
the stopple, what may be in the bottle? has not a Snaile, a Spider, yea, a
Neuft bin found there? thirst not after it, youth: thirst not after it


This is a brave fellow, Numps, let us hear him.


S'blood, how brave is he? in a guarded coat? you were best trucke with him,
even strip, and trucke presently, it will become you, why will you hear him,
because he is an Ass, and may be a kinnne to the Cokeses


O, good Numps!


Neither do thou lust after that tawney weed, tobacco.


Brave words!


Whose complexion is like the Indians that vents it!


Are they not brave words, Sister?


And who can tell, if, before the gathering, and making up thereof, the
Alligarta has not pissed thereon


'Heart let 'hem be brave words, as brave as they will! and they were all the
brave words in a Country, how then? will you away yet? have you enough on him?
Mistress Grace, come you away, I pray you, be not you accessory. If you do lose
your License, or somewhat else, Sir, with listening to his fables: say, Numps,
is a witch, with all my heart, do, say so


Avoid in your satin doublet, Numps.


The creeping venom of which subtle serpent, as some late writers affirm;
neither the cutting of the perrillous plant, nor the drying of it, nor the
lighting, or burning, can any way perssway or, assuage


Good, in faith! is it not Sister?


Hence it is, that the lungs of the Tabacconist are rotted, the Liver spotted,
the brain smoked like the backside of the Pig-womans Booth, here, and the
whole body within, black, as her Pan, you saw even now, without


A fine similitude, that, Sir! did you see the pan?


Yes, Sir.


Nay, the hole in the nose here, of some tabacco-takers, or the third
nostrill, (if I may so call it) which makes, that they can vent the tobacco
out, like the Ace of clubs, or rather the Flower-de-lice, is caused from the
tobacco, the mere tobacco! when the poor innocent pox, having nothing to do
there, is miserably, and most unconscionably slandered


Who would have mist this, Sister?


Not any body, but Numps.


He does not understand.


Nor you feel.


What would you have, Sister, Fair, will not move a logge.


In, to Vrsla, Nightingale, and carry her comfort: see it told. This fellow was
sent to us by fortune, for our first fairing


But what speak I of the diseases of the body, children of the Fair?


That Is to us, Sister. Brave in faith!


Hark, O, you sons and daughters of Smithfield! and hear what mallady it
does the mind: It causes swearing, it causes swaggering, it causes
snuffling, and snarling, and now and then a hurt


He has something of Master Ouerdoo, me thinks, brother.


So me thought, Sister, very much of my brother Ouerdoo: And it is, when he
speaks


Look into any Angle of the town, (the Streights, or the Bermuda's) where the
quarrelling lesson is read, and how do they entertain the time, but with
bottle-ale, and tobacco? The Lecturer is o'one side, and his Pupils of the
other; But the seconds are still bottle-ale, and tobacco, for which the
Lecturer reads, and the Nouices pay. Thirty pound a week in bottle-ale! forty
in tobacco! and ten more in Ale again. Then for a suit to drink in, so much,
and (that being slauer'd) so much for another suit, and then a third suit, and
a fourth suit! and still the bottle-ale slauereth, and the tobacco stinketh


Heart of a madman! are you rooted here? well you never away? what can any
man find out in this bawling fellow, to grow here for? he is a full handful
higher, sin'he heard him, will you fix here? and set up a Booth? Sir


I will conclude briefly --


Hold your peace, you roaring Rascal, I Will run my head in your chaps else.
You were best build a Booth, and entertain him, make your Will, and you say
the word, and him your heir! heart, I never knew one taken with a mouth of a
pecke, before.


Stay Numpes, stay, set me down: I have lost my purse, Numps, O my purse! one
of my fine purses is gone


Is It indeed, brother?


I, as I am an honest man, would I were an errant Rogue, else! a plague of all
roguy, damned cut-purses for me


Bless 'hem with all my heart, with all my heart, do you see! Now, as I am no
Infidel, that I know of, I am glad on it. I I am, (here is my witness!) do you
see, Sir? I did not tell you of his fables, I? no, no, I am a dull malt-horse,
I, I know nothing. Are you not justly served in your conscience now? speak
in your conscience. Much good do you with all my heart, and his good heart that
has it, with all my heart again


This fellow is very charitable, would he had a purse too! but, I must not be
too bold, all at a time


Nay, Numps, it is not my best purse.


Not your best! death! why should it be your worst? why should it be any,
indeed, at all? answer me to that, gi' me a reason from you, why it should be
any


Nor my gold, Numps; I have that yet, look here else, Sister.


Why so, there is all the feeling he has!


I pray you, have a better care of that, brother.


Nay, so I will, I warrant you; let him catch this, that catch can. I would
feign see him get this, look you here


So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so! Very good.


I would have him come again, now, and but offer at it. Sister, will you take
notice of a good jest? I will put it just where the other was, and if we have
good luck, you shall see a delicate fine trap to catch the cutpurse, nibling


Faith, and he will try ere you be out of the Fair.


Come, Mistress Grace, prithee be not melancholy for my mis-chance; sorrow
wi'not keep it, Sweet heart


I do not think on it, Sir.


'Twas but a little scuruy white money, hang it: it may hang the cutpurse, one
day. I have gold left to gi'thee a fayring, yet, as hard as the world goes:
nothing angers me, but that no body here, looked like a cutpurse, unless
'twere Numps


How? I? I look like a cutpurse? death! your Sister's a cutpurse! and your
mother and father, and all your kin were cutpurses! And here is a Rogue is
the baud of the cutpurses, whom I will beat to begin with


Numps, Numps.


Good Mr Humphrey.


You are the Patrico! are you? the Patriarch of the cutpurses? you share, Sir,
they say, let them share, this with you. Are you in your hot fit of preaching
again? I Will cool you


Hold thy hand, child of wrath, and heir of anger, Bartholmew, Parent of the
of the Massacre


Murder, murder, murder.

Come, come, you told me a pudding, Toby Haggise; A matter of nothing; I am
sure it came to nothing! you said, let us go to Vrsla's, indeed; but then you
met the man with the monsters, and I could not get you from him. An old fool,
not leave seeing yet


Why, who would have thought any body would have quarreled so early? or that
the ale of the. Fair would have been up so soon


Phy? phat a clock toest tou tinke it ish, man?


I cannot tell.


Tou art a vishe vatchman, i'te mean teeme.


Why? should the watch go by the clock, or the clock by the watch, I pray?


One should go by another, if they did well.


Tou art right now! phen did tou ever know, or hear of a shuffishient
vatchman, but he did tell the clock, phat bushinesse soever he had


Nay, that is most true, a sufficient watchman knows what a clock it is.

Why, what an' you have, Captain Whit? he has his choice of Ierkins, you may

sick, or employed


God a mercy Ione, answer for me.


Away, be not sheen i'my company, here be shentlemen, and men of vorship.


We had wonderful ill luck, to miss this prologue of the purse, but the
best is, we shall have five Acts of him ere night: he will be spectacle enough!

Look! who comes here! John Little-wit!


And his wife, and my widow, her mother: the whole family.


'Slight, you must gi'hem all fairings, now!


Not I, I Will not see 'hem,


They are going a feasting. What Schole-master's that is with 'hem?


That Is my Rival, I believe, the Baker!


So, walk on in the middle way, fore-right, turn neither to the right hand,
nor to the left: let not your eyes be drawn aside with vanity, nor your ear
with noyses


O, I know him by that start!


What do you lack? what do you buy, pretty Mistress! a fine Hobbyhorse, to make
your son a Tilter? a Drum to make him a Soldier? a Fiddle, to make him a
Reueller? What is it you lack? Little Dogs for your Daughters! or Babies, male,
or female


Look not toward them, harken not: the place is Smithfield, or the field of
Smiths, the Grove of Hobbi-horses and trinkets, the wares are the wares of
devils. And the whole Fair is the shop of Satan! They are hooks, and baits,
very baits, that are hung out on every side, to catch you, and to hold you as
it were, by the gills; and by the nostrills, as the Fisher does: therefore, you
must not look, nor turn toward them -- The Heathen man could stop his ears
with wax, against the harlot of the sea: Do you the like, with your fingers
against the bells of the Beast


What flashes comes from him!


O, he has those of his oven! a notable hot Baker 'twas, when he plied the
peele: he is leading his flock into the Fair, now


Rather driving 'hem to the Pens: for he will let 'hem look upon nothing.


Gentlewomen, the weather's hot! whither walk you? Have a care o'your fine
velvet caps, Fair is dusty. Take a sweet delicate Booth, with boughs, here,
in the way, and cool your selves in the shade: you and your friends. The best
pig and bottle-ale in the Fair, Sir. Old Vrsla is Cook, there you may read:
the pigges head speaks it. Poor soul, she has had a Sringhalt, the
Maryhinchco: but she is prettily amended


A delicate show-pig, little Mistress, with shweet sauce, and crackling, like de
bay-leafe i would fire, la! Tou shall ha'de clean side o'de table-clot and di

This's sine, verily, here be the best pigs: and she does roast 'hem as well
as ever she did; the Pigs head says


Excellent, excellent, Mistress, with fire of Juniper and Rose-mary branches!
The Oracle of the Pigs head, that, Sir


Son, were you not warned of the vanity of the eye? have you forgot the
wholesome admonition, so soon


Good mother, how shall we find a pigge, if we do not look about for it? will
it run off of the spit, into our mouths think you? as in Lubberland? and cry,
we, we


No, but your mother, religiously wise, conceiueth it may offer it self, by
other means, to the sense, as by way of steeme, which I think it does,


Come, Win, as good winny here, as go farther, and see nothing.


We escape so much of the other vanities, by our early entering.


It is an aedifying consideration.


This is scuruy, that we must come into the Fair, and not look on it.


Win, have patience, Win, I Will tell you more anon.


Moone-calfe; entertain within there, the best pig in the Booth; a Porklike
pig. These are Banbury-bloods, of the sincere stud, come a pigge-hunting. Whit,
wait Whit, look to your charge


A pigge prepare, presently, let a pigge be prepared to us.


S'light, who be these?


Is this the good service, Jordan, you would do me?


Why, Vrs? why, Vrs? thou wilt have vapors i'thy leg again presently, pray
thee go in, 't may turn to the scratches else


Hang your vapors, they are stale, and stink like you, are these the guests
of the game, you promised to fill my pit withal, to day


I^ what aile they Vrs?


Aile they? they are all sippers, sippers of the City, they look as they would
not drink off two penn'orth of bottle-ale amongst 'hem


A body may read that i'their small printed ruffes.


Away, thou art a fool, Vrs, and thy Moone-calfe too, in your ignorant vapors,
now? hence, good guests, I say right hypocrites, good gluttons. In, and set a
couple o'pigs of the board, and half a dozen of the biggest bottles before 'hem,
and call Whit, I do not love to hear Innocents abused: Fine ambling
hypocrites! and a stone-puritane, with a sorrel head, and beard, good mouthed
gluttons: two to a pigge, away


Are you sure they are such?


Of The right breed, thou shall try 'hem by the teeth, Vrs, where is this Whit?


Behold, man and see, what a worthy man am ee!
With the fury of my sword, and the shaking of my beard,
I will make ten thousand men afeard.

Well said, brave Whit, in, and fear the ale out of the bottles, into the
bellies of the brethren, and the sisters drink to the cause, and pure vapors


My Roarer is turned Tapster, me thinks. Now were a fine time for thee,
Win-wife, to lay aboard thy widow, thou wilt never be Master of a better season,
or place; she that will venture her self into the Fair, and a pig-boxe, will
admit any assault, be assured of that


I love not enterprises of that suddenness, though.


I Will warrant thee, then, no wife out of the widows Hundred: if I had but as
much Title to her, as to have breathed once on that straight stomacher of hers,
I would now assure my felfe to carrry her, yet, ere shewent out of Smithfield.
Or she should carry me, which were the fitter sight, I confess. But you are a
modest undertaker, by circumstances, and degrees; come, it is Disease in thee,
not Judgment, I should offer at all together. Look, here is the poor fool,
again, that was stung by the waspe, ere while


I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragical conclusions. And I
begin now to think, that by a spice of collateral Justice, Adam Ouerdoo,
deserved this beating; for I the said Adam, was one cause (a by-cause) why the
purse was lost: and my wives brothers purse too, which they know not of yet.
But I shall make very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport)
and put my little friend, Mr Humphrey Wasp's choler quite out of countenance.
When, sitting at the upper end of my Table, as I use, and drinking to my brother
Cokes, and Mrs. Alice Ouerdoo, as I will, my wife, for their good affection to
old Bradley, I deliver to'hem, it was I, that was cudgelled, and show 'hem the
marks. To see what bad events may peep out of the tail of good purposes! the
care I had of that civil young man, I took fancy to this morning, (and have not
left it yet) drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeeede,
which drew the cutpurse; which drew the money; which drew my brother Cokes his
loss; which drew on Wasp's anger; which drew on my beating: a pretty
gradation! And they shall have it i'their dish, in faith, at night for fruit: I
love to be merry at my Table. I had thought once, at one special blow he
ga'me, to have revealed my self? but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembered
that a wise man (and who is ever so great a part, of the Commonwealth in
himself) for no particular disaster ought to abandon a public good design.
The husbandman ought not for one unthankful year, to forsake the plough; The
Shepherd ought not, for one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot
ought not for one leake in the poope, to quit the Helm; Nor the Alderman ought
not for one custerd more, at a meal, to give up his cloak; The Constable
ought not to break his staff, and forswear the watch, for one roaring night;
Nor the Piper of the Parish (Vt paruis componere magna solebam) to put up his
pipes, for one rainy Sunday. These are certain knocking conclusions; out of
which, I am resolved, come what come can, come beating, come imprisonment, come
infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come the hurdle, (welcome all) I
will not discover who I am, till my due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I
said ever, in Justice name, and the King's, and for the Commonwealth


What does he talk to himself, and act so seriously? poor fool!


No matter what. Here Is fresher argument, intend that.


COme, Mistress Grace, come Sister, here is more fine sights, yet in faith.
Gods'lid where is Numps


What do you lack, Gentlemen? what is it you buy? fine Rattles! Drums?
Babies? little Dogs? and Birds for Ladies? What do you lack


Good honest Numpes, keep before, I am so afraid thou wilt lose somewhat: my
heart was at my mouth, when I mist thee


You were best buy a whip in your hand to drive me.


Nay, do not mistake, Numps, thou art so apt to mistake: I would but watch the
goods. Look you now, the treble fiddle, was even almost like to be lost


Pray you take heed you lose not your self: your best way, were even get up,
and ride for more surety. Buy a tokens worth of great pinnes, to fasten your
self to my shoulder


What do you lack, Gentlemen? fine purses, pouches, pincases, pipes? What
is it you lack? a pair o'smithes to wake you in the morning? or a fine
whistling bird


Numps, here be finer things then any we have bought by odds! and more delicate
horses, a great deal! good Numpes, stay, and come hither


Will you scourse with him? you are in Smithfield, you may fit your self with
a fine easy-going street-nag, for your saddle again' Michaelmasse-terme, do,
has he never a little odd cart for you, to make a Carroch on, in the country,
with four pyed hobby horses? why the meazills, should you stand here, with
your train, cheaping of Dogs, Birds, and Babies? you have no children to
bestow 'hem on? have you


No, but again' I have children, Numps, that is all one.


Do, do, do, do; how many shall you have, think you? an' I were as you, I Would
buy for all my Tenants, too, they are a kind o'ciuill Savages, that will part
with their children for rattles, pipes, and knives. You were best buy a
hatchet, or two, and truck with 'hem


Good Numps, hold that little tongue o'thine, and faue it a labor. I am
resolute Bat, thou know'ft


A resolute fool, you are, I know, and a very sufficient Coxcombe; with all my
heart; nay you have it, Sir, and you be angry, turd in your teeth, twice: (if I
said it not once before) and much good do you


Was there ever such a selfe-affliction? and so impertinent?


Alas! his care will go near to crack him, let us in, and comfort him.


Would I had been set in the ground, all but the head on me, and had my brains
bowl'd at, or thresh'd out, when first I underwent this plague of a charge


How now, Numps! almost tired in your Protectorship? ouerparted? ouerparted?


Why, I cannot tell, Sir, it may be I am, dos't grieve you?


No, I swear dos't not, Numps: to satisfy you.


Numps? S'blood, you are fine and familiar! how long have we bin acquainted, I
pray you


I think it may be remembered, Numps, that? 'twas since morning sure.


Why, I hope I know it well enough, Sir, I did not ask to be told.


No? why then?


It Is no matter why, you see with your eyes, now, what I said to you to day?
you will believe me another time


Are you removing the Fair, Numps?


A pretty question! and a very civil one! yes faith, I have my lading you see;
or shall have anon, you may know whose beast I am, by my burden. If the
pannier-mans Jack were ever better known by his loins of mutton, I Will be
flead, and feed dogs for him, when his time comes


How melancholi' Mistress Grace is yonder! pray thee let us go enter our
selves in Grace, with her


Those six horses, friend I Will have --


How!


And the three Jews trumps; and half a dozen o'Birds, and that Drum, (I have
one Drum already) and your Smiths; I like that device o'your smiths, very
pretty well, and four Halberts -- and (le'me see) that fine painted great
Lady, and her three women for state, I Will have


No, the shop; buy the whole shop, it will be best, the shop, the shop!


If his worship please.


Yes, and keep it during the Fair, Bobchin.


Peace, Numps, friend, do not meddle with him, an' you be wise, and would show
your head above board: he will sting through your wrought nightcap, believe
me. A set of these Violines, I would buy too, for a delicate young noise I have
in the country, that are every one a size less then another, just like your
fiddles. I would feign have a fine young Masque at my marriage, now I think
on it: but I do want such a number o'things. And Numps will not help me now,
and I dare not speak to him


Will your worship buy any ginger-bread, very good bread, comfortable bread?


Ginger-bread! yes, let us see.


There Is the the other sprindge?


Is this well, goody Ione? to interrupt my market? in the midst? and call away
my customers? can you answer this, at the Piepouldres


Why? if his Master-ship have a mind to buy, I hope my ware lies as open as
another's; I may show my ware, as well as you yours


Hold your peace; I Will content you both: I Will buy up his shop, and thy basket.


Will you in faith?


Why should you put him from it, friend?


Cry you mercy! you would be sold too, would you? what is the price on you? Ierkin,
and all as you stand? have you any qualities


Yes, good man angry-man, you shall find he has qualities, if you cheapen him.


Gods so, you have the selling of him! what are they? will they be bought for
love, or money


No indeed, Sir.


For what then? victuals?


He scorns victuals, Sir, he has bread and butter at home, thanks be to God!
and yet he will do more for a good meal, if the toy take him in the belly, mary
then they must not set him at lower end; if they do, he will go away, though he
fast. But put him a top of the Table, where his place is, and he will do you
forty fine things. He has not been sent for, and sought out for nothing, at
your great citty-suppers, to put down Coriat, and Cokeley, and bin laughed at
for his labor; he will play you all the Puppets in the town over, and the
Players, every company, and his own company too; he spares no body


In Faith?


He was the first, Sir, that ever baited the fellow in the beare's skin, an't
like your worship: no dog ever came near him, since. And for fine motions


Is he good at those too? can he set out a Masque trow?


O Lord, Master! sought to far, and near, for his inventions: and he
engrosses all, he makes all the Puppets in the Fair


Do thou (in noth) old velvet Ierkin? give me thy hand.


Nay, Sir, you shall see him in his velvet Ierkin, and a scarf, too, at night,
when you hear him interpret Master Little-wit's Motion


Speak no more, but shut up shop presently, friend. I Will buy both it, and thee
too, to carry down with me, and her hamper, beside. Thy shop shall furnish out
the Masque, and hers the Banquet: I cannot go less, to set out any thing with
credit. what is the price, at a word, o'thy whole shop, case, and all as it
stands


Sir, it stands me in six and twenty shillings seven pence, halfe-peny,
besides three shillings for my ground


Well, thirty shillings will do all, then! And what comes yours too?


Four shillings, and eleauen pence, Sir, ground, and all, an't like your
worship


Yes, it does like my worship very well, poor woman, that is five shillings
more, what a Masque shall I furnish out, for forty shillings? (twenty pound
scotsh) and a Banquet of Ginger-bread? there is a stately thing! Numps? Sister?
and my wedding gloves too? (that I never thought on before.) All my wedding
gloves, Ginger-bread? O me! what a device will there be? to make 'hem eat
their fingers ends! and delicate Brooches for the Bride-men! and all! and then
I Will have this poesy put to 'hem: For the best grace, meaning Mistress Grace,
my wedding poesy


I am beholden to you, Sir, and to your Bartholmew-wit.


You do not mean this, do you? is this your first purchase?


Yes faith, and I do not think, Numpes, but thou wilt say, it was the wisest
Act, that ever I did in my wardship


Like enough! I shall say any thing, I!


I Cannot beget a Project, with all my political brain, yet; my Project is
how to fetch off this proper young man, from his debaucht company: I have
followed him all the Fair over, and still I find him with this songster: And
I begin shrewdly to suspect their familiarity; and the young man of a terrible
taint, Poetry! ^^ith which idle disease, if he be infected, there is no hope of
him, in a state-course. Actum est, of him for a common-wealths-man: if he go
to it in Rhyme, once


Yonder he is buying o'Ginger-bread: set in quickly, before he part with too
much on his money


My masters and friends, and good people, draw near, etc.


Ballads! hark, hark! pray thee, fellow, stay a little, Numpes, look to the
goods. What Ballads have thou? let me see, let me see my self


Why so! he is flowne'to another lime-bush, there he will flutter as long more;
till he have never a feather left. Is there a vexation like this, Gentlemen?
will you believe me now, hereafter? shall I have credit with you


Yes faith, shall thou, Numps, and thou art worthy on it, for thou sweatest
for it. I never saw a young Pimpe errant, and his Squire better matched


Faith, the sister comes after 'hem, well, too.


Nay, if you saw the Justice her husband, my Guardian, you were fitted for the
Mess, he is such a wise one his way --


I wonder, we see him not here.


O! he is too serious for this place, and yet better sport then then the other
three, I assure you, Gentlemen: where ere he is, though it be of the Bench


How do thou call it! A caveat against cutpurses! a good jest, in faith, I
would feign see that Demon, your Cutpurse,


Sir, this is a spell against 'hem, spicke and span new; and it is made as
'twere in mine own person, and I sing it in mine own defense. But 'twill cost
a penny alone, if you buy it


No matter for the price, thou do not know me, I see, I am an odd Bartholmew.


Have a fine picture, Brother?


O Sister, do you remember the ballads over the Nursery-chimney at home of my
own pasting up, there be brave pictures. Other manner of pictures, than these,
friend


Yet these will serve to pick the pictures out of your pockets, you shall see.


So, I heard 'hem say. Pray thee-mind him not, fellow: he will have an oar in
every thing


It was intended Sir, as if a purse should chance to be cut in my presence,
now, I may be blameless, though: as by the sequel, will more plainly appear


We shall find that in the matter. Pray thee begin.


To the tune of Paggingtons Pound, Sir.


Fa, la la la, la la la, fa la la la. Nay, I Will put thee in tune, and all! mine
own country dance! Pray thee begin


It is a gentle admonition, you must know, Sir, both to the purse-cutter, and
the purse-bearer


Not a word more, out of the tune, an' thou love me: Fa, la la la, la la la,
fa la la la. Come, when


My masters and friends, and good people draw near,
And look to your purses, for that I do say;

Ha, ha, this chimes! good counsel at first dash.


And though little money, in them you do bear.
It cost more to get, then to lose in a day.
You often have been told,
Both the young and the old;
And bidden beware of the cutpurse so bold:
Then if you take heed not, free me from the curse,
Who both give you warning, for and, the cutpurse.
Youth, youth, thou had better bin starved by thy Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

Good!


Well said! he were to blame that would not in faith.


Good in faith, how say you, Numps? Is there any harm i'this?


It has bin vpbrayded to men of my trade,
That often times we are the cause of this crime.
Alack and for pity, why should it be said?
As if they regarded or places, or time.
Examples have been
Of some that were seen,
In Westminster Hall, yea the pleaders between,
Then why should the Judges be free from this curse,
More then my poor self, for cutting the purse?
Youth, youth, thou had better bin starved by thy Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

The more coxco^bes they that did it, I wusse.


God a mercy for that! why should they be more free indeed?


That again, good Ballad-man, that again. O rare! Poet to my Masque.


At Worc'ter'tis known well, and even in the layle,
A Knight of good worship did there show his face,
Against the foul sinners, in zeal for to rail,
And lost (ipso facto) his purse in the place.
Nay, once from the Seat
Of Judgment so great,
A Judge there did lose a fair pouch of veluete.
O Lord for thy mercy, how wicked or worse,
Are those that so venture their necks for a purse! Youth, youth, etc.

Is it possible?


In Faith?


Youth, youth, etc? pray thee stay a little, friend, yet o'thy conscience,
Numps, speak, is there any harm i'this


To tell you true, it is too good for you, less you had grace to follow it.


It does discover enormitie, I Will mark it more: I have not liked a paltry piece
of poetry, so well a good while


Youth, youth, etc! where is this youth, now? A man must call upon him, for his
own good, and yet he will not appear: look here, here is for him;
handy-dandy, Youth, the cutpurse


At Plays and at Sermons, and at the Sessions,
It Is daily their practice such booty to make:
Yea, under the Gallows, at Executions,
They stick not the Stare-abouts purses to take.
Nay one without grace,
at a better place,
At Court, and in Christmas, before the Kings face,
Alack then for pity must I bear the curse,
That only belongs to the cunning cutpurse?

That was a fine fellow! I would have him, now.


But where is their cunning, now, when they should use it? they are all chained
now, I warrant you. Youth, youth, thou had better, etc. The Rat-catchers
charm, are all fools and Asses to this! A pox on 'hem, that they will not
come! that a man should have such a desire to a thing, and want it


Before God, I Would give half the Fair, and 'twere mine, for a cutpurse for him,
to save his longing.


Look you Sister, here, here, where is it now? which pocket is it in? for a
wager


I beseech you leave your wagers, and let him end his matter, an't may be.


O, are you aedified Numps?


Indeed he does interrupt him, too much: There Numps spoke to purpose.





But O, you vile nation of cutpurses all,
Relent and repent, and amend and be sound,
And know that you ought not, by honest men's fall,
Advance your own fortunes, to die above ground,
And though you go gay,
In silks as you may,
It is not the high way to heaven, (as they say)
Repent then, repent you, for better, for worse:
And kiss not the Gallows for cutting a purse.
Youth, youth, thou had better bin steru'd by thy Nurse,
Then live to be hanged for cutting a purse.

Will you see sport? look, there is a fellow gathers up to him, mark.


Good, 'i faith ^ome has lighted on the wrong pocket.


He has it, before God he is a brave fellow; pity he should be detected.


An excellent ballad! an excellent ballad!


Friend, let me have the first, let me have the first, I pray you.


Pardon me, Sir. First come, first served; and I Will buy the whole bundle too.


That conueyance was better then all, did you see it? he has given the purse to
the ballad-singer


Has he?


Sir, I cry you mercy; I Will not hinder the poor man's profit: pray you mistake
me not


Sir, I take you for an honest Gentleman; if that be mistaking, I met you to
day before: ha! humh! O God! my purse is gone, my purse, my purse, etc


Come, do not make a stir, and cry your self an Ass, through the Fair
before your time


Why, have thou it, Numpes? good Numpes, how came you by it? I mar'le!


I pray you seek foam other gamster, to play the fool with: you may lose it
time enough, for all your Fayre-wit


By this good hand, glove and all, I have lost it already, if thou have it not:
feel else, and Mistress Grace's handkercher, too, out of the the other pocket


Why, it is well; very well, exceeding pretty, and well.


Are you sure you have lost it, Sir?


O God! yes; as I am an honest man, I had it but even now, at youth, youth.


I hope you suspect not me, Sir.


Thee? that were a jest indeed! Do thou think the Gentleman is foolish?
where had thou hands, I pray thee? Away Ass, away


I shall be beaten again, if I be spied.


Sir, I suspect an odd fellow, yonder, is stealing away.


Brother, it is the preaching fellow! you shall suspect him. He was at your
the other purse, you know! Nay, stay, Sir, and view the work you have done, an'
you be beneficed at the Gallows, and preach there, thank your own
handy-worke


Sir, you shall take no pride in your preferment: you shall be silenced quickly.


What do you mean? sweet buds of gentility.


To have my peneworths out on you: Bud. No less then two purses a day, serve
you? I thought you a simple fellow, when my man Numpes beat you, in the
morning, and pitied you --


So did I, I Will besworne, brother; but now I see he is a lewd, and pernicious
Enormity: (as Master Ouerdoo calls him.


Mine own words turned upon me, like swords.


Cannot a man's purse be at quiet for you, in the Masters pocket, but you must
entice it forth, and debauch it


Sir, Sir, keep your debauch, and your fine Bartholmew-termes to your self;
and make as much on'hem as you please. But gi'me this from you, in the mean
time: I beseech you, see if I can look to this.


Why, Numps?


Why? because you are an Ass, Sir, there is a reason the shortest way, and you
will needs have it; now you have got the trick of losing, you would lose your
breech, an't 'twere loofe. I know you, Sir, come, deliver, you will go and
crack the vermin, you breed now, will you? it is very fine, will you have the
truth on it? they are such retchlesse flies as you are, that blow cutpurses
abroad in every corner; your foolish having of money, makes 'hem. An' there
were no wiser then I, Sir, the trade shoud lie open for you, Sir, it should
in faith, Sir. I would teach your wit to come to your head, Sir, as well as your
land to come into your hand, I assure you, Sir


Alack, good Numps.


Nay, Gentlemen, never pity me, I am not worth it: Lord send me at home once,
to Harrow of the Hill again, if I travel any more, call me Coriat; withal my
heart


Stay, Sir, I must have a word with you in private. Do you hear?


With me, Sir? what is your pleasure? good Sir.


Do not deny it. You are a cutpurse, Sir, this Gentleman here, and I, saw you,
nor do we mean to detect you (though we can sufficiently inform our selves,
toward the danger of concealing you) but you must do us a piece of service


Good Gentlemen; do not undo me; I am a civil young man, and but a beginner,
indeed


Sir, your beginning shall bring on your ending, for us. We are no Catchpoles
nor Constables. That you are to undertake, is this; you saw the old fellow,
with the black box, here


The little old Governor, Sir?


That same: I see, you have flowne him to a mark already. I would have you get
away that box from him, and bring it us


Would you have the box and all, Sir? or only that, that is in it? I Will get you
that, and leave him the box, to play with still: (which will be the harder
of the two) because I would gain your worships good opinion of me


He says well, it is the greater Mastry, and 'twill make the more sport when
it is mist


I, and 'twill be the longer a missing, to draw on the sport.


But look you do it now, sirrah, and keep your word: or --


Sir, if ever I break my word, with a Gentleman, may I never read word at my
need. Where shall I find you


Some-where in the Fair, heereabouts. Dispatch it quickly. I would feign see
the careful fool deluded! of all Beasts, I love the serious Ass. He that
takes pains to be one, and plays the fool, with the greatest diligence that
can be


Then you would not chose, Sir, but love my Guardian, Justice Ouerdoo, who is
answerable to that description, in every hair of him


So I have heard. But how came you, Mistis Welborne, to be his Ward? or have
relation to him, at first


Faith, through a common calamity, he bought me, Sir; and now he will marry me
to his wives brother, this wise Gentleman, that you see, or else I must pay
value of my lan


S'lid, is there no device of disparagement? or so? talk with some crafty
fellow, some pick lock of the Law! Would I had studied a year longer in the
Innes of Court, and't had been but in your case


I Master Quarlous, are you proffering?


You Would bring but little aid, Sir.


(I Will look to you 'ifaith, Gamster.) An unfortunate foolish Tribe you are
fallen into, Lady, I wonder you can endure 'hem


Sir, they that cannot work their fetters off; must wear 'hem.


You see what care they have on you, to leave you thus.


Faith the same they have of themselves, Sir. I cannot greatly complain, if
this were all the plea I had against 'hem


It Is true! but will you please to withdraw with us, a little, and make them
think, they have lost you. I hope our manners have been such hitherto, and our
language, as will give you no cause, to doubt your self, in our company


Sir, I will give my self, no cause; I am so secure of mine own manners, as I
suspect not yours


Look where John Little-wit comes.


Away, I Will not be seen, by him.


No, you were not best, hee'ld tell his mother, the widow.


Heatt, what do you mean?


Cry you mercy, is the wind there? must not the widow be named?


Do you hear Win, Win?


What say you, John?


While they are paying the reckoning, Win, I Will tell you a thing Win, we shall
never see any sights in the Fair, Win, except you long still, Win, good Win,
sweet Win, long to see some Hobby-horses, and some Drums, and Rattles, and
Dogs, and fine devices, Win. The Bull with the five legs, Win; and the great
Hog: now you have begun with Pigge, you may long for any thing, Win, and so for
my Motion, Win


But we shall not eat of the Bull, and the Hog, John, how shall I long then?


O yes! Win: you may long to see, as well as to taste, Win: how did the
Pothecarie's wife, Win, that longed to see the Anatomy, Win? or the Lady, Win,
that desired to spit in the great Lawyers mouth, after an eloquent pleading? I
assure you they longed, VVin, good Win, go in, and long


I think we are rid of our new customer, brother Leatherhead, we shall hear
no more of him.


All the better, let us pack up all, and be gone, before he find us.


Stay a little, yonder comes a company: it may be we may take some more money.


Sir, I will take your counsel, and cut my hair, and leave vapors: I see,
that Tobacco, and Bottle-Ale, and Pig, and Whit, and very Vrsla, her self, is
all vanity


Only Pigge was not comprehended in my admonition, the rest were. For long
hair, it is an Ensign of pride, a banner, and the world is full of those
banners, very full of Banners. And, bottle-ale is a drink of Sathan's, a
diet-drinke of Satan's, devised to puff us up, and make us swell in this
latter age of vanity, as the smoke of tobacco, to keep us in mist and error:
But the fleshly woman, (which you call Vrsla) is above all to be avoided,
having the marks upon her, of the three enemies of Man, the World, as being in
the Fair; the Devil, as being in the fire; and and the Flesh, as being her
self


Brother Zeale-of-the-land! what shall we do? my daughter Win-the-fight, is
fallen into her fit of longing again


For more pig? there is no more, is there?


To see some sights, in the Fair.


Sister, let her fly the impurity of the place, swiftly, lest she partake of
the pitch thereof. Thou art the seat of the Beast, O Smithfield, and I will
leave thee. Idolatry peepeth out on every side of thee


An excellent right Hypocrite! now his belly is full, he falls a railing and
kicking, the Jade. A very good vapor! I Will in, and joy Vrsla, with telling,
how her pigge works, two and a half he eat to his share. And he has drunk a
pailefull. He eats with his eyes, as well as his teeth


What do you lack, Gentlemen? What is it you buy? Rattles, Drumms, Babies. --


Peace, with thy Apocryphal wares, thou profane Publican: thy Bells, thy
Dragons, and thy Tobie's Dogs. Thy Hobbyhorse is an Idol, a very Idol, a
feirce and rank Idol: And thou, the Nabuchadnezzar, the proud Nabuchadnezzar
of the Fair, that set'st it up, for children to fall down to, and worship


Cry you mercy, Sir, will you buy a fiddle to fill up your noise.


Look Win. do, look a Gods name, and save your longing. Here be fine sights.


I child, so you hate 'hem, as our Brother Zeal does, you may look on 'hem.


Or what do you say, to a Drum. Sir?


It is the broken belly of the Beast, and thy Bellows there are his lungs, and
these Pipes are his throat, those Feathers are of his tail, and thy Rattles,
the gnashing of his teeth


And what is my ginger-bread? I pray you.


The prouander that pricks him up. Hence with thy basket of Popery, thy nest of
Images: and whole legend of ginger-worke


Sir if you be not quiet, the quicklier, I Will have you clapped fairly by the
heels, for disturbing the Fair


The sin of the Fair prouokes me, I cannot be silent.


Good brother Zeal!


Sir, I Will make you silent, believe it.


Il'd give a shilling, you could in faith, friend.


Sir, give me your shilling, I Will give you my shop, if I do not, and I Will leave
it in pawn with you, in the mean time


A match in faith, but do it quickly, then.


Hinder me not, woman. I was moved in spirit, Fair, this wicked, and foul
Fair; and fitter may it be a called a foul, then a Fair: To protest against
the abuses of it, the foul abuses of it, in regard of the afflicted Saints,
that are troubled, very much troubled, exceedingly troubled, with the opening
of the merchandise of Babylon again, and the peeping of Popery upon the stals,
here, here, in the high places. See you not Goldylocks, the purple strumpet,
there? in her yellow gown, and green sleeves? the profane pipes, the
tinckling timbrells? A shop of relics


Pray you forbear, I am put in trust with 'hem.


And this Idolatrous Grove of Images, this flasket of Idols!


O my ware, my ware, God bless it.)


In my zeal, and glory to be thus exercised.


Here he is, pray you lay hold on his zeal, we cannot sell a whistle, for
him, in tune. Stop his noise, first


Thou can not: it is a sanctified noise.


Sir, here is no man afraid of you, or your cause. You shall swear it, in the
stocks, Sir


I will thrust my self into the stocks, upon the pikes of the Land.


Carry him away.


What do you mean, wicked men?


Let them alone; I fear them not.


Was not this shilling well ventured, Win? for our liberty? Now we may go
play, and see over the Fair, where we list our selves; my mother is gone after
him, and let her even go, and loose us


Yes John, but I know not what to do.


For what, Win?


For a thing, I am ashamed to tell you, in faith, and it is too far to go home.


I pray thee be not ashamed, VVin. Come, in faith thou shall not be ashamed, is
it any thing about the Hobby-horse-man? an't be, speak freely


Hang him, base Bobehin, I scorn him; no, I have very great, what sha'call'um,
John


o! Is that all, Win? we will go back to Captain Jordan; to the pig-womans,
Win. he will help us, or she with a dripping pan, or an old kettle, or
something. The poor greasy soul loves you, Win, and after we'll visit the
Fair all over, Win, and, see my Puppet play, Win, you know it is a fine matter,
Win


Let Us away, I counseled you to pack up before, Ione.


A pox of his Bedlem purity. He has spoiled half my ware: but the best is,
we lose nothing, if we miss our first Merchant


It shall be hard for him to find, or know us, when we are translated, Ione.


MY Masters, I do make no doubt, but you are officers.


What then, Sir?


And the Kings loving, and obedient subjects.


Obedient, friend? take heed what you speak, I advise you: Oliver Bristle
aduises you. His loving subjects, we grant you: but not his obedient, at this
time, by your leave, we know our selves, a little better then so, we are to
command, Sr. and such as you are to be obedient. Here Is one of his obedient
subjects, going to the stocks, and we will make you such another, if you talk


You are all wise enough in your places, I know.


If you know it, Sir, why do you bring it in question?


I question nothing, pardon me. I do only hope you have warrant,


What Is he? bring him up to the stocks there. Why bring you him not up?


If you have Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, it is well:


Like enough, Sir, but let me tell you, an' you play away your buttons, thus,
you will want 'hem ere night,


What should he be, that does so esteem, and advance my warrant? he seems a
sober and discreet person! it is a comfort to a good conscience, to be followed
with a good fame, in his sufferings. The world will have a pretty taste by this,
how I can bear adversity: and it will beget a kind of reverence, toward me,
hereafter, even from mine enemies, when they shall see I carry my calamity
nobly, and that it does neither break me, nor bend me


Come, Sir, here is a place for you to preach in.


That I will, cheerfully.


OF my conscience a Seminary!


Well my Masters, I Will leave him with you; now I see him bestowed, I Will go
look for my goods, and Numps


You may, Sir, I warrant you; where is the the other Bawler? fetch him too, you
shall find 'hem both fast enough


In the midst of this tumult, I will yet be the Author of mine own rest, and
not minding their fury, sit in the stocks, in that calm, as shall be able to
trouble a Triumph.


Do you assure me upon your words? may I undertake for you, if I be asked the
question; that you have this warrant


What Is this fellow, for Gods sake?


Do but show me Adam Ouerdoo, and I am satisfied.


He is a fellow that is distracted, they say; one Trouble-all: he was an
officer in the Court of Pie-poulders, here last year, and put out on his place
by Justice Ouerdoo


Ha!


Upon which, he took an idle conceit, and's run mad upon it. So that ever
since, he will do nothing, but by Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, he will not eat
a crust, nor drink a little, nor make him in his apparel, ready. His wife,
Sirreuerence, cannot get him make his water, or shift his shirt, without his
warrant


If this be true, this is my greatest disaster! how am I bound to satisfy this
poor man, that is of so good a nature to me, out of his wits! where there is
no room left for dissembling.


If you cannot show me Adam Ouerdoo, I am in doubt of you: I am afraid you
cannot answer it.


Before me, Neighbor Bristle (and now I think on it better) Justice Ouerdoo,
is a very parantory person


O! are you advised of that? and a severe Iusticer, by your leave.


Do I hear ill o'that side, too?


He will sit as upright of the bench, an' you mark him, as a candle in the
socket, and give light to the whole Court in every business


But he will burn blew, and swell like a bile (God bless us) an' he be angry.


I, and he will be angry too, when his list, that is more: and when he is
angry, be it right or wrong; he has the Law on's side, ever. I mark that too


I will be more tender hereafter. I see compassion may become a Justice, though
it be a weakness, I confess; and nearer a vice, then a virtue





Come, bring him away to his fellow, there. Master Busy, we shall rule your
legs, I hope, though we cannot rule your tongue


No, Minister of darkness, no, thou can not rule my tongue, my tongue it is
mine own, and with it I will both knock, and mock down your
Bartholmew-abhominations, till you be made a hissing to the neighbor Parishes,
round about


Let him alone, we have devised better upon it.


And shall he not into the stocks then?


No, Mistress, we will have 'hem both to Justice Ouerdoo, and let him do over
'hem as is fitting. Then I, and my gossip Haggis, and my beadle Pocher are
discharged


O, I thank you, blessed, honest men!


Nay, never thank us, but thank this madman that comes here, he put it in
our heads


Is he mad? Now heaven increase his madness, and bless it,


Have you a warrant? an' you have a warrant, show it.


Yes, I have a warrant out of the word, to give thanks for removing any scorn
intended to the brethren


It is Justice Ouerdoo's warrant, that I look for, if you have not that, keep
your word, I Will keep mine. Quit ye, and multiply ye


COme away Nightingale, I pray thee.


Whither go you? where is your warrant?


Warrant, for what, Sir?


For what you go about, you know how fit it is, an' you have no warrant,
bless you, I Will pray for you,


What means he?


A madman that haunts the Fair, do you not know him? it is marvel he has
not more followers, after his ragged heels


Beshrew him, he startled me: I thought he had known of our plot. Guilt's a
terrible thing! have you prepared the Costardmonger


Yes, and agreed for his basket of pears; he is at the corner here, ready.
And your Prise, he comes down, sailing, that way, all alone; without his
Protector: he is rid of him, it seems


I, I know; I should have followed his Protector-ship for a feat I am to do
upon him: But this offered it self, so in the way, I could not let it escape:
here he comes, whistle, Dorring the Dottrell


Wh, wh, wh, wh, etc.


By this light, I cannot find my ginger-bread-Wife, nor my Hobby-horse-man in
all the Fair, now; to have my money again. And I do not know the way out on it,
to go home for more, do you hear, friend, you that whistle; what tune is
that, you whistle


A new tune, I am practicing, Sir.


Do thou know where I dwell, I pray thee? nay, on with thy tune, I have no
such have, for an answer: I Will practice with thee.


Buy any pears, very fine pears, pears fine.


Gods so! a musse, a musse, a musse, a musse.


Good Gentleman, my ware, my ware, I am a poor man. Good Sir, my ware.





Do, and my cloak, an'thou wilt; and my hat, too.


A delicate great boy! me thinks, he out-scrambles 'hem all. I cannot persuade
my self, but he goes to grammer-schole yet; and plays the trewant, to day


Would he had another purse to cut, Zekiel.


Purse? a man might cut out his kidneys, I think; and he never feel 'hem, he
is so earnest at the sport


His soul is half way out on's body, at the game.


Away, Nightingale: that way.


I think I am furnished for Catherne pears, for one vnder-meale: gi'me my
cloak


Good Gentleman, give me my ware.


Where Is the fellow, I ga' my cloak to? my cloak? and my hat?


Away, Costermonger, come to us to Vrsla's. Talk of him to have a soul?
'heart, if he have any more then a thing given him in stead of salt, only to
keep him from stinking, I Will be hanged before my time, presently, where should
it be trow? in his blood? he has not so much to'ard it in his whole body, as
will maintain a good Flea; And if he take this course, he will not have so
much land left, as to rear a Calfe within this twelve mouth. Was there ever
green Plouer so pulled! That his little Ouerseer had been here now, and
been but tall enough, to see him steal pears, in exchange, for his
beauer-hat, and his cloak thus? I must go find him out, next, for his black
box, and his Patent (it feemes) he has of his place; which I think the
Gentleman would have a reuersion of; that spoke to me for it so earnestly


Fair, Bartholmew-fayre, quoth he; an' ever any Bartholmew had that luck
in it, that I have had, I Will be martyred for him, Smithfield, too. I have paid
for my pears, a rot on 'hem, I Will keep 'hem no longer; you were choake-peares
to me; I had bin better have gone to mum chance for you, I wusse. Me thinks the
Fair should not have used me thus, and 'twere but for my names sake, I would
nor have used a dog of the name, so. O, Numps will triumph, now! Friend, do you
know who I am? or where I lie? I do not my self, I Will besworne. Do but carry
me home, and I Will please thee, I have money enough there, I have lost my self,
and my cloak and my hat; and my fine sword, and my sister, and Numps, and
Mistress Grace, (a Gentlewoman that I should have married) and a cut-worke
handkercher, she ga' me, and two purses to day. And my bargain.
o'Hobby-horses and Ginger-bread,


By whose warrant, Sir, have you done all this?


Warrant? thou art a wise fellow, indeed, as if a man need a warrant to lose
any thing, with


Yes, Justice Ouerdo's warrant, a man may get, and lose with, I Will stand to it.


Justice Ouerdoo? Do thou know him? I lie there, he is my brother in Law,
he married my sister: pray thee show me the way, do thou know the house


Sir, show me your warrant, I know nothing without a warrant, pardon me.


Why, I warrant thee, come along: thou shall see, I have wrought pillowes
there, and cambricke sheets, and sweet bags, too. Pray thee guide me to the
house


Sir, I Will tell you; go you thither your self, first, alone; tell your
worshipful brother your mind; and but bring me three lines of his hand, or
his Clerks, with Adam Ouerdoo, underneath; here I Will stay you, I Will obey you,
and I Will guide you presently


S'lid, this is an Ass, I have found him, pox upon me, what do I talking to
such a dull fool; farewell, you are a very Coxcomb, do you hear


I think, I am, if Justice Ouerdoo sign to it, I am, and so we are all,
he will quit us all, multiply us all


GEntlemen, this is no way that you take: you do but breed one another trouble,
and offense, and give me no contentment at all. I am no she, that affects to be
quarell'd for, or have my name or fortune made the question of men's swords


S'lood, we love you.


If you both love me, as you pretend, your own reason will tell you, but one
can enjoy me; and to that point, there leads a directer line, then by my
infamy, which must follow, if you fight. It Is true, I have professed it to you
ingenuously, that rather then to be yoked with this Bridegroom is appointed
me, I would take up any husband, almost upon any trust. Though Subtilty would
say to me, (I know) he is a fool, and has an estate, and I might govern him,
and enjoy a friend, beside. But these are not my aims, I must have a husband I
must love, or I cannot live with him. I shall ill make one of these politic
wives


Why, if you can like either of us, Lady, say, which is he, and the other shall
swear instantly to desist


Content, I accord to that willingly.


Sure you think me a woman of an extreme leuity, Gentlemen, or a strange
fancy, that (meeting you by chance in such a place, as this, both at one
instant, and not yet of two hours acquaintance, neither of you deserving before
the other, of me) I should so forsake my modesty (though I might affect one
more particularly) as to say, This is be, and name him


Why, wherefore should you not? What should hinder you?


If you would not give it to my modesty, allow it yet to my wit; give me so
much of woman, and cunning, as not to betray my self impertinently. How can I
judge of you, so far as to a choice, without knowing you more? you are both
equal, and alike to me, yet: and so indifferently affected by me, as each of
you might be the man, if the other were away. For you are reasonable creatures,
you have understanding, and discourse. And if fate send me an understanding
husband, I have no fear at all, but mine own manners shall make him a good
one


Would I were put forth to making for you, then.


It may be you are, you know not what is toward you: will you consent to a
motion of mine, Gentlemen


What ever it be, we'll presume reasonableness, coming from you.


And fitness, too.


I saw one of you buy a pair of tables, even now.


Yes, here they be, and maiden ones too, unwritten in.


The fitter for what they may be employed in. You shall write either of you,
here, a word, or a name, what you like best; but of two, or three syllables at
most: and the next person that comes this way (because Destiny has a high hand
in business of this nature) I Will demand, which of the two words, he, or she
does approve; and according to that sentence, fix my resolution, and
affection, without change


Agreed, my word is conceived already.


And mine shall not be long creating after.


But you shall promise, Gentlemen, not to be curious to know, which of you it
is, taken; but give me leave to conceal that till you have brought me, either
home, or where I may safely tender my self


Why that is but equal.


We are pleased.


Because I will bind both your endeavors to work together, friendly, and
jointly, each to the others fortune, and have my self sitted with some means,
to make him that is forsaken, a part of amends


These conditions are very courteous. Well my word is out of the Arcadia, then:
Argalus


And mine out of the play, Palemon.


Have you any warrant for this, Gentlemen?


WIN-W. Ha!


There must be a warrant had, believe it.


For what?


Fot whatsoever it is, any thing indeed, no matter what.


S'light, here is a fine ragged Prophet, dropped down 'ithe nicke!


Heaven quit you, Gentlemen.


Nay, stay a little, good Lady, put him to the question.


You are content, then?


QVAR. Yes yes.


Sir, here are two names written --


Is Iudice Ouerdoo, one?


How, Sir? I pray you read 'hem to your self, it is for a wager between these
Gentlemen, and with a stroke or any difference, mark which you approve best


They may be both worshipful names for ought I know, Mistress, but Adam
Ouerdoo had been worth three of 'hem, I assure you, in this place, that is in
plain english


This man amazes me! I pray you, like one of 'hem, Sir.


I do like him there, that has the best warrant, Mistress, to save your
longing, and (multiply him) It may be this. But I am I still for Justice
Ouerdoo, that is my conscience. And quit you


Is It done, Lady?


I, and strangely, as ever I saw! What fellow is this trow?


No matter what, a Fortune Tellers we have made him. Which is it, which is it.


Nay, did you not promise, not to enquire?


S'lid, I forgot that, pray you pardon me. Look, here is our Mercury come: The
License arriues in the finest time, too! it is but scraping out Cokes his name,
and it is done


How now lime-twig? have thou touched.


Not yet, Sir, except you would go with me, and see it, it is not worth
speaking on. The act is nothing, without a witness. Yonder he is, your man
with the box fallen into the finest company, and so transported with vapors,
they have got in a Northren Clothier, and one Puppy, a Western man, that is come
to wrestle before my Lord Mayor, anon, and Captain Whit, and one Val Cutting,
that helps Captain Jordan to roar, a circling boy: with whom your Numps, is
so taken, that you may strip him of his clothes, if you will. I Will undertake
to geld him for you; if you had but a Surgeon, ready, to sear him. And
Mistress Justice, there, is the goodest woman! she does so love 'hem all
over, in terms of Justice, and the Style of authority, with her hood upright
-- that I beseech you come away Gentlemen, and see it


S light, I would not lose it for the Fair, what'll you do, Ned?


Why, stay here about for you, Mistress Welborne must not be seen.


Do so, and find out a Priest in the mean time, I Will bring the License. Lead,
which way is it


Here, Sir, you are of the backeside of the Booth already, you may hear the
noise


Whit, bid Vall Cutting continue the vapors for a lift, Whit, for a lift.


I Will ne mare, I Will ne mare, the eale's too meeghty.


How now! my Galloway Nag, the staggers? ha! Whit, gi'him a slit in the
forehead. Cheer up, man, a needle, and thread to stitch his ears. I Would cure
him now an' I had it, with a little butter, and garlike, long-pepper, and
grains. Where Is my horn? I Will gi'him a mash, presently, shall take away this
dizzinesse


Why, where are you zurs? do you vlinch, and leave us in the zuds, now?


I Will ne mare, I'is even as vull as a Paipers bag, by my troth, I.


Do my Northern cloth zhrinke in the wetting? ha?


Why, well said, old Flea-bitten, thou wilt never tire, I see.





Who told dee sho? that he vuld never teer, man?


No matter who told him so, so long as he knows.


Nay, I know nothing, Sir, pardon me there.


They are at it still, Sir, this they call vapors.


He shall not pardon dee, Captain, dou shall not be pardoned. Pre'de shweete
heart do not pardon him


S'light, I Will pardon him, an'I list, whosoever says nay to it.


Where Is Numps? I miss him.


Why, I say nay to it.


O there he is!


To what do you say nay, Sir?


To any thing, whatsoever it is, so long as I do not like it.


Pardon me, little man, dou musht like it a little.


No, he must not like it at all, Sir, there you are in the wrong.


I tinke I be, he musht not like it, indeed.


Nay, then he both must, and will like it, Sir, for all you.


If he have reason, he may like it, Sir.


By no meansh Captain, upon reason, he may like nothing upon reason.


I have no reason, nor I will hear of no reason, nor I will look for no
reason, and he is an Ass, that either knows any, or looks for it from me


Yes, in some sense you may have reason, Sir.


I, in some sense, I care not if I grant you.


Pardon me, thou ougsht to grant him nothing, in no shensh, if dou do love die
shelfe, angry man


Why then, I do grant him nothing; and I have no sense.


It Is true, thou have no sense indeed.


S'lid, but I have sense, now I think on it better, and I will grant him any
thing, do you see


He is in the right, and does utter a sufficient vapor.


Nay, it is no sufficient vapor, neither, I deny that.


Then it is a sweet vapor.


It may be a sweet vapor.


Nay, it is no sweet vapor, neither, Sir, it stinkes, and I Will stand to it.


Yes, I tinke it dosh shtinke, Captain. All vapor dosh shtinke.


Nay, then it does not stink, Sir, and it shall not stink.


By your leave, it may, Sir.


I, by my leave, it may stink, I know that.


Pardon me, thou knowesht nothing, it cannot by thy leave, angry man.


How can it not?


Nay, never question him, for he is in the right.


Yesh, I am i would right, I confesh it, so ish de little man too.


I Will have nothing confessed, that concerns me. I am not in the right, nor never
was in the right, nor never will be in the right, while I am in my right mind


Mind? why, here is no man minds you, Sir,


Vreind, will you mind this that we do?


Call you this vapors? this is such beltching of quarrel, as I never heard.
Will you mind your business, Sir


You shall see, Sir.


I Will ne maire, my waimb warkes too mickle with this auready.


Will you take that, Master Waspe, that no body should mind you?


Why? what have you to do? is it any matter to you?


No, but me thinks you should not be vnminded, though,


Nor, I wu'not be, now I think on it, do you hear, new acquaintance, does no
man mind me, say you


Yes, Sir, every man here minds you, but how?


Nay, I care as little how, as you do, that was not my question.


No, noting was ty question, tou art a learned man, and I am a valiant man,
in faith la, tou shall speak for me, and I will fight for tee


Fight for him, Whit? A gross vapor, he can fight for himself.


It may be I can, but it may be, I wu' not, how then?


Why, then you may choose.


Why, and I Will choose whether I Will choose or no.


I think you may, and it is true; and I allow it for a resolute vapor.


Nay, then, I do think you do not think, and it is no resolute vapor.


Yes, in some sort he may allow you.


In no sort, Sir, pardon me, I can allow him nothing. You mistake the vapor.


He mistakes nothing, Sir, in no sort.


Yes, I pre dee now, let him mistake.


A turd in your teeth, never pre dee me, for I will have nothing mistaken.


Whit.


Why, Gentlemen, why Gentlemen, I charge you upon my authority, conserve the
peace. In the Kings name, and my Husbands, put up your weapons, I shall be
driven to commit you my self, else


Ha, ha, ha.


Why do you laugh, Sir?


Sir, you will allow me my christian liberty. I may laugh, I hope.


In some sort you may, and in some sort you may not, Sir.


Nay in some sort, Sir, he may neither laugh, nor hope, in this company.


Yes, then he may both laugh, and hope in any sort, an't please him.


Faith, and I will then, for it does please me exceedingly.


No exceeding neither, Sir.


No, that vapor is too lofty.


Gentlemen, I do not play well at your game of vapors, I am not very good at
it, but --


Do you hear, Sir? I would speak with you in circle?


In circle, Sir? what would you with me in circle?


Can you lend me a Piece, a Iacobus? in circle?


S'lid, your circle will prove more costly then your vapors, then. Sir, no, I
lend you none


Your beard's not well turned up, Sir.


How Rascal? are you playing with my beard?


NOR. Gentlemen, Gentlemen!


Gather up, Whit, gather up, Whit, good vapors.


What mean you? are you Rebels? Gentlemen? shall I send out a Serieant at
Arms, or a Writ o'Rebellion, against you? I Will commit you upon my woman-hood,
for a Riot, upon my Iustice-hood, if you persist


Upon your Iustice-hood? Mary shite o'your hood, you will commit? Spoke like a
true Justice of peace's wife, indeed, and a fine female Lawyer! turd in your
teeth for a fee, now


Why, Numps, in Master Ouerdoo's name, I charge you.


Good Mistress Vnderdoo hold your tongue.


Alas! poor Numps.


Alas! and why alas from you, I beseech you? or why poor Numps, goody Rich? am
I come to be pitied by your tuft taffata now? why Mistress, I knew Adam, the
Clerk, your husband, when he was Adam Scriuener, and writ for two pence a
sheet, as high as he bears his head now, or you your hood, Dame. What are you,
Sir?


We be men, and no Infidells; what is the matter, here, and the noyses? can
you tell


Heart, what have you to do? cannot a man quarrel in quietness? but he must
be put out on it by you? what are you


Why, we be his Majesty's Watch, Sir.


Watch? S'blood, you are a sweet watch, indeed. A body would think, and you
watched well a nights, you should be contented to sleep at this time a day.
Get you to your fleas, and your flocke-beds, you Rogues, your kennells, and lie
down close


Down? yes, we will down, I warrant you, down with him in his Majesty's
name, down, down with him, and carry him away, to the pigeon-holes


I thank you honest friends, in the behalf of the Crown, and the peace, and
in Master Ouerdoo's name, for suppressing enormities


Stay, Bristle, here ish a noder brash o'drunkards, but very quiet, special
drunkards, will pay dee, five shillings very well. Take 'hem to dee, in de
graish of God* one of hem does change cloth, for Ale in the Fair, here, te

Let her sell her hood, and buy a sponge, with a pox to her, my vessel,
employed Sir. I have but one, and it is the bottom of an old bottle. An honest
Proctor, and his wife, are at it, within, if she will stay her time, so


As soon ash tou cansht shwet Vrsh. Of a valiant man I tinke I am the

How now Whit? close vapors, stealing your leaps? covering in corners, ha?

Yes, Captain, though I am Justice of peace's wife, I do love Men of war,
and the Sons of the sword, when they come before my husband


Say thou so Filly? thou shall have a leap presently, I Will horse thee my
self, else


Come, will you bring her in now? and let her talk her turn?


Gramercy good Vrsh, I tanke dee.


Master Ouerdoo shall thank her.


Good Ga'mere Vrs; Win, and I, are exceedingly beholden to you, and to Captain
Jordan, and Captain Whit. Win, I Will be bold to leave you, i'this good company,
Win: for half an hour, or so Win, while I go, and see how my matter goes
forward, and if the Puppets be perfect: and then I Will come and fetch you, Win


Will you leave me alone with two men, John?


I, they are honest Gentlmen Win, Captain Jordan, and Captain Whit, they will
use you very ciuilly, Win, God b'w'you, Win


What Is her husband gone?


On his false, gallop, Vrs, away.


An' you be right Bartholmew-birds, now show your selves so: we are undone for
want of foul in the Fair, here. Here will be Zekiell Edgworth, and three or
four gallants, with him at night, and I have neither Plouer nor Quail for
'hem: persuade this between you two, to become a Bird of the game, while I
work the velvet woman, within, (as you call her.


I conceive thee, Vrs! go thy ways, do thou hear, Whit? is it not pity,
my delicate dark chestnut here, with the fine lean head, large forehead,
round eyes, even mouth, sharp ears, long neck, thin cr^st, close withers,
plain back, deep sides, short fillets, and full flanks: with a round belly,
a plumpe buttocke, large thighs, knit knees, straight legs, short pa^^ernes,
smooth hoofes, and short heels; should lead a dull honest woman's life, that
might live the life of a Lady


Yes, by my fait, and trot, it is, Captain: de honesht woman's life is a scuruy
dull life, indeed, la


How, Sir? is an honest woman's life a scuruy life?


Yes fait, shweet heart, believe him, de leefe of a Bondwoman! but if dou vilt
harken to me, I will make tee a freewoman, and a Lady: dou shall live like a
Lady, as te Captain saish


I, and be honest too sometimes: have her wiers, and her tires, her green
gowns, and velvet petticoates


I, and ride to Ware and Rumford i'dy Coash, sheede Players, be in love vit
'hem; sup vit gallantsh, be drunk, and cost de noting


Brave vapors!


And lie by twenty on'hem, if dou pleash shweet heart.


What, and be honest still, that were fine sport.


Tish common, shweet heart, tou may do it by my hand: it shall be justified
to ty husbands faish, now: tou shall be as honesht as the skin between his
hornsh, la


Yes, and wear a dressing, top, and top-gallant, to compare with ere a husband
on 'hem all, for a fore-top: it is the vapor of spirit in the wife, to
cuckold, now adays; as it is the vapor of fashion, in the husband, not to
suspect. Your prying cat-eyed-citizen, is an abominable vapor


Lord, what a fool have I been!


Mend then, and do every ting like a Lady, hereafter, never know ty husband,
from another man


Nor any one man from another, but in the dark.


I, and then it ish no dishgrash to know any man.


Help, help here.


How now? what vapour's there?


O, you are a sweet Ranger! and look well to your walks. Yonder is your Punque
of Turnbull, Ramping Ales, has fallen upon the poor Gentlewoman within, and
pulled her hood over her ears,


Help, help, in the Kings name.


A mischief on you, they are such as you are, that undo us, and take our
trade from us, with your tuft-taffata hanches


How now Alice!


The poor common whores can have no traffic, for the privy rich ones; your
caps and hoods of velvet, call away our customers, and lick the fat from us


Peace you foul ramping Jade, you --


Od's foot, you Bawd in grease, are you talking?


Why, Alice, I say.


Thou Sow of Smithfield, thou.


Thou tripe of Turnebull.


Cat-a-mountaine-vapours! ha!


You know where you were taw'd lately, both lashed, and slashed you were in
Bridewell


I, by the same token, you rid that week, and broake out the bottom of the
Cart, Night-tub


Why, Lion face! ha! do you know who I am? shall I tear ruff, slit
wastcoat, make rags of petticoat? ha! go to, vanish, for fear of vapors.
Whit, a kick, Whit, in the parting vapor. Come brave woman, take a good heart,
thou shall be a Lady, too


Yes fait, dey shall all both be Ladies, and write Madame. I will do it my self
for them. Do, is the vord, and D is the middle letter of Madame, D D, put 'hem
together, and make deeds, without which, all words are alike, la


It Is true, Vrsla, take 'hem in, open thy wardrope, and fit 'hem to their
calling. Greene-gownes, Crimson-petticoats, green women! my Lord Majors green
women! guests of the Game, true bred. I Will provide you a Coach, to take the
air, in


But do you think you can get one?


O, they are as common as wheelebarrowes, where there are great dunghills.
Every Pettifoggers wife, has 'hem, for first he buys a Coach, that he may
marry, and then he marries that he may be made Cuckold in it: For if their
wives ride not to their Cuckolding, they do 'hem no credit. Hide, and be
hidden; ride, and be ridden, says the vapor of experience


BY what warrant does it say so?


Ha! mad child of the Pye-pouldres, art thou there? fill us a fresh kan, Vrs,
we may drink together


I may not drink without a warrant, Captain.


S'lood, thou'll not stale without a warant, shortly. Whit, Give me pen, ink
and paper. I Will draw him a warrant presently


It must be Justice Ouerdoo's?


I know, man, Fetch the drink, Whit.


I pre dee now, be very brief, Captain; for de new Ladies stay for dee.


O, as brief as can be, here it is already. Adam Ouerdoo.


Why, now, I Will pledge you, Captain.


Drink it off. I Will come to thee, anon, again.


Well, Sir. You are now discharged:


Sir, will it please you, enter in here, at Vrsla's; and take part of a silken
gown, a velvet petticoate, or a wrought smock; I am promised such: and I can
spare any Gentleman a moity


Keep it for your companions in beastliness, I am none of'hem, Sir. If I had
not already forgiven you a greater trespass, or thought you yet worth my
beating, I would instruct your manners, to whom you made your offers. But go
your ways, talk not to me, the hangman is only fit to discourse with you;
the hand of Beadle is too merciful a punishment for your Trade of life. I am
sorry I employed this fellow; for he thinks me such: Facinus quos inquinat,
aequat. But, it was for sport. And would I make it serious, the getting of this
License is nothing to me, without other circumstances concur. I do think how
impertinently I labor, if the word be not mine, that the ragged fellow
marked: And what advantage I have given Ned Win-wife in this time now, of
working her, though it be mine. He Will go near to form to her what a
debauched Rascal I am, and fright her out of all good conceit of me: I should
do so by him, I am sure, if I had the opportunity. But my hope is in her
temper, yet; and it must needs be next to despair, that is grounded on any
part of a woman's discretion. I would give by my troth, now, all I could spare
(to my clothes, and my sword) to meet my tattered sooth-sayer again, who was
my judge i'rhe question, to know certainly whose word he has damned or saved.
For, till then, I live but under a Repreiue. I must seek him. Who be these





You say very well. Come put in his leg in the middle roundell, and let him
hole there


You stink of leeks, Metheglyn, and cheese. You Rogue.


Why, what is that to you, if you sit sweetly in the stocks in the mean time?
if you have a mind to stink too, your breeches sit close enough to your bumm.
Sit you merry, Sir


How now, Numps?


It is no matter, how; pray you look off.


Nay I Will not offend you, Numps. I thought you had sat there to be seen.


And to be sold, did you not? pray you mind your business, an' you have any.


Cry you mercy, Numps. Does your leg lie high enough?


How now, neighbor Haggise, what says Justice Ouerdo's worship, to the other
offenders


Why, he says just nothing, what should he say? Or where should he say? He
is not to be found, Man. He have not been seen in the Fair, here, all this
liue-long day, never since seven a clock in the morning. His Clearks know not
what to think on it. There is no Court of Pie-poulders yet. Here they be
returned


What shall be done with 'hem, then? in your discretion?


I think we were best put 'hem in the stocks, in discretion (there they will
be safe in discretion) for the valor of an hour, or such a thing, till his
worship come.


It is but a hole matter, if we do, Neighbor Haggise, come, Sir, here is
company for you, heave up the stocks


I shall put a trick upon your welsh diligence, perhaps.


Put in your leg, Sir.


What, Rabby Busy! is he come?


I do obey thee, the Lion may roar, but he cannot bite. heathen of the land,
and put a part in the stocks, for the holy cause


What are you, Sir?


One that rejoices in his affliction, and sits here to prophecy, the
destruction of Fayres and May-games, Wakes, and Whitson-ales, and does sigh and
groan for the reformation, of these abuses


And do you sigh, and groan too, or rejoice in your affliction?


I do not feel it, I do not think of it, it is a thing without me: Adam,
thou art above these battries, these contumelies. In te manca ruit fortuna, as
thy friend Horace says; thou art one, Quem neque pauperies, neque mors, neque
vincula terrent,. And therefore as another friend of thine says, (I think it
be thy friend Persius) Non te quaesiueris extra


What Is here! a Stoic in the stocks? the Fool is turned Philosopher.


Friend, I will leave to communicate my spirit with you, if I hear any more of
those superstitious relics, those lists of Latin, the very tags of Rome* and
patches of Popery


Nay, an' you begin to quarrel, Gentlemen, I Will leave you. I have paid for
quarrelling too lately: look you, a device,


Will thou then leave thy brethren in tribulation?


For this once, Sir.


Thou art a halting Neutrall stay him there, stop him: that will not endure the
heat of persecution


How now, what is the matter?


He is fled, he is fled, and dares not sit it out.


What, has he made an escape, which way? follow, neighbor Haggise.


O me! in the stocks! have the wicked prevailed?


Peace religious sister, it is my calling, comfort your self, an extraordinary
calling, and done for my better standing, my surer standing, hereafter


By whose warrant, by whose warrant, this?


O, here is my man! dropped in, I looked for.


Ha!


O good Sir, they have set the faithful, here to be wondered at; and provided
holes, for the holy of the land


Had they warrant for it? showed they Iusticce Ouerdoo's hand? if they had no
warrant, they shall answer it


Sure you did not lock the stocks sufficiently, neighbor Toby!


No! see if you can lock 'hem better.


They are very sufficiently locked, and truly, yet some thing is in the matter.


True, your warrant is the matter that is in question, by what warrant?


Mad man, hold your peace, I will put you in his room else, in the very same
hole, do you see


How! is he a madman!


Show me Justice Ouerdoo's warrant. I obey you.


You are a mad fool, hold your tongue.


Justice Ouerdoo's name, I drink to you, and here is my warrant.


Alas poor wretch! how it earnes my heart for him!


If he be mad, it is in vain to question him. I Will try though, friend: there
was a Gentlewoman, showed you two names, some hour since, Argalus and Palemon,
to mark in a book, which of 'hem was it you marked


I mark no name, but Adam Ouerdoo, that is the name of names, he only is the
sufficient Magistrate; and that name I reverence, show it me


This fellows mad indeed: I am further off, now, then before.


I shall not breath in peace, till I have made him some amends.


Well, I will make another use of him, is come in my head: I have a nest of
beards in my Truncke, one some thing like his





Take Adam Ouerdoo in your mind, and fear nothing.


S'lid, madness it self, hold thy peace, and take that.


Strikest thou without a warrant? take thou that.


We are delivered by miracle; fellow in fetters, let us not refuse the means,
this madness was of the spirit: The malice of the enemy has mocked it self


Mad do they call him! the world is mad in error, but he is mad in truth: I
love him of the sudden, (the cunning man said all true) and shall love him more,
and more. How well it becomes a man to be mad in truth! O, that I might be his
yoake-fellow, and be mad with him, what a many should we draw to madness in
truth, with us


How now! all escaped? where is the woman? it is witchcraft!


WEll, Luck and Saint Bartholmew; out with the sign of our invention, in the
name of Wit, and do you beat the Drum, the while; All the foul in the Fair, I
mean, all the dirt in Smithfield, (that is one of Master Littlewit's
Carwhitchets now) will be thrown at our Banner to day, if the matter does not
please the people. O the Motions, that I Lantern Leatherhead have given light
to, in my time, since my Master Pod dyed! Jerusalem was a stately thing; and so
was Niniue, and the city of Norwich, and Sodom and Gomorrah; Shroue-Tuesday;
but the Gunpowder-plot, there was a get-penny! I have presented that to an
eighteen, or twenty pence audience, nine times in an afternoon. Your
home-borne proiects prove ever the best, they are so easy, and familiar, they
put too much learning i'their things now o'dayes: and that I fear will be the
spoil of this. Little-wit? I say, Mickle-wit! if not too mickle! look to your
gathering there, good man Filcher


I warrant you, Sir.


And there come any Gentlefolks, take two pence a piece, Sharkwell.


I warrant you, Sir, three pence, an'we can.





I wonder where Tom Quarlous is, that he returns not, it may be he is struck
in here to seek us


See, here is our madman again.


I have made my self as like him, as his gown, and cap will give me leave.


Sir, I love you, and would be glad to be mad with you in truth.


How! my widow in love with a madman?


Verily, I can be as mad in spirit, as you.


By whose warrant? leave your canting. Gentlewoman, have I found you? (save
ye, quit ye, and multiply ye) where is your book?


What would you with it, Sir?


Mark it again, and again, at your service.


Here it is, Sir, this was it you marked.


Palemon? fare you well, fare you well.


How, Palemon!


Yes faith, he has discovered it to you, now, and therefore 'twere vain to
disguise it longer, I am yours, Sir, by the benefit of your fortune


And you have him Mistress, believe it, that shall never give you cause to
repent her benefit, but make you rather to think that in this choice, she had
both her eyes


I desire to put it to no danger of protestation.


Palemon, the word, and Win-wife the man?


Good Sir, vouchsafe a yoakefellow in your madness, shun not one of the
sanctified sisters, that would draw with you, in truth


Away, you are a heard of hypocritical proud Ignorants, rather wild, then
mad. Fitter for woods, and the society of beasts th^n houses, and the
congregation of men. You are the second part of the society of Canters,
Outlawes to order and Discipline, and the only priuiledg'd Church-robbers of
Christendom. Let me alone. Palemon, the word, and Winwife the man


I must uncover my self unto him, or I shall never enjoy him, for all the
cunning men's promises. Good Sir, hear me, I am worth six thousand pound, my
love to you, is become my rack, I Will tell you all, and the truth: since you
hate the hyporisie of the party-colored brotherhood. These seven years, I
have been a wilful holy widow, only to draw feasts, and gifts from my
entangled suitors: I am also by office, an assisting sister of the Deacons, and
a deuourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms. I am a special maker of
marriages for our decayed Brethren, with our rich widows; for a third part of
their wealth, when they are married, for the relief of the poor elect: as
also our poor handsome young Virgins, with our wealthy Batchelors, or
Widdowers; to make them steal from their husbands, when I have confirmed them
in the faith; and got all put into their custodies. And if I have not my
bargain, they may sooner turn a scolding drab, in to a silent Minister, then
make me leave pronouncing reprobation, and damnation unto them. Our elder,
Zeale-of-the-land, would have had me, but I know him to be the capital Knave
of the land, making himself rich, by being made Feoffee in trust to deceased
Brethren, and coozning their heirs, by swearing the absolute gift of their
inheritance. And thus having eased my conscience, and vtter'd my heart, with
the tongue of my love: enjoy all my deceits together. I beseech you. I should
not have revealed this to you, but that in time I think you are mad, and I
hope you will think me so too, Sir


Stand aside, I Will answer you, presently. Winwife, is sure of; there is no
expectation for me there! here I may make my self some sauer, yet, if she
continue mad, there is the question. It is money that I want, why should I not
marry the money, when it is offered me? I have a License and all, it is but
razing out one name, and putting in another. There Is no playing with a man's
fortune! I am resolved! I were truly mad, an' I would not! well, come your
ways, follow me, an' you will be mad,


Most zealously, it is that I zealously desire.


Sir, let me speak with you.


By whose warrant?


The warrant that you tender, and respect so; Justice Ouerdoo's! I am the man,
friend Trouble-all, though thus disguised (as the careful Magistrate ought)
for the good of the Republique, in the Fair, and the weeding out of enormity.
Do you want a house or meat, or drink, or clothes? speak whatsoever it is,
it shall be supplied you, what want you


Nothing but your warrant.


My warrant? for what?


To be gone, Sir.


Nay, I pray thee stay, I am serious, and have not many words, nor much time to
exchange with thee; think what may do thee good


Your hand and seal, will do me a great deal of good; nothing else in the
whole Fair, that I know


If it were to any end, thou should have it willingly.


Why, it will satisfy me, that is end enough, to look on; an' you will not gi'
it me, let me go


Alas! thou shall have it presently* I Will but step into the Scriueners,


Why, this mad man's shape, will prove a very fortunate one, I think! can a
ragged robe produce these effects? if this be the wise Justice, and he bring
me his hand, I shall go near to make some use on it.


Look thee! here is my hand and seal, Adam Ouerdoo, if there be any thing to
be written, above in the paper, that thou want now, or at any time
hereafter; think on it; it is my deed, I deliver it so, can your friend write


witness, and all is well.


With all my heart.


Why should not I have the conscience, to make this a bond of a thousand pound?
now, or what I would else


Look you, there it is; and I deliver it as my deed again.


Let us now proceed in madness.


Adam has offered satisfaction! The sting is removed from hence: poor man, he
is much altered with his affliction, it has brought him low! Now, for my other
work, reducing the young man (I have followed so long in love) from the brinke
of his bane, to the center of safety. Here, or in some such like vain place, I
shall be sure to find him. I will wait the good time


HOw now? what is here to do? friend, art thou the Master of the Monuments?


It Is a Motion, an't please your worship,


My fantastical brother in Law, Master Bartholmew Cokes!


A Motion, what is that? Hero, and Leander, otherwise called The Touchstone of
true Love, with as true a trial of friendship, between Damon, and Pithias,
two faithful friends of the Bankside? pretty in faith, what is the meaning on it?
is it an Interlude? or what is it


Yes Sir, please you come near, we will take your money within.


Back with these children;


By your leave, friend.


You must pay, Sir, an' you go in.


Who, I? I perceive thou know not me: call the Master of the Motion.


What, do you not know the Author, fellow Filcher? you must take no money of
him; he must come in gratis: Mr. Littlewit is a voluntary; he is the Author


Peace, speak not too loud, I would not have any notice taken, that I am the
Author, till we see how it passes


Master Littlewit, how do thou?


Master Cokes! you are exceeding well met: what, in your doublet, and hose,
without a cloak, or a hat


I would I might never stir, as I am an honest man, and by that fire; I have
lost all in the Fair, and all my acquaintance too; did thou meet any body
that I know, Master Littlewit? my man Numps, or my sister Ouerdoo, or Mistress
Grace? pray thee Master Littlewit, lend me some money to see the Interlude,
here. I Will pay thee again, as I am a Gentleman. If thou wilt but carry me home,
I have money enough there


O, Sir, you shall command it, what, will a crown serve you?


I think it well, what do we pay for coming in, fellows?


Two pence, Sir.


Two pence? there is twelve pence, friend; Nay, I am a Gallant, as simple as I
look now; if you see me with my man about me, and my Artillery, again


Your man was in the Stocks, even now, Sir.


Who, Numps?


Yes faith.


For what in faith, I am glad of that; remember to tell me on it anon; I have
enough, now! What manner of matter is this, Mr. Littlewit? What kind of Actors
have you? Are they good Actors


Pretty youths, Sir, all children both old and young, here is the Master of'hem
--


Leatherhead, but Lantern.)


Master Lantern, that gives light to the business,


In good time, Sir, I would feign see 'hem, I would be glad drink with the
young company; which is the Tiring-house


Troth, Sir, our Tiring-house is somewhat little, we are but beginners, yet,
pray pardon us; you cannot go upright in it


No? not now my hat is off? what would you have done with me, if you had had
me, feather, and all, as I was once to day? Have you none of your pretty
impudent boys, now; to bring stools, fill Tobacco, fetch Ale, and beg money,
as they have at other houses? let me see some o'your Actors


Show him 'hem, show him 'hem. Master Lantern, this is a Gentleman, that is a
fauorer of the quality


I, the favoring of this licencious quality, is the consumption of many a
young Gentleman; a pernicious enormity


What, do they live in baskets?


Players.


These be Players minors, indeed. Do you call these Players?


They are Actors, Sir, and as good as any, none disprais'd, for dumb shows:
indeed, I am the mouth of'hem all


Thy mouth will hold 'hem all. I think, one Tailor, would go near to beat
all this company, with a hand bound behind him


I, and eat 'hem all, too, an' they were in cake-bread.


I thank you for that, Master Littlewit, a good jest! which is your Burbage
now


What mean you by that, Sir?


Your best Actor. Your Field?


Good in faith! you are even with me, Sir.


This is he, that acts young Leander, Sir. He is extremely beloved of the
womenkind, they do so affect his action, the green gamesters, that come here,
and this is lovely Hero; this with the beard, Damon; and this pretty Pythias:
this is the ghost of King Dionysius in the habit of a scriuener: as you shall
see anon, at large


Well they are a civil company, I like 'hem for that; they offer not to
fleere, nor geere, nor break jests, as the great Players do: And then, there
goes not so much charge to the feasting of'hem, or making 'hem drunk, as to
the other, by reason of their littleness. Do they use to play perfect? Are
they never fluster'd


No, Sir, I thank my industry, and policy for it; they are as well governed a
company, though I say it -- And here is young Leander, is as proper an Actor of
his inches; and shakes his head like an hostler


But do you play it according to the printed book? I have read that.


By no means, Sir.


No? How then?


A better way, Sir, that is too learned, and poetical for our audience; what
do they know what Hellespont is? Guilty of true loves blood? or what Abidos
is? or the other Sestos height


Thou Art in the right, I do not know my self.


No, I have entreated Master Littlewit, to take a little pains to reduce it to
a more familiar strain for our people


How, I pray thee, good Mr Littlewit.


It pleases him to make a matter of it, Sir. But there is no such matter I
assure you: I have only made it a little easy, and modern for the times,
Sir, that is all; As, for the Hellespont I imagine our Thames here; and then
Leander, I make a Diers son, about Puddle-wharfe: and Hero a wench of the
Banke-side, who going over one morning, to old fish-street; Leander spies her
land at Trigsstayres, and falls in love with her: Now do I introduce Cupid,
having Metamorphos'd himself into a Drawer, and he strikes Hero in love with a
pint of Sherry, and other pretty passages there are, of the friendship, that
will delight you, Sir, and please you of Judgment


I Will be sworn they shall; I am in love with the Actors already, and I Will be
allied to them presently. (They respect gentlemen, these fellows) Hero shall
be my fayring: But, which of my fayrin^s? (Le' me see) in faith, my fiddle! and
Leander my fiddle-sticke: Then Damon, my Drum; and Pythias, my Pipe and the
ghost of Dionysius, my hobbyhorse. All fitted


Look yonder is your Cokes gotten in among his play-fellowes; I thought we
could not miss him, at such a Spectacle


Let him alone, he is so busy, he will never spy us.


Nay, good Sir.





Well good Master Lantern, make ready to begin, that I may fetch my wife, and
look you be perfect, you undo me else, i'my reputation


I warrant you Sir, do not you breed too great an expectation of it, among
your friends: that is the only hurter of these things


No, no, no.


I Will stay here, and see; pray thee let me see.


How diligent and troublesome he is!


The place becomes him, me thinks.


My ward, Mistress Grace in the company of a stranger? I doubt I shall be
compelled to discover my self, before my time





Shall we have fine fireworks, and good vapors!


Yes Captain, and waterworks, too.


I pree dee, take a care o'dy shmall Lady, there, Edgworth; I will look to
dish tall Lady my self


Welcome Gentlemen, welcome Gentlemen.


Predee, Mashter o'de Monshtersh, help a very sick Lady, here, to a chair,
to shit in


Presently, Sir.


Vrsla's Ale, and Aqua-vitae ish to blame for it; shit down shweet heart, shit
down, and shleep a little


Madame, you are very welcome hither.


Yes, and you shall see very good vapors.


Here is my care come! I like to see him in so good company;


This is a very private house, Madame.


Will it please your Ladyship sit, Madame?


Yes good man. They do so all to be Madame me, I think they think me a very
Lady


What else Madame?


Must I put off my masque to him?


O, by no means.


How should my husband know me, then?


Husband? an idle vapor; he must not know you, nor you him; there is the true
vapor


Yea, I will observe more of this: is this a Lady, friend?


I, and dat is anoder Lady, shweet heart; if dou hasht a mind to 'hem give me
twelve pence from tee, and dou shall have oder-oder on 'hem


I? This will prove my chiefest enormity: I will follow this.


Is not this a finer life, Lady, then to be clogged with a husband?


Yes, a great deal. When will they begin, trow? in the name of the Motion?


By and by Madame, they stay but for company.


Do you hear, Puppet. Master, these are tedious vapors; when begin you?


We stay but for Master Littlewit, the Author, who is gone for his wife; and we
begin presently


That Is I, that is I.


That was you, Lady; but now you are no such poor thing.


Hang the Authors wife, a running vapor! here be Ladies, will stay for nere a
Delia o'hem all


But hear me now, here ish one o'de Ladish, a shleep, stay till she but
vake man


How now friends? what is here to do?


Two pence a piece, Sir, the best Motion, in the Fair.


I believe you lie; if you do, I Will have my money again, and beat you.


Numps is come!


Did you see a Master of mine, come in here, a tall young Squire of Harrow of the
Hill; Master Bartholmew Cokes


I think there be such a one, within.


Look he be, you were best: but it is very likely: I wonder I found him not
at all the rest. I have been at the Eagle, and the black Wolf, and the Bull
with the five legs, and two pizzles; (he was a Calfe at Vxbridge Fair, two
years agone) And at the dogs that dance the Morris, and the Hare of the
Taber; and mist him at all these! Sure this must needs be some fine sight, that
holds him so, if it have him


Come, come, are you ready now?


Presently, Sir.


Hoyday, he is at work in his Dublet, and hose; do you hear, Sir? are you
employed? that you are bare-headed, and so busy


Hold your peace, Numpes; you have been in the stocks, I hear.


Does he know that? nay, then the date of my Authority is out; I must think no
longer to reign, my government is at an end. He that will correct another,
must want fault himself


Sententious Numpes! I never heard so much from him, before.


Sure, Master Littlewit will not come; please you take your place, Sir, we will
begin


I pray thee do, mine ears long to be at it; and my eyes too. O Numpes, in the
stocks, Numps? where is your sword, Numps


I pray intend your game, Sir, let me alone.


Well, then we are quit for all. Come, sit down, Numps; I Will interpret to
thee: did you see Mistress Grace? it is no matter, neither, now, I think on it,
tell me anon


A great deal of love, and care he expresses.


Alas! would you have him express more then he has? that were tyranny.


Peace, ho; now, now.


Gentles, that no longer your expectations may wander,
Behold our chief Actor, amorous Leander.
With a great deal of cloth lap'd about him like a Scarf,
For he yet serves his father, a Dyer at Puddle wharfe,
Which place we will make bold with, to call our Abidus,
As the Banke-side is our Sestos, and let it not be denied us.
Now, as he is beating, to make the Dye take the fuller,
Who chances to come by, but fair Hero, in a Sculler;
And seeing Leanders naked leg, and goodly calfe,
Cast at him, from the boat, a Sheep eye, and a half.
Now she is landed, and the Sculler come back;
By and by, you shall see what Leander does lack.

Cole, Cole, old Cole.


That Is the Scullers name without control:


Cole, Cole, I say, Cole.


We do hear you.


Old Cole.


Old Cole? is the Dyer turned Collier? how do you sell?


A pox of you manners, kiss my hole here and smell.


Kiss your hole and smell? there is manners indeed.


Why, Cole, I say Cole.


It Is the Sculler you need!


I, and be hanged.


Be hanged; look you yonder,
Old Cole, you must go hang with Master Leander.

Where is he?


Here, Cole, what fayerest of Fayers,
was that fare, that thou landedst but now a Trigsstayres?

What was that, fellow? Pray thee tell me, I scarce understand 'hem.


Leander does ask, Sir, what fairest of Fayers,
Was the fare thhe landed, but now, at Trigsstayers?

It is lo^ely Hero.


Nero?


No, Hero.


It is Hero.
Of the Bankside, he says, to tell you truthwith out erring,
Is come over into Fish-street to eat some fresh herring.
Leander says no more, but as fast as he can,
Gets on all his best clothes; and will after to the Swan.

Most admirable good, is it not?


Stay, Sculler.


What say you?


You must stay for Leander,
and carry him to the wench.

You Rogue, I am no Pandar.


He says he is no Pandar. It Is a fine language; I understand it, now.


Are you no Pandar, Goodman Cole? here is no man says you are,
You Will grow a hot Cole, it seems, pray you stay for your fare.

Will he come away?


What do you say?


I Would have him come away.


Would you have Leander come away? why 'pray' Sir, stay.
You are angry, Goodman Cole; I believe the fair Maid
Came over w' you a' trust: tell us Sculler, are you paid.

Yes Goodman Hogrubber, of Pickt-hatch.


How, Hogrubber, of Pickt-hatch?


I Hogrubber of Pickt-hatch. Take you that.


O, my head!


Harm watch, harm catch.


Harm watch, harm catch, he says: verygood in faith, the Sculler had like to
have knocked you, sirrah


Yes, but that his fare called him away.


Row apace, row apace, row, row, row, row, row.


You are knauishly laden, Sculler, take heed where you go.


Knave in your face, Goodman Rogue.


Row, row, row, row, row, row.


He said knave in your face, friend.


I Sir, I heard him. But there is no talking to these watermen, they will have
the last worcester


God's my life! I am not allied to the Sculler, yet; he shall be Dauphin my
boy. But my Fiddle-sticke does fiddle in and out too much; I pray thee speak
to him, on it: tell him, I would have him tarry in my sight, more


I Pray you be content; you will have enough on him, Sir. Now gentles, I take it,
here is none of you so stupid
but that you have heard of a little god of love, called Cupid.
Who out of kindness to Leander, hearing he but saw her,
this present day and hour, does turn himself to a Drawer.
And because, he would have their first meeting to be merry,
he strikes Hero in love to him, with a pint of Sherry.
Leander is sent her,
who after him, into the room of Hero, does venture.



A pint of sack, score a pint of sack, in the Conney.


Sack? you said but even now it should be Sherry.


Why so it is; sherry, sherry, sherry.


Sherry, sherry, sherry. By my troth he makes me merry. I must have a name for
Cupid, too. Let me see, thou might help me now, an' thou would, Numps, at
a dead lift, but thou art dreaming of the stocks, still! Do not think on it, I
have forgot it: it is but a nine days wonder, man; let it not trouble thee


I would the stocks were about your neck, Sir; condition I hung by the heels
in them, till the wonder were off from you, with all my heart


Well said resolute Numps: but hark you friend, where is the friendship, all
this while, between my Drum, Damon; and my Pipe, Pythias


You shall see by and by, Sir?


You think my Hobbyhorse is forgotten, too; no, I Will see 'hem all enact
before I go; I shall not know which to love best, else


This Gallant has interrupting vapors, troublesome vapors, Whitt, puff with
him


No, I pre dee, Captain, let him alone. He is a Child in faith, la'.


Now gentles, to the friends, who in number, are two,
and lodged in that Alehouse, in which fair Hero does do.
Damon ('for some kindness done him the last week)
is come fair Hero, in Fish-streete, this morning to seek:
Pythias does smell the knavery of the meeting,
and now you shall see their true friendly greeting.

You whore-masterly Slave, you^


Whore-masterly slave, you? very friendly, and familiar, that.


Whore-master in thy face,
Thou have lien with her thy self, I Will proue't in this place.

Damon says Pythias has lien with her, himself, he will prooue't in this place.


They are Whore-masters both, Sir, that is a plain case.


You lie, like a Rogue.


Do I ly, like a Rogue?


A Pimpe, and a Scabbe.


A Pimpe, and a Scabbe?
I say between you, you have both but one Drabbe.

You lie again.


Do I lie again?


Like a Rogue again.


Like a Rogue again?


And you are a Pimpe, again.


And you are a Pimpe again, he says.


And a Scabbe, again.


And a Scabbe again, he says.


And I say again, you are both whore-masters again,
and you have both but one Drabbe again.

Do thou, do thou, do thou?


What, both at once?


Down with him, Damon


Pinke his guts, Pythias:


What, so malicious?
will ye murder me, Masters both, in mine own house?

Ho! well acted my Drum, well acted my Pipe, well acted still.


Well acted, with all my heart.


Hld, hold your hands


I, both your hands, for my sake! for you have both donewell.


Gramercy pure Pythias.


Gramercy, Dear Damon.


Gramercy to you both, my Pipe, and my drum.


Come now we will together to breakfast to Hero.


It Is well, you can now go to breakfast to Hero,
you have given mmy breakfast, with a hone and honero.

How is it friend, have they hurt thee?


O no!

Between you and I Sir, we do but make show.

Thus Gentles you perceive, without any denial,
'twixt Damon and Pythias here, friendships true trial.
Though hourly they quarrel thus, and roar each with other,
they fight you no more, then does brother with brother.
But friendly together, at the next man they meet,
they let fly their anger as here you might see it.

Well, we have seen't, and thou have felt it, whatsoever thou say, what is
next? what is next


This while young Leander, with fair Hero is drinking,
and Hero grown drunk, to any man's thinking!
Yet was it not three pints of Sherry could flaw her.
till Cupid distinguished like Jonas the Drawer,
From under his apron, where his lechery lurkes,
put love in her Sack. Now mark how it works.

O Leander Leander, my dear my dear Leander,
I Will for ever be thy goose, so thou wilt be my gander*

Excellently well said, Fiddle, she will ever be his goose, so he will be her
gander: was it not so


Yes, Sir, but mark his answer, now:


And sweetest of geese, before I go to bed,
I Will swim over the Thames, my goose, thee to tread.

Brave! he will swim over the Thames, and tread his goose, too night, he
says


I, peace, Sir, the'll be angry, if they hear you eaues-dropping, now they are
setting their match


But lest the Thames should be dark, my goose, my dear friend,
let thy window be provided of a candles end.

Fear not my gander, I protest, I should handle
my matters very ill, if I had not a whole candle.

Well then, look to it, and kiss me to boot.


Now, here come the friends again, Pythias, aend Damon,
and under their clokes, they have of Bacon, a gammon.

Drawer, fill some wine here.


How, some wine there?
there is company already, Sir, pray forbear!

It Is Hero.


Yes, but she will not be taken,
after ^acke, and fresh herring, with your Dunmow- bacon.

You lie, it is Westfabian.


Westphalian you should say.


If you hold not your peace, you are a Coxcombe, I would say.


What Is here? what is here? kiss, kiss, upon kiss.


I, Wherefore should they not? what harm is in this? it is Mistress Hero.


Mistress Hero's a whore.


Is she a whore? keep you quiet, or Sir Knave out of door.


Knave out of door?


Yes, Knave, out of door.


Whore out of door.


I say, Knave, out of door.


I say, whore, out of door.


Yea, so say I too.


Kiss the whore of the arse.


Now you have something to do:
you must kiss her of the arse she says:

So we will, so we will.


O my hanches, O my hanches, hold, hold.


Stand'st thou still?
Leander, where art thou? stand'st thou still like a sot,
and not offer'st to break both their heads with a pot?
See who is at thine elbow, there! Puppet Jonas and Cupid.

Vpon'hem Leander, be not so stupid.


You Goat-bearded slave!


You whore-master Knave.


Thou art a whore-master.


Whore-masters all.


See, Cupid with a word has taken up the brawle.


These be fine vapors!


By this good day they fight bravely! do they not, Numps?


Yes, they lacked but you to be their second, all this while.


This tragical encounter, falling out thus to busy us,
It raises up the ghost of their friend Dionysius:
Not like a Monarch, but the Master of a School,
in a Scriueners furred gown, which shows he is no fool.
for therein he has wit enough to keep himself warm.
O Damon he cries, and Pythias; what harm,
Has poor Dionysius done you in his grave,
That after his death, you should fall out thus, and rave,
And call amorous Leander whore-master Knave?

I cannot, I will not, I promise you endure it.


Down with Dagon, down with Dagon; it is I, will no longer endure your
prophanations


What mean you, Sir?


I will remove Dagon there, I say, that Idol, that heathenish Idol, that
remains (as I may say) a beam, a very beam, not a beam of the Sun, nor a
beam of the Moon, nor a beam of a balance, neither a house-beame, nor a
Weauers beam, but a beam in the eye, in the eye of the brethren; a very great
beam, an exceeding great beam; such as are your Stage Players, Rimers, and
Morrise-dancers, who have walked hand in hand, in contempt of the Brethren, and
the Cause; and been borne out by instruments, of no mean countenance


Sir, I present nothing, but what is licensed by authority.


Thou art all license, even licentiousness it self, Shimei!


I have the Master of the Reuell's haud for it, Sir.


The Master of Rebels hand, thou have; Satan's! hold thy peace, thy scurrility
shut up thy mouth, thy profession is damnable, and in pleading for it, thou
do plead for Baal. I have long opened my mouth wide, and gaped, I have gaped
as the oyster for the tide, after thy destruction: but cannot compass it by
suit, or dispute; so that I look for a bickering, ere long, and then a battle


Good Banbury-vapours.


Friend, you would have an ill match on it, if you bicker with him here, though he
be no man of the fist, he has friends that will go to cuffes for him, Numps,
will not you take our side


Sir, it shall not need, in my mind, he offers him a fairer course, to end it
by disputation! have thou nothing to say for thy self, in defense of thy
quality


Faith, Sir, I am not well studied in these controversies, between the
hypocrites and us. But here is one of my Motion, Puppet Donisius shall undertake
him, and I Will venture the cause on it


Who? my Hobbyhorse? will he dispute with him?


Yes, Sir, and make a Hobby-Asse of him, I hope.


That Is excellent! indeed he looks like the best scholar of'hem all. Come,
Sir, you must be as good as your word, now


I will not fear to make my spirit, and gifts known! assist me zeal, fill
me, fill me, hat is, make me full


What a desperate, profane wretch is this! is there any Ignorance, or
impudence like his? to call his zeal to fill him against a Puppet


I know no fitter match, then a Puppet to commit with an Hypocrite!


First, I say unto thee, Idol, thou have no Calling.


You lie, I am called Dionisius.


The Motion says you lie, he is called Dionisius ithe matter, and to that
calling he answers


I mean no vocation, Idol, no present lawful Calling.


Is yours a lawful Calling?


The Motion asks, if yours be a lawful Calling?


Yes, mine is of the Spirit.


Then Idol is a lawful Calling.


He says, then Idol is a lawful Calling! for you called him Idol, and your
Calling is of the spirit


Well disputed, Hobbyhorse!


Take not part with the wicked young Gallant. He neygheth and hinneyeth, all is
but hinnying Sophistry. I call him Idol again. Yet, I say, his Calling, his
Profession is profane, it is profane, Idol


It is not profane!


It is not profane, he says*


It is profane.


It is not profane.


It is profane.


It is not profane.


Well said, confute him with not, still. You cannot bear him down with your
base noise, Sir


Nor he me, with his treble creeking, though he creek like the chariot wheels
of Satan; I am zealous for the Cause --


As a dog for a bone.


And I say, it is profane, as being the Page of Pride, and the waiting woman
of vanity


Yea? what say you to your Tire-women, then?


Good.


Or feather-makers in the Friars, that are of your faction of faith? Are not
they with their perrukes, and their puffes, their fannes, and their huffes, as
much Pages of Pride, and waiters upon vanity? what say you? what say you? what
say you


I will not answer for them.


Because you cannot, because you cannot. Is a Bugle-maker a lawful Calling? or
the Confect-makers? such you have there: or your French Fashioner? you would have
all the sin within your selves, would you not? would you not


No, Dagon.


What then, Dagonet? is a Puppet worse then these?


Yes, and my maine argument against you, is, that you are an abomination: for
the Male, among you, puts on the apparel of the Female, and the Female of
the Male


You lie, you lie, you lie abominably.


Good, by my troth, he has given him the lie thrice.


It is your old stale argument against the Players, but it will not hold
against the Puppets; for we have neither Male nor Female amongst us. And that
thou may see, if thou will, like a malicious purblinde zeal as thou art


By my faith, there he has answered you, friend; by plain demonstration.


Nay, I Will prove, against ere a Rabbin of'hem all, that my standing is as
lawful as his; that I speak by inspiration, as well as he; that I have as
little to do with learning as he; and do scorn her helps as much as he


I am confuted, the Cause has failed me.


Then be converted, be converted.


Be converted, I pray you, and let the Play go on!


Let it go on. For I am changed, and will become a beholder with you!


That Is brave in faith, thou have carried it away, Hobbyhorse, on with the Play!


Stay, now do I forbid, I Adam Ouerdoo! sit still, I charge you.


What, my Brother i'law!


My wise Guardian!


Justice Ouerdoo!


It is time, to take Enormity by the fore head, and brand it; for, I have
discovered enough


Nay, come Mistress Bride. You must do as I do, now. You must be mad with
me, in truth. I have here Justice Ouerdoo for it


Peace good Trouble-all; come hither, and you shall trouble none.


Now, mercy upon me.


Would we were away, Whit, these are dangerous vapors,


Stay, is not my name your terror?


Yesh faith man, and it ish fot tat, we would be gone man.


O Gentlemen! did you not see a wife of mine? I have lost my little wife, as I
shall be trusted: my little pretty Win, I left her at the great woman's house
in trust yonder, the Pig-womans, with Captain Jordan, and Captain Whit, very
good men, and I cannot hear of her. Poor fool, I fear she is stepped aside.
Mother, did you not see Win


If this grave Matron be your mother, Sir, stand by her, Et digito compesce
labellum, I may perhaps spring a wife for you, anon. Brother Bartholmew, I am
sadly sorry, to see you so lightly given, and such a Disciple of enormity: with
your grave Governor Humphrey: but stand you both there, in the middle place; I
will reprehend you in your course. Mistress Grace, let me rescue you out of
the hands of the stranger


Pardon me, Sir, I am a kinsman of hers.


Are you so? of what name, Sir?


Winwife, Sir:


Master Winwife? I hope you have won no wife of her, Sir. If you have, I will
examine the possibility of it, at fit leisure. Now, to my enormities: look
upon me, O London! and see me, O Smithfield; The example of Justice, and
Mirror of Magistrates: the true top of formality, and scourge of enormity.
Harken unto my labors, and but observe my discoueries; and compare Hercules
with me, if thou dare, of old; or Columbus; Magellan; or our country man
Drake of later times: stand forth you weeds of enormity, and spread. First,
Rabbi Busy, thou superlunaticall hypocrite, next, Puppetry, little better then
Poetry: then thou strong Debaucher, and Seducer of youth; witness this easy
and honest young man: now thou Esquire of Dames, Madams, and twelue-penny
Ladies: now my green Madame her self, of the price. Let me vnmasque your
Ladyship


O my wife, my wife, my wife!


Is she your wife? Read te Harpocratem!


By your leave, stand by my Masters, be vncouer'd.


O stay him, stay him, help to cry, Nightingale; my pan,


What Is the matter?


He has stolen gammar Vrsla's pan.


Yes, and I fear no man but Justice Ouerdoo.


Vrsla? where is she? O the Sow of enormity, this!


An' please your worship, I Am in no fault: A Gentleman stripped him in my
Booth, and borrowed his gown, and his hat; and he ran away with my goods,
here, for it


Then this is the true madman, and you are the enormity!


You are in the right, I am mad, but from the gown outward.


Stand you there.


Where you please, Sir.


O lend me a basin, I am sick, I am sick; Ouerdoo? Bridget, call hither my
Adam


How?


Die very own wife, i'fait, worshipful Adam.


Will not my Adam come at me? shall I see him no more then?


Sir, why do you not go on with the enormity? are you oppressed with it? I Will
help you: hark you Sir, in your ear, your Innocent young man, you have taken
such care of, all this day, is a Cutpurse; that has got all your brother Cokes
his things, and helped you to your beating, and the stocks; if you have a mind
to hang him now, and show him your Magistrates wit, you may: but I should think
it were better, recovering the goods, and to save your estimation in him. I
thank you Sr. for the gift of your Ward, Mrs. Grace: look you, here is your
hand and seal, by the way. Mr. Win-wife give you joy, you are Palemon, you are
possessed of the Gentlewoman, but she must pay me value, here is warrant for it.
And honest madman, there is thy gown, and cap again; I thank thee for my
wife. And careful Numps, where is he? I thank him for my license





It Is true, Numps.


I Will be hanged then.


Look in your box, Numps, nay, Sir, stand not you fixed here, like a stake in
Finsbury to be shot at, or the whipping post in the Fair, but get your wife out
of the air, it will make her worse else; and remember you are but Adam, Flesh,
and blood! you have your frailty, forget your other name of Ouerdoo, and inuit
us all to supper. There you and I will compare our discoueries; and drown the
memory of all enormity in your bigg'st bowl at home


How now, Numps, have you lost it? I warrant, 'twas when thou were in the stocks:
why do not speak


I will never speak while I live, again, for ought I know.


Nay, Humphrey, if I be patient, you must be so too; this pleasant conceited
Gentleman has wrought upon my judgment, and prevailed: I pray you take care
of your sick friend, Mistress Alice, and my good friends all --


And no enormities.


I inuit you home, with me to my house, to supper: I will have none fear to
go along, for my intents are Ad correctionem, non ad destructionem; Ad
aedificandum, non ad diruendum: so lead on


Yes, and bring the Actors along, we will ha'the rest of the Play at home.


YOur Majesty has seen the Play, and you
can best allow it from your ear, and view.
You know the scope of Writers, and what store,
of leave is given them, if they take not more,
And turn it into license: you can tell
if we have used that leave you gave us, well:
Or whether we to rage, or license break,
or be profane, or make profane men speak?
This is your power to judge (great Sir) and not
the envy of a few. Which if we have got,
We value less what their dislike can bring,
if it so happy be, to have pleased the King.
