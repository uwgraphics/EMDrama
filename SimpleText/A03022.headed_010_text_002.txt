FIrst the Queens Majesty in the figure of Tethys. The Ladies in the shape of
Nymphs, presiding several Rivers, appropriaten, either to their dignity,
Signiories or places of birth

ON the Trauers which served as a curtain for the first Scene, was figured a
dark cloud, in^erser with certain sparkling stars, which, at the sound of
a loud music, being instantly drawn, the Scene was discovered with these
adornements: First on either side stood a great statue of twelve foot high,
representing Neptune and Nereus. Neptune holding a Trident, with an Anchor made
to it, and this Mot. His artibus: that is, Regendo, and retinendo, alluding to
this verse of Virgill, H^e tibi erunt arts, etc. Nereus holding out a golden
fish in a net, with this word Industria: the reason whereof is delivered after,
in the speech uttered by Triton. These Sea-gods stood on pedestals and were al
of gold. Behind them were two pillasters, on which hung compartments with
other devises: and these bore up a rich Freeze, wherein were figures of ten
foot long, of floods, and Nymphs, with a number of naked children, dallying
with a draperie, which they seemed to hold up, that the Scene might be seen,
and the ends thereof fell down in foldes by the pillasters. In the midst was a
compartment, with this inscription, Tethyos Epinicia, TETHYS feasts of triumph.
This was supported with two winged boys, and all the work was done with that
force and boldness on the gold and silver, as the figures seemed round and not
painted

The Scene it self was a Port or Haven with Bulworkes at the entrance, and the
figure of a Castle commanding a fortified town: within this Port were many
Ships, small and great, seeming to lie at Anchor, some nearer, and some further
off, Zephirus with eight Naydes, Nymphs of fountains, and two Tritons sent
from Tethys to give notice of her intendement, which was the Ante-maske or
first show. The Duke of York presented Zephirus, in a short robe of green
satin imbrodered with golden flowers with a round wing made of lawnes on wyers,
and hung down in labels. Behind his shoulders two silver wings. On his head a
Garland of flowers consisting of all colors, and on one Arm which was out
bare, he wore a bracelet of gold set with rich stones. Eight little Ladies
near of his stature represented the Naydes, and were attired in light robes
adorned with flowers, their hair hanging down, and wauing with Garlands of
water ornaments on their heads

The Tritons wore skin-coates of watchet Taffata (lightened with silver) to show
the Muscles of their bodies. From the waste almost to the knee were finnes of
silver in the manner of bases, a mantle of Sea-greene laced, and fringed with
gold, tied with a knot upon one shoulder, and falling down in foldes behind,
was fastened to the contrary side: on their heads garlands of Sedge, with
trumpets of writhen shells in their hand: Buskins of Sea-greene laid with silver
lace. These persons thus attired, entered with this song of four parts, and a
music of twelve Lutes

YOuth of the spring, mild Zephirus blow fair,
And breath the joyful air,
Which Tethys wishes may attend this day,
Who comes her self to pay
The vows her heart presents,
To these fair complements.
Breath out new flowers, which yet were never known
Unto the Spring, nor blown
Before this time, to bewtifie the earth,
And as this day gives birth
Unto new types of State,
So let it bliss create.
Bear Tethys message to the Ocean King,
Say how she joys to bring
Delight unto his Islands and his Seas,
And tell Meliades
The offspring of his bood,
How she applaudes his good.
The song ended, Triton in the behalf of Zephirus delivers Tethys message with
her Presents (which was a Trident to the King, and a rich sword and skarfe to
the Prince of Wales) in these words

FRom that intelligence which moves the Sphere
Of circling waves (the mighty Tethys, Queen
Of Nymphs and rivers, who will straight appear,
And in a humane Character be seen)
We have in charge to say, that even as Seas
And lands, are graced by men of worth and might,
So they return their favors; and in these
Exalting of the good seem to delight.
Which she, in glory, lately visiting
The sweet, and pleasant Shores of Cambria, found
By an unusual, and most forward Spring
Of comfort, wherewith all things did abound,
For joy of the Inuestiture at hand
Of their new Prince, whose Rites, with acts renownd
Were here to be solemnized on this Strand:
And therefore straight resolves t'adorne the day
With her al-gracing presence, and the train,
Of some choice Nymphs she pleased to call away
From several Rivers which they entertain.
And first the lovely Nymphe of stately Thames,
(The darling of the Ocean) summond is:
Then those of Trent and Aruns graceful streams,
Then Darwent next with cleare-wau'd worthiness.
The beauteous Nymph of Chrystall-streaming Lee
Gives next attendance: Then the Nymph of Air
With modest motion makes her sweet repair.
The Nymph of Seuerne follows in degree,
With ample streams of grace: and next to her
The cheerful Nymph of Rother does appaere
With comely Medway, th'ornament of Kent,
And then four goodly Nymphs that beutifie
Cambers fair shores, and all that Continent
The graces of clear Vske, Olwy, Dulesse, Wy^
All these within the goodly spacious Bay
Of manifold inharboring Mil^ord meet,
The happy Port of Union, which gave way
To that great Heroes HENRY, and his fleet,
To make the blessed conjunction that beg at
A greater, and more glorious far then that.
From hence she sends her dear loved Zephirus;
To breath out her affection and her zeal
To you great Monarch of Oceanus,
And to present this Trident as the seal
And ensign of her love and of your right.
And therewithal she wills him, greet the Lord
And Prince of the Isles (the hope and the delight,
Of all the Northern Nations) with this sword
Which she unto Astraea sacred found,
And not to be vnsheath'd but on just ground.
Herewith, says she, deliver him from me
This skarffe, the zone of love and Amity,
Tingird the same; wherein he may suruay,
Infigur'd all the spacious Emperie
That he is borne unto another day.
Which, tell him, will be world enough to yield
All works of glory ever can be wrought.
Let him not pass the circle of that field,
But think Alcides pillars are the knot
For there will be within the large extent
Of these my waves, and watery Government
More treasure, and more certain riches got
Then all the Indies to Iberus brought,
For Nereus will by industry unfold
A Chimicke secret, and turn fish to gold.
This charge she gave, and looks ^ith such a cheer
As did her comfort and delight bewray,
Like clear Aurora when she does appear
In brightest roabes to make a glorious day.
The Speech ended, the Naydes dance about Zephirus, and then withdraw them
aside, when suddenly at the sound of a loud and fuller music, Tethys with her
Nymphs appears, with another Scene, which I will likewise describe, in the
language of the Architector, who contrived it, and speaks in his own mestier
to such as are vndersta^ders and lovers of that design. First at the opening of
the heavens appeared 3. circles of lights and glasses, one within another, and
came down in a straight motion five foot, and then began to move circularly;
which lights and motion so occupied the eyes of the spectators, that the manner
of altering the Scene was scarcely discerned: for in a moment the whole face of
it was changed, the Port vanished, and Tethys with her Nymphs appeared in
their several Cauernes gloriously adorned. This Scene was comparted into 5.
Neeces, whereof that in the midst had some slender pillowes of whole round,
and were made of modern Architecture in regard of room: these were of
burnisht gold, and bare up the returns of an Architraue, Freeze, and Cornish
of the same work: on which, upon either side was a Plinth directly over the
pillars, and on them were placed, for finishings, two Dolphins of silver, with
their tails wreathed together, which supported ouall vases of gold

Between the two pillars on either side were great ornaments of ^elieuo, the
Basement were two huge Whales of silver. Above in an action mounting were two
Sea-horses, and above them, on each side of Tethys seat was placed a great
Trident The seat or Throne it self was raised six steps, and all covered
with such an artificial stuff, as seemed richer by candle, then any cloth of
gold. The rests for her arms were two Cherubines of gold: over her head was a
great skallop of silver from which hung the foldes of this rich drapery

Above the Skallop and round about the sides was a resplendent freeze of jewel
glasses or lights, which showed like Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, Emralds, and
such like

The part which returned from the two Plinthes that bare up the Dolphines, was
circular, and made a hollownesse over Tethys head, and on this circle were 4.
great C^artuses of gold, which bore up a round bowl of silver, in mannner of a
fountain, with mask-heads of gold, out of which ran an artificial water. On
the midst of this was a triangular basement formed of scrowles and leaves,
and then a rich Veil adorned with flutings, and inchased work with a freeze
of fishes, and a batta^e of Tritons, out of whose mouths, sprang water into
the Bowl underneath. On the top of this was a round globe of gold full of
holes, out of which issued abundance of water, some falling into the receipt
below, some into the Ovall vase, borne up by the Dolphines, and indeed there
was no place in this great Aquatick throne, that was not filled with the
sprinckling of these two natural seeming waters. The Neeces wherein the Ladies
sat, were four, with Pillasters of gold, mingled with rustic stones showing
like a mineral to make it more rock, and Cauern-like, varying from that of
Tethys throne. Equal with the heads of the Pillars was an Architraue of the
same work, above was a circular frontispice, which rose equal with the Bowl
of the fountain fore discribed. On the rustic frontispice lay two great
figures in Rileue, which seemed to bear up a Garland of Sea-weeds: to which
from two antic Candlestickes which stood over the Pillasters were hanging
Labells of gold. And these were the finishings of the top of the two Neeces
next to that of Tethys

In the space between the frontispice and the Architraue stood a great Concaue
shel, wherein was the head of a Sea-god, and on either side the shell to fill
up the room, two great mask heads in perfile. The other two Neeces which were
outermost, were likewise borne up with Pillasters of gold, and for variation
had square frontispices, and against the straight Architraue of the other was
an Arch. All these were mingled with rustic, as before

In the middle between the frontispice and the Arch, was a Bowl or fountain
made of four great skallops, borne up by a great mask head which had likewise
four aspects, and lying upon this Arch (to fill up the Concaues) were two
figures turned half into fishes, these with their heads held up the sides of
this Bowl: above this were three great Cherubines heads spouting water into
the Bowl. On the midst of the square frontispice stood a great vase adorned

The rest of the ornaments consisted of maske-heads, spouting water, swannes,
festons of maritime weeds, great shells, and such like; and all this whole
Scene was filled with the splendour of gold and silver: only some beautiful
colors behind to distinguish them, and to set off the rest

The whole work came into the form of a half round: there sat three Ladies
in each Niece, which made six of a side: the Queen in the midst, and the
Lady Elizabeth at her feet

Now concerning their habit: first their head-tire was composed of shells and
corrall, and from a great Muriake shell in form of the crest of an helm, hung
a thin wauing veil. Their upper garments had the boddies of sky-colored
taffataes for lightness, all embrodered with maritime invention: then had they a
kind of half skirts of cloth of silver imbrodered with gold, all the ground
work cut out for lightness which hung down full, and cut in points: underneath
that, came bases (of the same as was their bodies) beneath their knee. The long
skirt was wrought with lace, waued round about like a River, and on the banks
sedge and Sea-weedes, all of gold. Their shoulders were all imbrodered with
the work of the short skirt of cloth of silver, and had cypress spangled,
ruffed out, and fell in a ruff above the Elbow. The under sleeves were all
imbrodered as the bodies: their shoes were of Satin, richly imbrodered, with
the work of the short skirt

In this habit they descended out of their Cauernes one after another, and so
marched up with winding meanders like a River, till they came to the Tree of
victory, which was a Bay erected at the right side of the state, upon a little
mount there raised, where they offer their several flowers in golden vrnes
which they bare in their hands: whilst a soft music of twelve Lutes and
twelve voices, which entertained the time, expressed as a Chorus, their action in
this manner

WAs ever hour brought more delight
To mortal sight,
Then this, wherein fair Tethys daignes to show
Her, and her Nymphs arow
In glory bright?
See how they bring their flowers,
From out their watery bowers,
To deck Apollos Tree,
The tree of victory.
About whose verdant bows,
They Sacrifice their vows,
And wish an everlasting spring
Of glory, to the Oceans King.
This song and ceremony ended they fall into their first dance, after which
Tethys with draws and reposes her upon the Mount under the tree of victory,
entertained with Musicque and this Song

IF joy had other figure
Then soundes, and words, and motion,
To intimate the measure,
And height of our devotion:
This day it had been showed
But what it can, it does perform,
Since nature has bestowd
No other letter,
To express it better,
Then in this form;
Our motions, soundes, and words,
Tuned to accordes,
Must show the well-set parts,
Of our affections and our hearts,
After this Tethys rises, and with her Nymphs performs her second dance, and
then reposes her again upon the Mount, entertaind with another song

ARe they shadows that we see?
And can shadows pleasure give?
Pleasures only shadows be
Cast by bodies we conceive,
And are made the things we deem,
In those figures which they seem.
But these pleasures vanish fast,
Which by shadows are expressed
Pleasures are not, if they last,
In their passing, is their best.
Glory is most bright and gay
In a flash, and so away.
Feed apace then greedy eyes
On the wonder you behold.
Take it sudden as it flies
Though you take it not to hold:
When your eyes have done their part,
Thought must length it in the heart.
After this song Tethys again arises, and with her Nymphs, takes out the
Lords to dance their Measures Corantos and Galliardes, which done they fall
into their third and retyring dance, wherewith they return again into their
several Cauernes, and suddenly vanish. When to avoid the confusion which
usually attends the desolue of these shows; and when all was thought to be
finished, followed another entertainment, and was a third show no less
delightful then the rest, whose introduction was thus

Zephirus marching a certain space after Tethys and her Nymphs, attended with
his Tritons, a sudden flash of lightning causes them to stay, and Triton
delivers this speech

BEhold the Post of heaven, bright Mercury
Is sent to sommon and recall again,
Imperial Tethys with her company,
Unto her watery Mansion in the maine:
And shift those firmes, wherein her power did daigne
T inuest her self and hers, and to restore
Them to themselves whose beauteous shapes they wore.
And then bowing himself to wards the State, craves their stay, and
prepares them, to the expectation of a return of the Queen and her Ladies in
their forms, with these words

ANd now bright Star the Guidon of this state,
And you great Peers the ornaments of power
With all these glittering troops that have the fate,
To be spectators of this blessed hour.
Be pleased to sit a while, and you shall see
A transfirmation of far more delight
And apter drawn to nature, then can be
Discrib'd in an imaginary sight.
Triton having ended his speech, Mercury most artificially, and in an exquisite
posture descends, and sommons the Duke of York, and six young Noblemen to
attend him, and bring back the Queen and her Ladies in their own form,
directing him to the place where to find them; with this speech

Fair branch of power, in whose sweet feature here
Mild Zephirus a figure did present
Of youth and of the springtime of the year
I sommon you, and six of high descent
T attend on you (a^ hopeful worthyes borne
To shield the Honor and the clear Renown
Of Ladies) that you presently return
And bring back those, in whose fair shapes were shown
The late-seene Nymphs in figures of their own
Whom you shall find hard by within a grove
And Garden of the spring addressed to Jove.
Hereupon the Duke of York with his attendants departing to perform this
service, the loud Musicque soundes, and suddenly appears the Queens Majesty
in a most pleasant and artificial Grove, which was the third Scene, and from
thence they march up to the King conducted by the Duke of York, and the
Noblemen, in very stately manner

And in all these shows, this is to be noted, that there were none of
inferior sort, mixed amongst these great Personages of State and Honor (as
usually there have been) but all was performed by themselves with a due
reservation of their dignity. And for those two which did Personate the
Tritons, they were Gentlemen known of good worth and respect. The introducing
of Pages with torches, might have added more splendour, but yet they would have
pestred the room, which the season would not well permit

And thus have I delivered the whole form of this show, and expose it to the
censure of those who make it their best show, to seem to know: with this
Postscript

Pretulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri
Dum mea delectant mala me, vel denique fallant,
Quam sapere and ringi.
