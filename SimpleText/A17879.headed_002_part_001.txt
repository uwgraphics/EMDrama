FOr as much as this late Entertainment has been much desired in writing,
both of such as were present at the performance thereof, as also of many which
are yet strangers both to the business and place: it shall be convenient, in
this general publication, a little to touch at the description and situation
of Cawsome seat. The house is fairly built of brick, mounted on the
hill-side of a Park, within view of Redding, they being severed about the
space of two miles. Before the Parke-gate, directly opposite to the House, a
new passage was forced through earable-land, that was lately paled in, it being
from the Park about two flight-shots in length: at the further end whereof,
upon the Queens approach, a Cynick appeared out of a Bower, dressed in a
skin-coate, with Bases of green Calico, set thick with leaves and boughs:
his nakedness being also artificially shadowed with leaves; on his head he
wore a false hair, black and disordered, stuck carelessely with flowers

STay; whether you humane be or divine; here is no passage; see you not the
earth furrowed? the region solitary? Cities and Courts fit tumultuous
multitudes: this is a place of silence; here a kingdom I enjoy without
people; my self commands, my self obeyes; Host, Cook, and Guest my self; I
reap without sowing, owe all to Nature, to none other beholding: my skin is
my coat, my ornaments these boughs and flowers, this Bower my house, the
earth my bed, herbs my food, water my drink; I want no sleep, nor health; I
envy none, nor am envied, neither fear I, nor hope, nor joy, nor grieve: if
this be happiness, I have it; which you all that depend on others service, or
command, want: will you be happy? be private; turn Palaces to Hermitages,
noies to silence, outward felicity, to inward content


A stranger on horseback was purposely thrust into the troop disguised, and
wrapped in a cloak that he might pass unknown, who at the conclusion of this
speech began to discover himself as a fantastic Traveler in a silken suit
of strange Checker-worke, made up after the Italian cut, with an Italian hat, a
band of gold and silk, answering the colors of his suit, with a Courtly
feather, long guilt spurs, and all things answerable

Whether travels thy tongue ill nurtur'dman? thy manners show madness, thy
nakedness poverty, thy resolution folly; since none will undertake thy
presumption; let me descend, that I may make thy ignorance know how much it
has injured sacred ears


The Traveler then dismounts and gives his cloak and horse to his Footman,
in the mean time the Cynick speaks

Naked I am, and so is truth; plain, and so is honesty; I fear no man's
encounter, since my cause deserves neither excuse, nor blame


Shall I now chide or pity thee? thou art as miserable in life, as foolish in
thy opinion; answer me; do thou think that all happiness consists in
solitariness


I do.

And are they unhappy that abide in society?

They are.

Do thou esteem it a good thing to live?

The best of things.

Had thou not a Father and Mother?

Yes.

Did they not live in society?

They did.

And were not thou one of their society, when they bred thee, instructing thee
to go, and speak


True.

Thy birth then and speech in spite of thy spleen make thee sociable, go, thou
art but a vainglorious counterfeit, and wanting that which should make thee
happy, contemnest the means; view but the heavens, is there not above us a
Sun and Moon, giving and receiving light? are there not millions of Stars
that participate their glorious beams? is there any Element simple? is there
not a mixture of all things? and would thou only be singular? action is the
end of life, virtue the crown of action, society the subject of virtue,
friendship the band of society, solitariness the breach. Thou art yet young,
and fair enough, were thou not barbarous; thy soul poor wretch is far out
of tune, make it musical, come, follow me, and learn to live


I am conquered by reason, and humbly ask pardon for my error, henceforth my
heart shall honor greatness, and love society; lead now, and I will follow
as good a fellow as the best


The Traveler and Cynick instantly mount on horseback, and hasten to the
Parke-gate, where they are received by two Keepers, formally attired in green
Perpetuana, with ierkins and long hose, all things else being in color
suitable, having either of them a horn hanging formally at their backs, and on
their heads they had green Mommoth-caps, with green feathers, the one of them
in his hand bearing a hooke-bill, and the other a long pike-staffe, both
painted green: with them stood two Robin-Hood-men, in suits of green striped
with black, dressed in doublets with great bellies and wide sleeves, shaped
fardinggale-wise at the shoulders, without wings; their hose were round, with
long green stockings; on their heads they wore broad flat caps with green
feathers cross quite over them, carrying green Bows in their hands, and
green Arrows by their sides

In this space Cornets at sundry places intertaine the time, till the Queen
with her train is entered into the Park: and then one of the Keepers presents
her with this short speech

More then most welcome, renowned and gracious Queen, since your presence
vouchsafes to beautify these woods, whereof I am Keeper, be it your pleasure
to accept such rude intertainment, as a rough Wood-man can yield. This is to us
a high holy day, and henceforth yearly shall be kept and celebrated with our
Country sports, in honor of so Royal a guest; come friends and fellows now
prepare your voices, and present your joys in a Siluan dance


Here standing on a smooth green, and environed with the Horsemen, they
present a Song of five Parts, and withal a lively Siluan-dance of six
persons: the Robin-hood-men feign two Trebles, one of the Keepers with the
Cynick sing two Countertenors, the other Keeper the Base; but the Traveler
being not able to sing, gapes in silence, and expresses his humor in Antike
gestures

DAnce now and sing the joy, and love we owe:
Let cheerful voices and glad gestures show,
The Queen of grace is she whom we receive,
Honor and State are her guides,
Her presence they can never leave.
Then in a stately Siluan form salute
Her ever flowing grace.
Fill all the Woods with Ecchoed welcomes,
And strew with flowers this place:
Let every bow and plant fresh blossoms yield,
And all the air refine.
Let pleasure strive to please our Goddess,
For she is all divine.
Yet once again, let us our measures move,
And with sweet notes record our joyful love.
An object more divine none ever had.
Beauty, and heau'n-borne worth,
Mixed in perfection never fade.
Then with a dance triumphant let us sing
Her high advanced praise,
And even to heaven our gladsome welcomes,
With wings of music raise;
Welcome, O welcome, euer-honoured Queen,
To this now-blessed place,
That grove, that bower, that house is happy
Which you vouchsafe to grace.
This song being sung and danced twice over, they fall instantly into a kind
of Curranta, with these words following

NO longer delay her,
'Twere sin now to stay her
From her ease with tedious sport;
Then welcome still crying,
And swiftly hence flying,
Let us to our homes resort.
In the end whereof the two Keepers carry away the Cynick; and the two
Robin-hood-men the Traveler, when presently Cornets begins again to sound in
several places, and so continue with variety, while the Queen passes through
a long smooth green way, set on each side with Trees in equal distance; all
this while her Majesty being carried in her Caroch

But because some wet had fallen that day in the forenoone (though the
Garden-walks were made artificially smooth and dry) yet all her foot-way was
spread with broad cloth, and so soon as her Majesty with her train were all
entered into the Bower Garden, a Gardener with his Man and Boy, issued out of an
Arbor to give her Highness entertainment: The Gardener was suited in gray with
a ierkin double iagged all about the wings and skirts, he had a pair of great
slops with a cod-peece, and buttoned Gamachios all of the same stuff, on his
head he had a strawne hat, pibaldly dressed with flowers, and in his hand a
siluered spade: His man was also suited in gray with a great buttoned flap on
his ierkin, having large wings and skirts, with a pair of great slops and
Gamachios of the same, on his head he had a strawne hat, and in his hand a
siluered Mattox: The Gardiners Boy was in a pretty suit of flowrie stuff,
with a siluered Rake in his hand: when they approached near the Queen, they
all valed Bonet, and lowting low, the Gardner began after his anticke fashion
this speech

Most magnificent and peerless Diety, lo I the surueyer of Lady Floras
works, welcome your grace with fragrant phrases into her Bowers, beseeching
your greatness to bear with the late wooden entertainment of the Wood-men,
for Woods are more full of weeds then wits, but gardens are weeded, and
Gardners witty, as may appear by me. I have flowers for all fancies, Time for
truth, Rosemary for remembrance, Roses for love, Hartsease for joy, and
thousands more, which all harmoniously rejoice at your presence; but my self,
with these my Paradisians here, will make you such music, as the wild
Wooddists shall be ashamed to hear the report of it. Come sirs prune your
pipes, and tune your strings, and agree together like birds of a feather


VVElcome to this flowrie place,
Fair Goddess and sole Queen of grace:
All eyes triumph in your sight,
Which through all this empty space
Casts such glorious beams of light.
Paradise were meeter far
To entertain so bright a Star:
But why erres my folly so?
Paradise is where you are
Heaven above, and heaven below.
Could our powers and wishes meet,
How well would they your graces greet,
Yet accept of our desire,
Roses of all flowers most sweet
Spring out of the silly brier.
After this song, the Gardener speaks again.

Wonder not (great Goddess) at the sweetness of our Garden-aire (though
passing sweet it be) Flora has perfumed it for you (Flora our mistress, and
your servant) who enuites you yet further into her Paradise; she inuisibly
will lead your grace the way, and we (as our duty is) visibly stay behind


From thence the Queen ascends by a few steps into the upper Garden, at the
end whereof, near the house, this Song was sung by an excellent counter-tenor
voice, with rare variety of division unto two unusual instruments, all being
concealed within the Arbor

O Joys exceeding?
From love, from power of your wished sight proceeding!
As a fair morn shines divinely,
Such is your view, appearing more divinely.
Your steps ascending,
Raise high your thoughts for your content contending;
All our hearts of this grace vaunting,
Now leap as they were moved by inchaunting.
So ended the entertainment without the House for that time, and the Queens
pleasure being that night to suppe privately: The Kings Violins attended her
with their sollemnest music, as an excellent consort in like manner did the
next day at dinner

Supper being ended, her Majesty accompanied with many Lords and Ladies came
into the Hall, and rested Her self in Her Chair of State, the Scaffoldes of
the Hall being on all parts filled with heholders of worth, suddenly forth
came the Traveler, Gardener, Cynicke, with the rest of their crew, and others
furnished with their Instruments, and in manner following entertain the time

A Hall, a hall for men of moment; Rationals, and Irrationals; but yet not all
of one breeding. For I an Academicke am, refined by travel that have learned
what to Courtship belongs, and so divine a presence as this; if we press past
good manners, laugh at our follies, for you cannot show us more favor, then to
laugh at us. If we prove ridiculous in your sights, we are gracious; and
therefore we beseech you to laugh at us. For mine own part (I thank my
Stars for it) I have been laughed at in most parts of Christendom


I can neither brag of my Travels, nor yet am ashamed of my profession; I
make sweet walks for fair Ladies; Flowers I prepare to adorn them; close
Arbours I build wherein their Loves unseen may court them; and who can do
Ladies better service, or more acceptable? when I was a Child and lay in my
Cradle, (a very pretty Child) I remember well that Lady Venus appeared unto me,
and setting a Silver Spade and Rake by my Pillow, bad me prove a Gardener; I
told my Mother of it (as became the duty of a good Child) whereupon she
provided straight for me two great Platters full of Pappe; which having
duetifully devoured, I grew to this portrature you see, sprung fodainely out of
my Cabine, and fell to my profession


Verily by thy discourse thou have Traveled much, and I am ashamed of my self
that I come so far behind thee; as not once to have yet mentioned Venus or
Cupid, or any other of the gods to have appeared to me. But I will henceforth
boast truly, that I have now seen a Dietie as far beyond theirs, as the
beauty of light is beyond darkness, or this Feast whereof we have had our
share, is beyond thy Sallets


Sure I am, it has stirred up strange thoughts in me; never knew I the
difference between Wine and Water before. Bacchus has opened mine eyes, I now
see bravery and admire it, beauty and adore it. I find my Arms naked, my
discourse rude, but my heart soft as Wax, ready to melt with the least beam
of a fair eye; which (till this time) was as intractable as Iron


I much joy in thy conversion, thou have long been a mad fellow, and now
proues^ a good fellow, let us all therefore join together sociably in a Song,
to the honor of good fellowship


A very Musical motion, and I agree to it.

Sing that sing can, for my part I will only while you sing, keep time with
my gestures. A la more du France


NIght as well as brightest day has her delight,
Let us then with mirth and Music deck the night,
Never did glad day such store
Of joy to night boqueath.
Her Stars then adore,
Both in Heaven, and hoar beneath.
Love and beauty, mirth and Music yield true joys,
Though the Cynickes in their folly count them toys.
Raise your spirits nere so high,
They will be apt to fall:
None brave thoughts envy,
Who had ere brave thought at all.
Joy is the sweet friend of life, the nurse of blood,
Patron of all health, and fountain of all good:
Never may joy hence depart,
But all your thoughts attend,
Naught can hurt the heart,
That retains so sweet a friend.
At the end of this Song, enters Siluanus, shapt after the description of the
ancient Writers; His lower parts like a Goat, and his upper parts in an
anticke habit of rich Taffatie, cut into Leaves, and on his head he had a false
Hair, with a wreath of long Boughs and Lillies, that hung dangling about his
neck, and in his hand a Cypress branch, in memory of his love Cyparissus,
The Gardener espying him speaks thus

Silence sirs, here comes Siluanus god of these Woods, whose presence is rare,
and importes some novelty


Let us give place, for this place is fitter for Dieties then us.


They all vanish and leave Siluanus alone, who coming nearer to the State, and
making a low Congee, speaks

THat health which harbors in the fresh air'd groves,
Those pleasures which green hill and valley moves,
Siluanus the commander of them all,
Here offers to this State Imperial;
Which as a homager he visites now,
And to a greater power his power does bow,
With all, thus much his duty signifies:
That there are certain Semideities,
Belonging to his Siluan walks, who come
Led with the Music of a Spritely drome,
To keep the night awake and honor you,
(Great Queen) to whom all Honors they hold due,
So rest you full of joy, and wished content,
Which though it be not given, it is fairly meant.

At the end of this speech there is suddenly heard a great noise of drums and
phifes, and way being made, eight Pages first enter, with green torches in
their hands lighted; their suits were of green Satin, with cloakes and caps
of the same, richly and strangely set forth: Presently after them the eight
Maskers came, in rich imbrodered suits of green Satin with high hats of the
same, and all their acoutrements answerable to such Noble and Princely
personages, as they concealed under their visards, and so they instantly fell
into a new dance: at the end whereof they took forth the Ladies, and danced
with them, and so well was the Queen pleased with her intertainment, that she
vouchsafed to make her self the head of their Revels, and graciously to adorn
the place with her personal dancing: much of the night being thus spent with
variety of dances, the Maskers made a conclusion with a second new dance

At the Queens parting on wednesday in the afternoon, the Gardener with his
Man and Boy and three handsome Country Maids, the one bearing a rich bag
with linen in it, the second a rich apron, and the third a rich mantle,
appear all out of an Arbor in the lower Garden, and meeting the Queen, the
Gardener presents this speech

STay Goddess, stay a little space,
Our poor Country love to grace,
Since we dare not too long stay you,
Accept at our hands, we pray you,
These mean presents to express
Greater love, then we profess,
Or can utter now for woe
Of your parting hast'ned so.
Gifts these are, such as were wrought
By their hands, that them have brought,
Homebred things, which they presumed,
After I had them perfumed
With my flowrie incantation,
To give you in presentation
At your parting, come feate Lasses
With fine cursies, and smooth faces,
Offer up your simple toys
To the Mistress of our joys;
While we the sad time prolong
With a mournful parting song.

CAn you the Author of our joy
So soon depart?
Will you revive, and straight destroy,
New mirth to tears convert?
O that ever cause of gladness
Should so swiftly turn to sadness!
Now as we droupe, so will these flowers
Bard of your sight.
Nothing avail them heavenly showers
Without your heavenly light.
When the glorious Sun forsakes us,
Winter quickly ouer-takes us.
Yet shall our prayers your ways attend,
When you are gone;
And we the tedious time will spend,
Remembering you alone.
Welcome here shall you hear ever,
But the word of parting never.
