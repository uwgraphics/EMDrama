BE not deceived, I have no bended knees,
No supple tongue, nor speeches steeped in Oil,
No candied flattery, nor honied words.
I come an armed Prologue: armed with Arts,
Who by my sacred charms and mystic skill,
By virtue of this all-commanding Wand
Stolen from the sleepy Mercury, will raise
From black Abyss and sutty hell, that mirth
Which fits this learned round. Thou long-dead Show,
Break from thy Marble prison, sleep no more
In myrie darkness, henceforth I forbid thee
To bathe in Lethe's muddy waves, ascend
As bright as morning from her Tithons bed,
And red with kisses that have stained thy cheek,
Grow fresh again: What? is my power contemned?
Do thou not hear my call, whose power extends
To blast the bosom of our mother Earth?
To remove heavens whole frame from off her hinges,
As to reuerse all Natures laws? Ascend,
Or I will call a band of Furies forth,
And all the Torments wit of hell can frame
Shall force thee up.

O spare your too officious whips a while,
Give some small respit to my panting limbs,
Let me have leave to speak, and truce to parlie,
Whose powerful voice has forced me to salute
This hated air! are not my pains sufficient,
But you must torture me with the sad remembrance
Of my deserts, the Causes of my exile?

It Is thy release I seek, I come to file
Those heavy shackels from thy wearied limbs,
And give thee leave to wa^^e the Stage again,
As free as virtue: Burn thy withered Bays,
And with fresh Laurel crown thy sacred Temples,
Cast off thy mask of darkness, and appear
As glorious as thy sister Comedy.
But first with tears, wash off that guilty sin,
Purge out those ill-digested dregs of wit,
That use their ink to blot a spotless fame,
Let Us have no one particular man traduced,
But like a Noble Eagle seize on vice,
As she flies bold and open! spare the persons:
Let us have simple mirth, and innocent laughter;
Sweet-smiling lips, and such as hide no fangs,
No venomous biting teeth, or forked tongues,
Then shall thy freedom be restored again,
And full applause be wages of thy pain.

Then from the depth of truth I here protest,
I do disclaim all petulant hate and malice,
I will not touch such men as I know vicious,
Much less the good: I will not dare to say
That such a one paid for his fellowship,
And had no learning but in's purse; no Officer
Need fear the sting of my detraction,
I Will give all lcaue to fill their guts in quiet:
I make no dangerous Almanacks, no gulls,
No posts with envious News and biting Packets,
You need not fear this Show, you that are bad,
It is no Parliament: you that nothing have
Like Scholars, but a Beard and Gown, for me
May pass for good grand Sophies: all my skill
Shall beg but honest laughter and such smiles
As might become a Cato: I shall give
No cause to grieve, that once more yet I live.

Go then, and you Beadles of hell auaunt,
Return to your eternal plagues.

Here, take these purer robes, and clad in these,
Be thou all glorious and instruct thy mirth
With thy sweet temper, whilst my self entreat
Thy friends that long lamented thy sad fates,
To sit and taste, and to accept thy Cates.

Sit, see, and hear, and censure he that will,
I come to have my mirth approved, not skill:
Your laughter all I beg, and where you see
No jest worth laughing at, faith laugh at me.

SEcundum gradum compossibilitatis, and non secundum gradum
incompossibilitatis. What should this Scotus mean by his possibilities and
incompossibilities? my Cooper, Rider, Thomas, and Minshew are as far to seek
as my self: not a word of compossibilitas or incompossibilitas is there. Well,
I know what I Will do. I have heard of a great Philosopher: I Will try what he can
do; They call him Aristippus, Aristippus, Aristippus: sure a Philosophers
name. But they say he lies at the Dolphin, and that me thinks is an ill sign:
yet they say too, the best Philosophers of the town never lie from thence:
they say it is a Tavern too; for my part I cannot tell, I know no part of the
Town but the Schools and Aristotle's Well: but since I am come thus far, I
will enquire: for this same compossibilitas and incompossibilitas sticks in my
stomach


Anon, Anon Sir.

What Philosophy is this?

Anon, Anon Sir.

Please you see a Room Sir? what would you have Sir?

Nothing but Aristippus.

You shall Sir.

What is this? the Dolphin? now verily it looks like a Green Fish: what is
yonder Greek too? Now surely it is the Philosophers Motto: Hippathi-happathi;
aut disce, aut discede incontinenter, a very good disjunction


A pint of Aristippus to the Bar.

Here Sir.

Ha? what is this?

Did you not ask for Aristippus Sir?

The great Philosopher lately come hither.

Why, this is Aristippus.

Verily then Aristippus is duplex, Nominalis and Realis; or else the
Philosopher lives like Diogenes in dolio: the President of Hogges-head
College: but I mean one Aristippus (...) the great Philosopher


I know not what you mean by Losopher, but here be Scholars in the house,
I Will send them to you: Anon, anon Sir, I cannot be here and there too. Anon,
anon Sir


This boy would have put a fallacy upon me, in Interrogatione plurium. This
boy is a mere Animal; ha, ha, he. He has not a jot of Language in him more
then Anon, anon, Sir. O Giggleswicke, thou happy place of education! This poor
wretch knows not what a Philosopher means. To see the simpleness of these
people; They do ever thing (...), and have not a jot, not an inch of (...) in
them. O what had become of me, if I had not gone barefoot to my Praeceptor,
with a Satchell at my back

Slaves are they that heap up mountains,
Still desiring more and more,
Still let us carouse in Bacchus fountains,
Never dreaming to be poor,
Give us then a Cup of liquor,
Fill it up unto the brim,
For then me thinks my wits grow quicker,
When my brains in liquor swim.
Ha brave Arstippus.
Pox of Aristotle and Plato, and a company of dry Raskalls:
But hey brave Aristippus.

Certainly, there are Aristippus his Scholiers: Sir, pray can you resolve me
what is Gradus compossibilitatis


What ailes thou, thou musing man?
Diddle diddle do.

Quench thy sorrows in a Can,
Diddle diddle do.
Compossibilitas? Why, that is nothing man, when you never drink beyond your
poculum necessitatis, you are in gradu incompossibili to all good fellowship:
Come, hang Scotus, we will lead you to Aristippus, one Epitome of his in quarto,
is worth a volume of these Dunces


O Gentlemen, you will bind me to thank you in Poculo Gratiarum. But what
Philosophy does he read, and what hours does he keep


None at all precisely, but indistinctly all: Night and day he powers forth his
instructions, and fills you out of measure


He Will make the eyes of your understanding see double, and teach you to speak
fluently, and utter your mind in abundance


Has he many Scholars, Sir?

More than all the Philosophers in the Town besides. He never rests but is
still called for. Aristippus says one, Aristippus says another: He is generally
asked for, yea, and by Doctors sometimes


And as merry a man: There can be no Feast, but he is sent for, and all the
company are the merrier for him


Did you but once hear him, you would so love his company, you would never
after endure to stand alone


O pray help me to the sight of him.

We will, brave boy: and when you have seen him, you will think your self in
another world, and scorn to be your own man any longer


But I pray you at what price reads he?

Why truly his price has been raised of late, and his very name makes him the
dearer


A diligent Lecturer deserves eight pence a Pint tuition: Nay, if you will
learn any thing, Schollerships must be paid for. Academicall Simonie is
lawful: Nay did you ever hear of a good Preacher in a fat Benefice, unless
his purse were the leaner for it? Make much of him, for we shall have no more
such in haste


But who is this?

The University Ramist, a Malt Heretic; alias the Wild man that is grown
mad to see the daily resort to Aristippus: but let us leave him to his frenzi^^

But come you Lads that love Canary,
Let us have a mad fegarie:
Hither, hither, hither, hither,
All good Fellows flock together.
Brains, wits, senses, all sly hence: let fools live limed in Cages: I am
the Wilde-man, and I will be wild: is this an age to be in a man's right wits,
when the lawful use of the throat is so much neglected, and strong drink lies
sick on his deathbed? It Is above the patience of a Malt-horse, to see the
contempt of Barley, and not run mad upon it. This is Aristippus, Aristippus, now
a Devil or two take his rednos'd Philosophy: It Is he, my beer, that has vowed
thee to the Vinegar-bottle; but I Will be revenged: when next I meet him, I Will
twist and twitch his bush-beard from his Tavern face: It Is not his hypathie
happithi can carry him out. Let him look to be sound^^er dashed by me, then
ever he was by Dr^wer for his impudence. I Will teach my Spanish Don a French
trick, I Will either plague him with a Pox, or have some Claret whore burn him
for an heretic, and make him challenge acquaintance of M^ld-Sack^: If he was
not either sent hither from the Britch Politic, or be not employed by Spinola
to seduce the Kings lawful Subjects from their allegiance to strong Beer, let
me hold up my hand at the bar, and be hanged at my Signe-post, if he had not
a hand in the Powder Treason! Well, I say nothing, but he has blown up good
store of men in his days, house and land and all. If they take no order with
him here in the University, the poor Country were as good have the man in the
Moon for their Pastor, as a Scholar. They are all so infected with Aristippus
his Arminianisme, they can preach no Doctrine but Sack and red Noses. As for
the Wilde-man, they have made him horne-mad already

Heighday, there goes the Hunts-vp: this is the Mandrakes voice that vndoe's
me: you may hear him in faith. This is the Devil of his that goes up and
down like a roaring-Sheeps-head to gather his Pewter Library. I Will fit him I
faith

Now you Calues-skin impudence, I Will thresh your Iacket.


What a coyl's here? what fellowe's that? he looks like a mad hogs-head of
March-beere that had run out, and threatened a deluge: what is he


O'tis the Wilde-man sir! a zealous brother that stands up against the
persecution of Barly-broth, and will maintain it a degree above the reputation
of Aquavitae


I have heard him swear by his horaoctaua, that Sack and Rosa Solis is but
Water-grewell to it


O art thou there, Saint Dunstar? thou have undone me, thou cursed Friar Bacon,
thou hellish Merlin: but I Will be revenged upon thee. It Is not your Mephostopho
is, nor any other spirits of Rubie or Carbuncle, that you can raise, nor your
good father in law Doctor Faustus, that coniures so many of us into your Wives
Circle, that with all their Magique, he shall secure you from my rage, you have
set a Spell for any man's coming into my house now


Why, none of my credit has choked up your doors.


But thou have bewitched my threshold, disturbed my house, and I Will have thee
hanged in Gibbets for murdering my Beer: I Will have thee tried by a Jury of
Tapsters, and hanged in Anon anon Sir, thou dismal and disastrous Coniurer


Why do thou call me Coniurer? I send no Fairies to pinch you, or Elues to
molest you: has Robin Good fellow troubled you so much of late? I scarce
believe it, for I am sure, since Sack and I came to town, your house has not
been so much haunted


I Will put out thine eyes, Don Canario, I Will scratch thee to atoms, thou
Spanish Guzman


If he and his Beer will not be quiet, draw vm both out.


Yet I Will be revenged, you rascal, I do not fear the Spanish Inquisition,
I Will run to the Council, and betray thy villainy; I Will carry thee bound for a
Traitor: but for you Sir, we had taken Cales, and might afterward have
conquered Lisbon, and Civil. You notorious villain, I knew thee for a Rogue
at first, thy Ruff looked so like the Moon Crescent in 88. thy very breath is
invincible, and stinckes of an Armado


Kick him out of the presence, his company will metamorphose us to balderdash.


Well Diogen^s, you were best keep close in your tubbe, I Will be revenged on
you; I Will complain on you for keeping ill hours, I suffer noue after eight,
by Saint Iohus, not I


Well Domine, though the hora octaua be not come, yet you may be gone.


Come Pupil, have you any mind to study my Philosophy?


Yes Mehercule Sir, for I have always accounted Philosophy to be omnibus rebus
ordine, natura, Tempore, honor prius; and these Schoolmen have so pusled me,
and my Dictionaries, that I despair of understanding them either in summo
gradu, or remisso. I lay sick of an Ha^ceitas, a fortnight, and could not
sleep a wink for it; therefore good Sir teach me us (...), as you can, and pray
let it be Conceptis vorbis, and exmente Philosophi


I warrant thee a good proficient, but ere you can be admitted to my Lectures,
you must be matriculated, and have your name recorded in A^b^ Academic


With all my heart Sir, and totaliter, for I have as great a mind as materia
pri^^ to be informed with your instructions


Give him the oath.


Lay your hand on the book.


Will tactus virtualis serve the turn Sir?


No* it must be reale quid, and extra intellectum.


Well Sir, I will do it qu^ad poten^iam obedientialem.


First, you must swear to defend the honor of Aristippus, to the disgrace of
Brewers, Alewiues, and Tapsters, and profess your self a foe ^, to Maltmen,
Tapsters, and red Lettices


Kiss the book.


Next, you shall swear to observe the customs and ordinances instituted and
ordained by an Act of Parliament in the reign of King Sigebert, for the
establishing of good government in the ancient foundation of M^er College


Kiss the book.


I Sir, Secundum veritatem intrinsecam, and non equiu^ce.


That you keep all acts and meetings, tam priuatim, in private houses, quam
public, in the Dolphin Schools: that you dispute in tenebris, yet be not
asleep at reckonings: but always and every where show your self so diligent
in drinking, that the Proctor may have no just cause to suspend you for
negligence


Kiss the book.


Lastly, that you never walk into the Town, without your habit of drinking,
the Fudling Cap, and casting Hood; especially when there is a Convocation, and
of all things take heed of running to the Assizes


Is this the end, I pray you Sir, is this the Finis? (...)


It is vltimum Sir.


How pray you Sir, intention, or executione?


(...), that follows the Assizes.


But me thinks there is one Scrupulum, it seems to be actus illicitus, that
we should drink so much, it being lately forbidden, and therefore Contra
formam statuti


I but therefore you are sworn to keep customs, Non omnino secundum formam
statuti


What, have you enrolled him in Albo? have you fully admitted him into the
society, to be a member of the body Academicke


Yes Sir, I am one of your Pupils now, vnitate n^^erica, we have made an end of
it, secundum vltimum Complementum, and actualitatem


Well then, give the attendance.

Most grave audience, considering how they thirst after my Philosophy, I am
iuduced to let you taste the benefit of my knowledge, which cannot but please a
judicious pallat: for the rest I expel them my Schools, as fitter to hear
Thales, and drink Water


We will attend Sir, and that bibulis auribus,


The many errors that have crept into the science, to distract the curious
Reader, are sp^ung from no other causes, then small Beer, and sober sleeps;
whereas were the laudable custom of Sack drinking better studied, we should
have fewer Gowns, and more Scholars


A good note, for we cannot see wood for trees, nor Scholars for Gowns.


Now the whole University is full of your honest Fellows, that breaking loose
from a Yorkshire Belfrey, have walked to Cambridge with Satchels on their
shoulders: these you shall have them study hard for four or five years, to
return home more fools then they came; the reason whereof, is drinking
College taplash, that will let them have no more learning, then they size; nor
a drop of wit more then the Buttler sets on their heads


'Twere charity in him to sconce'vm soundly, they would have but a poor
Quantum else


Others there be that spend their whole lives in Athen^, to die as wise as they
were borne; who as they brought no wit into the world, so in honesty they will
carry none out on it. It Is Beer that drownes the souls in their bodies: H^sons
Cakes, and Paix his Ale has frothed their brains: hence is the whole tribe
contemned, every Prentice can ieere at their brave Cassockes, and laugh the
Velvet Caps out of countenance


And would it not anger a man of Art to be the scorn of a what lake you Sir?


It Is Beer that makes you so ridiculous in all your behavior: hence comes the
Bridelike simpering at a Justice of Peace his Table, and the not eating
methodically, when being laughed at, you show your teeth, blush, and excuse it
with a Rhetorical Husteron Proteron


It Is very true, I have done the like my self, till I have had a disgrace for
my Mittimus


It Is Beer that has putrified our Horsmanship, for that you cannot ride to
Ware, or to Barkway, but your Hackneyes sides must witness your iourneyes. A
Lawyers Clarke, or an Innes a Court Gentleman that has been fed with false
Latin, and Pudding Pie, contemn you as if you had not learning enough to
confute a Nou^rint vniuersi


Per prasentes me Simplicium.


If you discourse but a little while with a Courtier, you presently betray your
learned Ignorance, answering him he concludes not Syllogistically, and asking
him in what Mood and figure he sp^akes in, as if Learning were not as much out
of fashion at Court, as clothes at Cambridge. Nor can you entertain discourse
with a Lady, without endangering the half of your Buttons; all these, and a
thousand such errors, are the friends of Beer, that nurse of Barbarism, and
foe to Philosophy


Oh I am ravished with this admiral Metaphysicall Lecture, if ever I drink
Beer again, let me turn civil Lawyer, or be powdered up in one of Luthers
barrels, pray lend me the book again, that I may forswear it. Fie upon it, I
could love Sir Gyles for presenting those notorious Alewiues. Oh, Aristippus,
Aristippus, thou art equally divine (...) the only father of Quodlibets, the
Prince of Formalities, I ask my Stars whose influence does govern this
^rbem sublunarem, that I may live with thee, and die like the royal Duke of
Clarence, who was sowsed up to immortality in a But of Malmesey


You interrupt him Sir, too much in his Lecture, and prevent your ears of
their hoppinesse


Oh heavens, I could hear him, ad ^ternitatem, and that ^am a part ante quam
a part post. O proceed, proceed, thy instructions are mere. Orthodoxall, thy
Philosophy canonical, I will study thy scieutiam both speculatiuam and
practicam. Pray let me once more forswear the pollution of Beer, for it is an
abominable heretic, I Will be his perfect enemy, till I make him and bottle-Ale
fly the Country


But Sack is the life, soul, and spirits of a man, the fire which Prometheus
stole, not from Jove's Kitchen, but his Wine-Cellour, to increase the native
heat and radical moisture, without which, we are but drousie dust, or dead
clay: this is Nectar, the very Nepenthe the gods were drunk with, it is this
that gave Ganymede, beauty, Hebe youth, to Jove his heaven and eternity; do
you think Aristotle drank Perry, or Plato Cider? do you think Alexander had
ever conquered the world, if he had bin sober? he knew the force and valor of
Sack, that it was the best armor, the best encouragement, and that none could
be a good Commander, that was not double drunk, with Wine and Ambition


Only here is the difference: Ambition makes them rise, and Wine makes them
fall


Therefore the Garrisons are all drinking Schools, the Soldiers trained up to
the mustering of pewter pots daily, learning to contemn death, by accustoming
to be deaddrunke: scarres do not so well become a Captain, as Carbuncles. A
red nose is the grace of a Serieant Mayor, and they unworthy the place of
Ancients that have not good colors, the best shot to be discharged is the
Tavern bill, the best Alarm is the sounding of healths, and the most absolute
March is reeling


And the best Artillery yard is the Dolphin.


Thus you may easily perceive the profit of Sack in military discipline, for
that it may justly seem to have taken the name of Sack from sacking of Cities


Oh wonderful, wonderful Philosophie^ If I be a coward any longer, let me
swear a little to drink Sack, for I will be as valiant as any of the Knights
Errant: I perceive it was only culpa ignorantiae, not pra^ae disposition^s
that made me a coward: but O Enthusiastique, rare, Angelical Philosophy, I
will be a Soldier, a Scholar, and every thing, I will hereafter nec peccare
in mat^rid, nec informd. Beer, raskally Beer was the first parent of
Sophisters, and the fallacies: But proceed, my Pythagoras, my ipse dixit of
Philosophy


Next, it is the only Elixar of Philosophy, the very Philosophers stone, able,
if studied by a young Heir, mu^drererum specus, to change his House, Lands,
Livings, Tenc^^ents, and Liueries into aurum potabile: So that though his
Lordships be the f^wer for it, his manners shall be the more; whose L^nds being
dissolved into Sack, must needs make his soul more capable of divine
meditation, he being almost in the state of separation, by being purged, and
freed from so much earth


Therefore why should a man trouble himself with so much earth? he is the best
Philosopher, that can omnia sua secum portare


And since it is the nature of light things to ascend, what better way, or more
agreeing to nature can be invented, whereby we might ascend to the height of
knowledge, then a light head? A light head being as it were allied with heaven,
first found out, that the motion of the orbs was circular like to its own,
which motions, test Arist^tele, first found that intelligence: so that I
conclude all intelligence, intellect, and understanding to be the invention of
Sack, and a light head; what mists of error had cloaded Philosophy, till the
never sufficiently praised Copernicus found out that the earth was moved, which
he could never have done, had he not been instructed by Sack, and a light
head


Hang me then when I turn grave.


This is the Philosophy, the great Stagirite read to his Pupil, Alexander,
wherein how great a proficient he was, I call the faith of History to witness


It Is true, per sidem Historicam, for I have read how when he had vanquished
the whole world in drink, that he wept there was no more to conquer


Now, to make our demonstration to prove, no wine, no Philosophy, is that
admirable Axiom, in vino veritas, and you know that Sack and truth are the
only Buts which Philosophy aims at


And the Hogshead is that puteus Democriti, from whence they might both be
drawn


Sack, Clarret, Malmsey, White Wind and Hipocras are your five Predicables, and
Tobacco your indiuiduum, your Money is your substance, full cups your quantity,
good wine your quality, your Relation is in good company, your action is
beating, which produces another predicament in the Drawers, called passion,
your quando is midnight, your v^i the Dolphin, your situ^ leaning, your habitus
carousing, afterclaps are your post predicaments, your priorums breaking of
jests, your post^riorums of glasses, false bills are your fallacies, the shot is
subtili^ obiectio, and the discharging of it is, verasolutio, several humors
are your moodes, and figures, where quarta sigura, or gallons must not be
neglected, your drinking is Syllogismes, where a pottle is the mayor terminus,
and a pint the minor, a quart the medium, beginning of healths are the
premises, and pledging the conclusion, for it must not be divided, Topics or
common places are the Ta^ernes, and Hamon, Wolf, and Farlowes are the three
best Tutors in Universities


And if I be not entered, and have my name admitted into some of their books,
let forma misti be beaten out of me


To persuade the Vintner to trust you, is good Rhetoric, and the best figure
is Synechdoche to pay part for the whole, to drink above measure, is a Science
beyond Geometry, falling back-ward is star-gazing, and no lacobs Staff
comparable to a Tobacco pipe, the sweet harmony of good-fellowship, with now
and then a discord, is your excellent music, Sack it self is your Grammar,
sobriety a mere solecisme, and Latin be it true, or be it false, a very
cudgel to your Priscianus pa^es, the r^ckoning is Arithmetique enough, a
receipt of full cups are the best physic to procure vemit, and forget^ing of
debts an art of memory; and here you have an Encuelopoedia of Sciences, whose
method being circular, can never be so well learned, as when your head runs
round


If mine have any other motion, it shall be pr^ter naturam, I, and contra too,
if I li^e: I like that art of music wondrous well, life is not life without
it; for what is life but an harmonious lesson, played by the soul upon the
Organs of the body. O witty sentence! I am mad already, I see the immortality,
ha brave Aristippus: but in Poetry, it is the sole predominant quality, the sap
and juice of a verse, yea, the spring of the Muses is the fountain of Sack,
for to think Helicon a bartell of Beer, is as great a sin, as to call
Pegasus a Brewers Horse


I know some of these halfe-penny Almanac makers do not approve of this
philosophy, but give you most abominable counsel in their Beggars Rhymes,
which you are bound to believes as faithfully, as their predictions of foul
and fair weather, you shall hear some of Erra Paters Poetry

I wish you all carefully,
Drink Sack but sparingly,
Spend your coin t^^ifuly,
Keep your health warily,
Take heed of ^,
Wine is an enemy*
Good is sobriety,
Fly baths and Venery.
For your often potations much crudities cause, by hindering the course of
mother Natures laws, therefore he that desires to live till October, ought to
be drunk in July, but I hold it to be a great deal better that he went to
bed sober. And let him alone, thou man in the Moon, yet had thou but read a
leaf in this admired Author, this aureum flumen, this torrens cloquentiae,
thou would have scorned to have bin of the water Poets Tribe, or Skeltons
family, but thou have never tasted better Nectar than out of Fennors Wassaile
Bowl, which has so transformed him, that his eyes look like two Tunnels, his
nose like a Fausset with the Spicket out, and therefore continually dropping:
the Almanackemakers, and Physicians are alike grand enemies of Sack, as for
Physicians being fools, I cannot blame them if they neglect Wine, and minister
simples, but if I meet with you, I Will teach you another receipt


Why meet him Tutor? you may easily meet him. I know him Sir, and cognitione
distincta and confu^a I warrant you, do you not smell him Tutor? I know who
made this Almanac against drinking Sack? ha Stroffe? have I found you
Stroffe? you will show your self, I see, when all is done, to be but a Brewers
Clarke


But far better speaks the divine Ennius against your Ale, and Barly-broth,
who knew too full well the virtue of Sack, when Nunquam ^isi potus ad arma
prosiluit dicenda; his verses are in Latin, but because the audience are
Scholars, I have translated them into English, that they may be understood.
Here read them


There is a drink made of the Stygian Lake,
Or else of the waters the suries do make,
No name there is bad enough by which it to call,
But yet as I wist, it is ycleped* Ale;
Men drink it thick, and piss it out thin.
Mickle filth by Saint Loy that it leaves wit^in,
But I of complexion am wondrous sanguine,
And will love by the Morrow a cup of wine,
To live in delight was ever my won,
For I was Epicurus his own son,
That held opinion that plainly delight
Was very felicity perfect:
A Bowl of wine is wondrous boon cheer
To make one blyth, buxome and deboneere,
'Twill give me such valor and so much courage,
As cannot be found 'twixt Hull and Carthage.

But above the wit of humanity, the divine Virgil has extolled the Encomium of
Sack in these verses


Fill me a Bowl of Sack with Roses crowned,
Fill't to the brim, I Will have my temples bound
With flowery Chaplets, and this day permit
My Genius to be free, and frolique it;
Let me drink deep, then fully warmed with wine,
Ill' chaunt Aeneas praise, that every line
Shall prove immortal, till my moistened quill
Melt into verse; and Nectar-like distill;
I Am sad, or dull, till bowls brim filled infuse
New life in me, new spirit in my Muse,
But once revived with Sack, pleasing desires
In my childhood kindle such Active fires,
That my gray hayres seem fled, my wrinckl'd face,
Grown smooth as Hebes, youth, and beauties grace,
To my shrunk veins, fresh blood and spirits bring,
Warm as the Summer, sprightfull as the spring,
Then all the world is mine: Croesus is poor
Compared with me, he is rich that asks no more:
And I in Sack have all, which is to me
My home, my life, health, wealth, and liberty,
Then have I conquered all, I boldly dare
My Trophies with the Pelcan youth compare,
Him I will equal, as his sword, my pen
My conquered world of cares, his world of men,
Do not, Atrides, Nestors ten desire
But ten such drinkers as that aged sire,
His stream of ho^yed words flowed from the Wine,
And Sack^ his Counsel was, as he was thine.
Who ^u^r purchased a rich Indiaen mine,
But Bacchus first, and next the Spanish wine?
Then fill my bowl, that if I dye to morrow,
Killing cares to day, I have out-liu'd my sorrow.

Thus resting in the opinion of that admirable Poet, I make this draught of
Sack, this Lectures period


Dixi, do thou say? I, and I Will warrant thee the best Dixi in Cambridge: who
would sit poring on the learned Barbarism of the Scholemen, that by one of thy
Lectures might confute them all, pro and con? I begin to have distinction, and
actualiter, and habitualiter, yet a pox to see, I cannot leave them, nec
principaliter, nec formaliter; yet I begin to love the Fox better than
subtilnesse. Oh Tutor, Tutor, well might Fox be a College Porter, that he
might open the Gates to none but thy Pupils: come fellow Pupils, if I did not
love you, I were (...), and an absurdity in the abstract; Let Us practice, let us
practice, for I Will ^ollow the steps of my Tutor night and day: by this Sack, I
shall love this Philosophy: before I heard this Lecture, Banks his Horse was
an Aristotle; in comparison of me: I can laugh to think what a foolish
Simpli^^us I was this morning, and how learn^dly I shall sleep to night


Sleep to night! why? that is no point of our Philosophy; we must sit up late,
and roar till we rattle the Welkin: Sleep! what have we to do with deaths
Cater-cousin? do you think Nature gave stars to sleep by? have you not day
enough to sleep in, but you must sleep in the night too? it is an arrant
Paradox


A Paradox? let me be crampt if I sleep then, but what, must we sleep in the
day then


Yes, in the morning.


And why in the morning?


Why, a pox of the morning, what have we to do with the sober time of the day?


It Is true, I see, we may learn something of our fellow Pupils, and what must
we do now, fellow pupils? What must we do now


Why? confer our notes.


What is that?


Why? conferring of notes, is drinking off cups, half pots are saying of
parts, and the singing of Catches is our repetition


Fellow Pupil, I Will confer a note with you.


Gramercy brave lad, and it is a good one, an excellent Criticisme; I would not
have lost it for Eustathius and his Bishopric, it is a general rule, and true
without exception


Fellow Pupil, I Will confer a note with you too.


Faith, let me have it, let us share and share like boon Rascals.


I Will say my part to you both.


By my troath, and you have a good memory, you have con'd it quickly Sir.


But what shall we have for repetitions now?


I, what for repetitions?


Why the Catch against the Schoolmen in praise of our Tutor Aristippus: Can
you sing Simplicius


How begins it pray you?


Aristippus is better.


O God Sir, when I was in the state of ignorance, I co^'d it without book,
thinking it had been a Position

Aristippus is better in every letter,
Then Fab^r the Parisiensis,
Then Scotus, Soncinas, and Thomas Aqui^as,
Or Gregory Gandanensis:
Then Cardan and ^amus, then old Paludanus,
Albertus and Gabriella,
Then Pico Mercatus, or Scaliger Natus,
Then Niphus or Zabarella.
Hortado, Trombetus, were fools with Toletus,
Zanardus, and Will de Hales,
With Occham, Ia^ellus, and mad Algazellus,
Philoponus and Natali^,
The Conciliator, was but a mere prater,
And so was Apollinaris:
Iandunus, Plotinus, the Dunc^ Eugubinus,
With Masius, Sauil, and Swarez,
Fonseca, Durandus, Becanus, Holandus,
Pererius, Auienture:
Old Trismigistus, whose volumes have mist us,
Ammonius, Bonauenture,
Mirandula Comes, with Proclus and So^^es,
And Guido the Carmelita:
The nominall Schools, and the College of fools,
No longer is my delighta:
Hang Brirewood and Carter, in Crakenthorps garter,
Let Keckerman too be^oane us,
I Will be no more beaten, for greasy lack Seato^,
Or conning of Sandersonus.
The censure of Cato's, shall never amate us,
Their frosty beards cannot nip us:
Your Ale is too muddy, good Sack is our study,
Our Tutor is Aristippus.

There they be, now for the valor of Brewers, knock um soundly, the old
Rogue, that is he, do you not see him there? soundly, soundly, let him know
what Champions good Beer has

Now let them know that Beer is too strong for them, and let me be hanged, if
ever I be milder to such Rascals, they shall find these but st^le courtesies,
Bellarmine, the golden Legend, or the Turkish Alcharon. I wonder what virtue is
in this p^w^er-faced Author, that it should make every one fall into love with
it so deeply: I'^l try if I can find any Philiru^^, Domine not a drop; O
stultum ingeniur^ hominum, to delight in such vanitie^! Sure these are Comments
upon Tobacco, dry and j^icelesse vanities. I Will try again, by my bonafide,
but this does relish some learning, still better, an admirable witty rogue, a
very flash. I Will turn another leaf, still better, has he any more Authors like
this? what is here, Aristippus? a most incomparable Author, O Bodly, Bodly,
thou have not such a book in all thy Library, here is one line worth the whole
Vatican. O Aristippus, would my brains had been broken out when I broched thy
hogs-head: O cursed Brewers, and most accursed am I, to wrong so learned a
Philosopher as Aristippu^? what penance is enough to clear me from this
impardonable offense? twenty purgations are too little; I Will suck up all my
Beer in Toasts to appease him, and afterward live by my Wife and Hackneyes.
Oh, that I had never undertook this selling of Beer, I might have kept my
house with Fellows Commons, and never have come to this: But now I am a
Wild-man, and my house a Bedlam: Aristippus, Aristippus, Aristippus


How now neighbor Wild-man?


O Aristippus, Aristippus, what shall I do for thee, Aristippus?


What ecstasy is this?


O Aristippus, Aristippus, what shall I do for thee Aristippus?


Why neighbor Wilde-man, disclose your griefs to me, I am a Surgeon, and
perchance may cure vm


O cry you mercy, you are the welcommest man on earth, Sir Signior Medico de
campo, the welcmomest man living, the only man I could have wished for, O
Aristippus, Aristippus


Why what is the matter, neighbor? O I hear he has seduced away your
Parishioners, is this the cause of your Lamentation


O no Sir, a learned Philosopher, one that I love with my soul: but in my rage
I cannot tell you Sir, it is a dismal tale, the sharpest Razor in your shop
would turn edge at it


Never fear it, I have one was sent from a -- faith I cannot think on's name,
a great Emperor, he that I did the great cure on, you have heard on it I am
sure: I fetched his head from China, after it had been there a fortnight
buried, and set it on his shoulders again, and made him as lively, as ever I
saw him in my life; and yet to see I should not think on's name. O I have it
now, Prester John, a pox on it, Prester John, 'twas he, he, I faith, 'twas
Prester John; I might have had his Daughter if I had not been a fool; and have
lived like a Prince all the days of my life; nay, and perchance have inherited
the Crown after his death; but a pox on it, her lips were too thick for me,
and that I should not think on Prester John


O Aristippus, Aristippus, pox on your Prester John Sir, will you think on
Aristippus


What should I do with him?


Why? in my rage Sir, I have almost killed him, and now would have you cure him
in sober sadness


Why call him out Sir.


Sir, yonder comes one of his Pupils.


Salve Mr. Simplicius.


Salve me, it is but a Surgeons complement, Signior Medico de Campo; but you are
welcome Sir, my Tutor wants help. Are you there you Vsquebaugh Rascal, with
your Metheglin juice? I Will teach you Sir to break a Philosophers pate; I Will
make you leave your distinctions as well as I have done


O pardon, pardon me, I repent Sir heartily, O Aristippus, Aristippus, I have
broken thy head, Aristippus, but I Will give thee a plaster, Aristippus,
Aristippus


I pray Sir bring him out in his Chair, and if the house can furnish you with
Barbers provision, let all be in readiness


Pray Sir do you think you can cure him?


Him? why neighbor, do you not remember the Thumb?


What of the Thumb? I have not heard of it as yet Sir.


Why the Thumb, the Thumb, do you not know the cure of the Thumb?


No Sir, but I pray tell the cure of the Thumb, do you still remember't Sir.


Remember't? I, and perfectly, I have it at my fingers end, and thus it is. Two
Gentlemen were fighting, one lost his Thumb, I bychance coming by, took it
up, put it in my pocket, some two months after, meeting the Gentleman, I set
on his Thumb again; and if he were now in Cambridge, I could have his hand to
show for it: why did you never hear of the Thumb Sir? it is strange you never
heard me speak of the Thumb Sir


Signior de Medico Campo, if you have any art or skill, show it now, you never
had a more deserving Patient


Yet I have had many, and royal ones too; I have done Cures beyond Seas, that
will not be believed in England


Very likely so, and Cures in England, that will not be believed beyond seas,
nor here neither, for in this kind, half the world are infidels


The great Turk can witness, I am sure, the eyes that he wears, are of my
making


He was then an eyewitness: but I hope he wears spectacles, Signior.


Why, will not you believe it? why I tell you I am able to say it, I saw't, I saw't
my self, I cured the King of Poland of a Wart on's nose, and Bethlem Gaber of
a Ringworme


The one with raw Beef, and the other with Inkehornes.


Pox of your old Wi^es medicines; the worst of mine Ingredients is an
Unicorns Horn, and a Bezars stone: Raw Beef and Inkehornes! Why, I cured
Sherley in the Grand Sophies Court in Persia, when he had bin twice shot
through with Ordinance, and had two bullets in each thigh, and so quickly, that
he was able at night to lie with his wife the Sophies niece, and beget a whole
Church of Christians; and could this have been done with Raw Beef and
Inkehornes


No sure, this could not have been done without Eggs and Greene-sauce, or an
Oatmeale Poultice at least


The King of Russia had dyed of the worms, but for a powder I sent him.


Some of that you mean, that stuck on the bullet which you took out of
Sherleyes legs


In the siege of Ostend, I gave the Duchess of Austria a receipt to keep her
Smock from being animated, when she had not shifted it of a tweluemoneth


Believe me, and that was a Cure beyond Scoggins Fleas.


I am able by the virtue of one Salve, to heal all the wounds and breaches in
Bohemia


I, and cloze up the Bung-hole in the great Tub at Heidlebergh, I warrant you.


I cured the state of Venice of a Dropsy, the Low Countries of a Lethargy,
and if it had not been treason, I had cured the Fistula, that it should have
dropped no more then your nose. By one Dram on a knifes point, I restored
Mansfield to his full strength and forces, when he had no men left, but was
only skin and bones. I made an Arm for Brunswicke, with so great art and
skill, as nature her self could not have mended it; which had it not come too
late, and after his death, would have done him as much service as that which
was shot off


I easily believe that I faith.


I could make a Purgation, that should so scour the Seas, that never a
Dunkerke durst show his head


By my faith, and that would be a good State Glister.


I have done as great wonders as these, when I extracted as much chastity from
a Sanctimony in the English Nunnery, as cured the Pope of his lechery


And yet had as much left, as served five Cardinals on Fasting-dayes.


And there was no man in the Realm of France, either French or Spanish or
Italian Doctors, but my self, that durst undertake the King of France his
Corns, and afterward having cured him, I drank a health to him


Would we had the pledging on it. O happy man that have conferred a note with
the King of France


And do you seem to misdoubt my skill, and speak of my Art with ifs and
ands? Do you take me for a Mountebank? and has mine own tongue been so
silent in my praise, that you have not heard of my skill


No, pardon us Signior, only the danger our Tutor is in, makes us so
suspicious; we know your skill Sir, we have heard Spain and your own tongue
speak loud on it, we know besides, that you are a Trauailer, and therefore give
you leave to relate your words with authority


Danger? what danger can there be, when I am his Surgeon?


His head Sir is so wondrously bruised, it is almost past cure.


Why, what if he had never an head? am not I able to make him one? or if it
were beaten to atoms, I could set it together, as perfectly as in the womb


Believe me neighbor, but that would be as great a wonder, as the Thumb, or
Prester John's head


Why? I Will tell you Sir, what I did, a far greater wonder then any of these,
I was a Trauailer


There is no such great wonder in that, but what may be believed.


And another friend of mine travailed with me, and to be short, I came into the
Country of Cannibals, where missing my friend, I ran to seek him, and came at
last into a Land where I saw a company feeding on him, they had eaten half of
him, I was very pensive at his misfortune, or rather mine* at last I bethought
me of a powder that I had about me, I put it into their wine, they had no
sooner drank of it, but they presently disgorged their stomachs, and fell
asleep; I Sir, gathered up the miserable morsels of my friend, placed them
together, and restored him to be a perfect man again; and if he were here
still alive, he were able to witness it himself, and do you think I cannot
cure a ten-groates damage, or a cracked Crown


Good Signior make no such delay, cure him, and have one wonder more to fill up
your Legend


Here hold the Basin, you the Napkins, and you Mr Simplicius the Boxes, how
shall we do to lay his feet upon? By my troth Sir, he is wonderfully hurt, his
piam^ter I perceive is clean out of joint; of the 20. bones of the Cranium
there is but three only whole, the rest are miserably crushed and broken, and
two of his Sutures are clean perished, only the Sagitall remains free from
violence, the four Tunicates of his eyes are threadbare, the Meninx of his
^are is like a cut Drum, and the hammers lost: there is not a Ca^tilago in his
head worth three pence, the top of his nose is dropped away, there is not a
Muskle left in the Cauities of his Nostrils, his dentes molares are past
grinding, his Pa^^et is lost, and with it his gurgulio, yet if he can swallow,
I warrant his drinking safe: help open his mouth. So, so, his throat is sound:
he is well I warrant you; now give him a cup of Sack: so let me chafe his
Temples, put this powder into another glass of Sack, and my life for his, he
is as sound as the best of us all: let down his legs. How do you Sir


Why as young as the Morning, all life, and soul, not a dra^^ of body; I am
newly come back from hell, and have seen so many of my acquaintance there,
that I wonder whose Art has restored me to life again


The Catholic Bishop of Barbers, the very Metropolitan of Surgeons, Signior
de Medico Campo


One that has engrossed all Arts to himself, as if he had the Monopoly.


The only Hospital of soars.


And Spittle-house of infirmities, Signior de Medico Campo.


One that is able to undo the Company of Barbersurgeons, and College of
Physicians, by making al diseases fly the Country


Yea, he is able to give his skill to whom he please, by Act of deed, or
bequeath it by Legacy, but he is determined as yet to intaile it to his heirs
males for ever


Sir, death it self dares not anger him, for fear he should beggar the
Sextons by suffering no grave to be made, he can choose whether any shall dye
or no


And he do's't with such celerity, that a hundred pieces of Ordinance in a
pitched field, could not in a whole day make work enough to employ him an
hour; you owe him your life Sir, I Will assure you


Sir I do owe you my life, and all that is mine: think of any thing that
lies in the compass of my Philosophy, and it is your own


I have gold enough Sir, and Philosophy enough, for my house is paued with
Philosophers stones, mine only desire is, that you forgive the rage of this
wildeman, who is heartily sorry for his offense to you


O reverend Philosopher, and Alchimy of understanding, thou very Sack of
Sciences, thou noble Spaniard, thou Catholic Monarch of Wines, Archduke of
Canary, Emperor of the sacred Sherry, pardon me, pardon my rudeness, and I
will forswear that Dutch heresy of English Beer, and the witchcraft of
Middletons water, I Will turn my self into a Gown, and be a professed disciple
of Aristippus


Give him a Gown then, ere we admit him to our Lecture hereafter. Now noble
Signior Medico de Campo, if you will walk in, let us be very iouiall and merry,
it is my second birthday, let us in, and drink a health to the company

We car^ not ^or money, riches, or wealth,
Old Sack is our money, old Sack is our health,
Then let us flock hither
Like Birds of a feather,
To drink, to fling,
To laugh and sing,
Conferring our notes together,
Conferring our notes together.
Come let us laugh, let us drink, let us sing,
The winter with us is as good as the Spring,
We care not a feather
For wind, or for weather,
But night and day
We sport and play,
Conferring our notes together,
Conferring our notes together.

Hark, they are drinking your healths, within, and I must have it too, I am
only left here to offer my supplicat to you, that my grace may pass, and then
if I may but commence in your approbation, I will take a degree in drinking,
and because I am turned a iouiall mad rascal, I have a great desire to be a
Midsummer Batch'lor, I was only stayed to ask your leaves to go out
