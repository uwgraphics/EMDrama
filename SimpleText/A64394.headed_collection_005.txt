PAmphilius took Philumena to wife,
Whom he before time defloured, not knowing who she was,
And he had given her ring, which he had plucked off by force,
To his sweetheart Bacchis a very whore,
Imbrus: he lay not with her after she was married:
Her mother took her home to her self, being great with child,
As if she were sickly. Pamphilus returns,
He finds there is a child born; he conceals it, yet would not
Take his wife again. The father lays blame on his love
(...). With Bacchis: as Bacchis was clearing her self, Myrrhina
The mother of the maid that was defloured, by chance owneth the ring:
Pamphilus takes his wife again with a son.
UXorem duxit Pamphilus Philumenam,
Cui quondam ignorans virgini vitium obtulit,
Ejusque per vim quem detraxerat annulum,
Dederat amicae Bacchidi meretriculae.

Hanc matter utero gravidam, ne id sciat socrus,
Ut aegram ad se transfert. Revertitur Pamphilus,
Deprehendit partum: celat: uxorem tamen
Recipere noluit. Pater incusat Bacchidis
Bacchis, annulum
Matter vitiatae forte agnoscit Myrrhina.
Uxorem recipit Pamphilus cum filio.
HEcyra is the name of this Comedy; when this was first
Acted, a strange fault and misery befell it.
The people being wholly intent upon a rope dancer,
Had so busied their mind, that it could neither be looked at, nor taken
notice on

And he that writ this was not therefore unwilling
To show it again, that he might sell it again.
You have known other Comedies of his; now I pray you approve this.
I come as an humble suitor to you in a Prologues weed*

Being old, which privilege I had being younger,
Who have caused new Comedies that were hissed off the stage, to come into
request again
Lest Poetry together with the Poet should decay.
In those Comedies of Caecilius which I first learned new,

And because I knew that Players fortune on the stage was dubious,
I undertook to my self a certain labor in an uncertain hope;
I began to act the same, that I might diligently learn of him
Other new ones, left I should cause him to forsake his st^die.

They pleased; thus I restored the Poet to his former state,
Who was now almost discouraged by the injury of his adversaries,
From study and pains, and the Art of Po^trie.
But if I had slighted his writing at present, and

That he might rather sit still and do nothing, then employ himself,
I could easily have discouraged him, from writing any other.
Now for my sake consider equitably what I request.
I bring you Hecyra again, which I could never act

Your wisdom will mitigate that misfortune,
If it shall be aiding to our industry.
When I first began to act it, a show of them that went to fistie cuffs,
And the looking upon a rope-dancer befell at the same place:

Caused that I went forth before the time.
I began to use my old custom in a new Comedy,
That I might make tr^^l, I bring it in again;
In the first Act I pleased you, when in the mean time a report comes,

They make a hurly burly, they cry out, and sight for their places;
In the mean time I could not keep my place.
Now there is no stir, all is quisht and silent.
I have now time granted me to Act, you have a power

Do not suffer Poetry through your default,
To come to the use of few; see that your authority
May be favorable and assisting to my authority.
If I never greedily set a price of my Art,

To serve your profit, as much as may be:
Suffer me to prevail, that naughty men may not laugh at him,
Being wickedly circumvented, who has committed his labors
To my defense, and himself to your protection.

That others may have pleasure to write, and it may be profitable for m^
To learn new Comedies hereafter, bought at my own price.
HEcyra est nomen huic fabulae: haec cum data est
Nova, novum intervenit vitium and calamitas,
Ut neque spectari, neque cognosci potuerit;
Ita populus studio stupidus in funambulo
Animum occuparat; nunc haec plane est pernova:
Et is qui scripsit hanc ob eam rem noluit
Iterum refer, ut iterum possit vendere.
Alias cognostis ejus, quaeso ^^^c hanc noscite.
Orator ad vos venio ornatu prologi;
Sinete exorator sim, eodem ut jure uti senem
Liceat, quo jure sum usus adolescentior,
Novas qui exactas feci ut inveterascerent,
Ne cum Poeta scriptura evanesceret:
In his quas primu^ Caecilii didici novas,
Pa^tim sum earum exactus, par^im vix steti;
Quia sciebam dubiam esse fortunam scenicam,
Spe incerta certum mi^i laborem sustuli;
Easdem agere caepi, ut ab eodem alias discerem
Novas studiose, ne illum ab studio abducerem,
Perfeci, ut spectarentur; ubi sunt cognitae,
Placitae sunt, ita Poetam restitui in locum,
Prope jam remotum injuria adve^sarium
Ab studio, atque a labor, atque ar^e musi^a.
Quod si scripturam sprevissem in praesentia, and
In deterrendo voluissem operam sumere,
Ut in otio esse^, potius quam in negotio:
Deterruissem faci^e, ne alias scriberet.
Nunc quid petam, mea causa, aequo animo attendite,
Hecyram ad vos refero, quam mihi per silentium
Nunquam agere licitum est, ita eam oppressit calamitas;
Eam calamitatem vestra intelligentia
Sedabit, si erit adjutrix nostrae industriae.
Cum primum eam agere caepi, pugilum gloria,
Funambuli eodem accessit spectatio;

Fe^ere ut ante tempus exirem fo^as;
Vetere in nova caepi uti consuetudine,
In experiundo ut essem, refe^o denuo;
Primo actu placeo, cum interea ru^^or venit,

Tumultuantur, clamant pugnant de loco:
Ego interea meum ^on potui tutari locum.
Nunc turba nulla est, otium and silentium est,
Agendi tempus mihi datum est; vobis datur

Nolite sinere per vos artem Musicam
Recidere ad paucos; facite ut vestra autoritas
Meae autoritati sautrix adjutrixque sit.
Si nunquam avare statui pretium arti meae,

Quam maxume servire vestris commodis;
Sinite impetrare me, qui in tutelem meam
Studium suum, and se in vestram commisit fidem,
Ne eum circumventum inique iniqui irrideant.

Ut lubeat scribere aliis, mihique ut discere
Novas expediat posthac, pretio emptas meo.
Truly Syra you can find but very few lovers,
Which prove constant to their paramours.
Even this Pamphilus how often did he swear to Bacchis,
And how devoutlie, that any body might easily believe him,
That whilst she lived he would never marry,
Lo he is married.

Therefore because of that I seriously
Both warn and exhort you, that you would not take pi^ty of any man,
But pillage, maim, rend in pieces, whomsoever you get.

Will you that I should have no b^dy exempted?

No body,
For be sure that no one of them comes to you,
But he so prepares himself, that by his flattering speeches
He may satisfy his pleasure at a very small rate.
Will not you I pray you on the other hand seek to beguil these?

Yet indeed it is unreasonable to carry alike toward all.

^ut is it unreasonable to be revenged of our enemies?
Or what way they catch you, that they should be caught by the same?
Ah me poor woman, why have not I
That youth and beauty, or you this resolution?

PEr Pol quam paucos reperias meretricibus
Fidelis evenire amatores, Syra.
Vel hic Pamphilus jurabat quoties Bacchidi,
Q^a^n sancte, uti quivis facile possit credere,

En duxit.

Ergo propterea te sedulo
Et moneo and hortor, ne cujusquam te miserea,
Quin spolies, mutiles, laceres, quemquem nacta sis.

Utin' eximium neminem ha^eam?

Neminem.

Quin ita paret sese, abs te ut ^landitiis suis
Quam minimo pretio suam voluptatem expleat.
H^scine tu amabo non cont^ a insidiabere?

Tamen Pol eandem injurium est esse omnibus.


Aut qua via te captent illi, eadem ipsos capi?
E^eu me miseram, cur non aut istaec mihi
Aetas and forma est, aut tibi haec sententia?

IF the old man ask for me, tell him I am newly gone
To the haven to enquire of Pamphilus' s coming.
Do you hear what I say Syra? if he ask for me, be sure that
You tell him then; if he shall not ask, do not tell him,
That I may make use of this excuse, yet never made another time,
But do not I see Philotis? whence does she come?
Philotis, God save you heartily.

O Parmeno, God save you.

In troth God save you Parm^no.

And you Syra in good sooth,
Tell me Philotis, where have you solac^d your self so long a time?

Truly I have not solaced my self, who went
Hence to Corinth with a most unkind soldier;
I poor woman endured him there two whole years together.

Truly Philotis I think you had often a good mind
To see Ath^ns again, and that you reperted
Of the course you had taken.

It cannot be said,
How desirous I was to come hither again, and get away from the soldier,
And see you here, that according to our old accustomed manner
I might freely feast it amongst you.
For there I might not speak, but by appointment,
What words might please him.

I do not think
The soldier did hand somelie bound your discourse.

But what business is this? what stories did Bacchis
Tell me erewhile within here? a thing which I never thought
Would come to pass, that he could frame his mind
To have a wife, whilst she is alive.

What to have one?

Oh you, has he (...) o^e?

He has one, but I fear this marriage will not hold.

God gra^^ it may not, if it be for Ba^chis good.
But how should I believe that it is so? tell me Parmeno.

There is no need it should be spoken; forbear
To ask me this.

Verily for that reason (I could forbear) that it may not come abroad;
I swear I do not ask you therefore that
I may disclose this thing, but that I may silentlie rejoice with my self.

You shall never speak so handsomelie, as that I will trust
My back with you.

Ah Parmeno, do not say so,
As though you had not rather tell me this,
Then I who ask, would know.

She speaks the truth.
And this is a very great fault that I have; if you will promise me on your
word
That you will say nothing of it, I will tell you.

You come to your old by as:
I plight you my faith: speak.

Hearken.

I am wholly intent upon you.

As Pa^ philus
Loved this Ba^^his very dearly, so then especially
When his father began to entreat him to take a wife,
And to tell him these things, which are common to all fathers,
That he was an old man, and that he was only son,
And that he desired he might be his succor in his old age.

Was more earnestly urgent upon him, he put him into a quandarie,
Whether he should rather yield to shame or love.
At the last by importuning and wearying the old man brought it about:
He handfasted this next neighbors daughter to him.
Pamphilus all the while,
Till he was just upon the marriage: after he saw
It was provided, and that there was no delay made, but he must marry:
He then at length took it so heavilie, that I believe
Bacchis her self, if she had been there, would then have pitied him.

That he might talk with me, (he would say) O Parmeno,
I am undone, what have I done? into what mischief have I plunged my self?
I shall never be able to endure this, Parmeno, I am undone poor man.

But God confound thee Laches with that thy wearying him.


He had nothing to do with the maid that first night:
The night following, he did as little to her.

What say you? could a young man lie in a bed with a maid,
Being soundly tipled, and so as to refrain himself from her?


I believe it seems so to you; for no body comes to you,
Except he have a desire to you; he had married her against his will.

What fell out afterward?

Truly within a very few days
After Pamphilus drew me alone out of the doors,

And that he, before he had married her and brought her home,
Did hope he should be able to abide the marriage.
But, Parmeno (says he) it is neither honest for me, nor good for the maid,
That she, whom I concluded, I should not be able to keep any longer

But that I should deliver her again undesteined, as I received her from her
friends

You tell me of the honest and chaste nature of Pamphilus.

I think it very unfitting for me to publish this;
And that she should be restored to her father, against whom you can a Redge no
fault

When she knows this, that she cannot abide with me.

What did he in the mean time? did he go to Bacch is?

Every day.
But, as it fell out, after she saw him estranged from her,
She presently became a great deal more froward, and more malapert.



And that matter did most of all
Separate him from her, after he sufficiently understood himself,
And her, and this woman which was at home,
Considering both their behaviors by way of comparison:
This woman, as becomes one that is of u good nature,

Of her husband, and concealed his taunting words.
Hereupon his affection being partly engaged by the pity
Of his wife, and partly overcome by the injuries of this Bacchis,
By little and little stole away from Bacchis, and set his love

In the mean time an old man a kinsman of these
Died in Imbrus, the inheritance fell to these by law:
His father packt Pamphilus being in love thither against his will;
He left his wife here with his mother; for the old man


What instabilitie has the marriage hitherto?

You shall now hear; at first indeed for a few days
The women agreed very well amongst themselves:
In the mean time she began wonderfully to distaste Sostrata,

Any complaining.

What then?

If at any time she came to her,
To talk with her, she presently got out of her sight,
She would not see her: at last when she could not abide it,
She made as though she was sent for by her mother to a sacrifice; she went
away

They then alleged I know not, what excuse; she bids again.
No body sent her back. After she had sent for her somewhat often,
They pretend that the woman was sick. Our mistress presently
Goes to her to visit her: no body gave her admission. When the old man
understood this

And talked with Philumena's father out of hand.
I do not yet know what they did amongst themselves;
But indeed I am sollicitous, what this may come to.
You know all the matter; I will go on this journie, whither I began.


That I would come and speak with him.

God speed you
In what you do.

Fare you well.

And fare you well heartily, Philotis.

SEnex si quaeret me, modo isse dicito
Ad portum percontatum adventum Pamphili.
Audin quid dicam Syra? si quaeret me, uti
Tum dicas; si non quaeret, nullus dixeris,

Sed videon' ego Philotin? unde haec advenit?
Philot is, salve multum.

O salve Parmeno.

Salve mecaster Parmeno.

Et tu aedipol Syra.
Dic mihi Philoti, ubi te oblectasti tam diu?


Corinthum hinc sum profecta inhumanissimo;
Biennium ibi perpetuum misera illum tuli.

Aedipol te desiderium Athenarum arbitror
Philotium cepisse saepe, and te tuum


Non dici potest,
Quam cupida eram huc redeundi, abeundi a milite,
Vosque hic videndi, antiqua ut con^uetudine
Agitarem inter vos libere convivium;
Nam illic haud licebat, nisi praefinito loqui


Haud opinor commode
Finem orationi statuisse militem.

Sed quid hoc negotii est? modo quae narrav^^ mihi
Hic intus Bacchis? quod ego nunquam credidi
Fore, ut ille hac viva posset animum inducere


Habere autem?

Eho tu, an non habet?

Habet, sed firmae hae vereor ut sint nuptiae.

Ita Dii Deaeque faxint, si in rem est Bacchidis.
Sed qui istuc credam ita esse? dic mihi, Parmeno.

Non opus est prolato; hoc percontatier


Nempe ea causa, ut ne id fiat palam;
Ita me Dii been ament, haud propterea te rogo, ut
Hoc proferam, sed tacita ut mecum gaudeam.

Nunquam tam dices commode, ut tergum meum
Tuam in fidem committam.

Ah, noli, Parmeno,

Quam ego quae percontor scire.

Vera haec praedicat,
Etillud mihi vitium est maximum. Simihi fidem
Das te tacituram, dicam.

Ad ingenium redis:
Fidem do: loquere.

Ausculta.

Istic sum.

Hanc Bacchidem
Pamphilus,
Cum pater uxorem ut ducat orare occipit,
Et haec, communia omnium quae sunt patrum,
Se senem esse dicece, illum autem esse unicum,
Praesi^um velle se senectuti suae.

Pater instat, secit animi ut incertus foret,
Pudorin' anne amori obsequeretur magis.
Tundendo atque odio denique effecit senex:
Despondit ei gnatam hujus vicini proxumi.
Pamphilo neutiquam grave,
Donec jam in ipsis nuptiis: postquam videt
Paratas, nec moram ullam, quin ducat, dari:
Ibi demum ita aeg^e tulit, ut ipsam Bacchidem,
Si adesset, credo ibi ejus commiseresceret.

Ut conloqui mecum una posset; Parmeno,
Perii. Quid ego egi? in quod ego me conjeci malum?
Non potero far hoc, Parmeno; perii miser.

At te Dii Deaeque perduint cum istoc odio, Laches.


Nocte illa prima virginem non attigit:
Quae consequu^a est nox, eam nihilo magis.

Quid aid? cum virgin una adolescens cubuerit
Plus potus, se illa abstinere ut potuerit?


Credo ita videri tibi: nam nemo ad te venit,
Nisi cupiens tui: ille invitus illam duxerat.

Quid deinde fit?

Diebus sane pauculis
Post Pamphilus me solum subduxit for as,

Seque antequam eam uxorem duxisset domum,
Sperasse eas tolerare posse nuptias:
Sed quam decreverim me non posse diutius
Habere, eam ludibrio habere, Parmeno,

Neque honestum mihi, neque utile ipsi virgini est.

Pium and pudicum ingenium narras Pamphili.

Hoc ego profe^re incommodum mihi esse arbitror,
Reddi patri autem, cui tu nihil dicas vitii,
Superbum est: sed illam sp^ro, ubi hoc cognoverit,
Non posse se mecum esse, abituram denique.

Quid interea? ibatne ad Bacchidem?

Quotidie:
Sed, ut fit, postquam hunc alienum ab se videt,
Maligna multo and magis procax facta illico est.



Atque ea res multo maxume
Disjunxit illum ab illa, postquam and ipse sese
Et illam, and hanc quae domi erat cognovit satis,
Ad exemplum ambarum mores earum aestimans;
Haec, ita uti liberali esse ingenio decet,

Viri omnes far, and tegere contumelias.
Hic animus, partim uro: is mesericordia
D^v^^ctus, partim victus hujus injutia,
Paulatim elapsus est Bacchide, atque huic transtulit

Interea in Imbro moritur cognatus senex
Horum, ad hos redibat lege haereditas:
Eo amantem in^itum Pamphilum extrudit pater;
Reliquit cum matre hic uxorem; nam senex


Quid adhuc habent infirmitatis nuptiae?

Nunc audies; primum dies complusculos
Been conveniebat sane inter ^as:
Interim mitis modis odisse cepit Sostratam,

Nunquam.

Quid igitur?

Si quando ad eam accesserat
Confabulatum, fugere e conspectu illico,
Videre nolle: denique ubi non quivit pati,
Simulat se a matre accersi ad rem divinam: abiit.

Dixere causam tunc nescio quam; iterum jubet.
Nemo remisit, postquam accersivit saepius,
Aegram esse simulant mulierem. Nostra illico
It visere ad eam: admisit nemo. Hoc ubi senex rescivit,

Patrem continuo conveni^ Philumenae.
Quid egerint inter se nondum etiam scio,
Nisi sane ^urae est, quorsum eventurum hoc siet.
Habes omnem re^, pergam, quo cep^, hoc iter.


Me esse ill^ conventuram.

Dii vortant been
Quod agas.

Vale.

Et tu been vale, Philo^i.

O Strange, what a sort of women is this? what conspiracy is this?
That all women should alike affect the same things, and be unwilling to all
things
Nor shall you find any that has swerved any whit from others disposition;
And therefore thus with one consent all mothers in law have hated their
daughters in law

Me thinks they are all instructed to naughtiness in the same school:
And I am sure, if any be, this woman is the mistress of that school.

O wretched woman that I am, who do not know now, wherefore I am accused.

Ha,
Do not you know?

No, I swear my Laches;


God forbid those evils.

And you shall know after a while that I am wrongfully accused by you.

I know
That you are wrongfully accused. Can any thing be spoken as you deserve for
those pranks,
Who do disgrace me and your self, and our family, and breed your son sorrow?
And besides you make our marriage-kindred of friends to become our enemies;

You alone are started up, to put these things out of order by your impudence.

What I?

You, I say woman, who judge me to be a stone altogether, and not a man.
Do you think, because I use to be often in the country, that I know not,
How every one of you leads his life here?

Therefore because as you shall be to me at home, so I shall be by report
abroad
Truly I heard long ago that Philumena hated you,
And it is no marvail; and if she had not done it, it had been a greater
marvail
But I did not believe withal, that she hated his whole house;

But see how undeservedly this grief befalls me through you, Sostrata;
I went hence to dwell in the country, giving way to you, and striving to get
something
That my means might be able to bear your cost and idleness,
Not sparing my pains, above what was meet for me, and my age.


Truly it came not to pass by my means, nor through my default.

Yes most of all.
You was here alone. Sostrata, all the fault lies upon you.
You should have looked to what was here, seeing I acquitted you of all other
ears
Are you not ashamed being an old-woman to fall out with a girl?


Truly I do not say so, my Laches.

I am glad, I swear, for my son's sake. For as for you, I know very well,
No damage can be done you by your doing amiss.

How do you know, my husband, whether she made as though she hated me for that
cause,
That she might be more with her mother?

What say you? is it not^ token sufficient,


No, for they then said she was very faint-sick, and so I was not admitted to
her

I think that your manners are rather a sickness to her then a^ other thing.
And good cause why; for there is none of you, but would have her son
Marry a wife; and what offer pleases you, is granted.


PRob D^u^ atque hominum fidem, quod hoc genus est? quae hae^ conju^at^^?
Ut omnes mulieres eadem aeque studeant, noli^^ que omnia?
Neque de^linatam quicquam ab alia^um ingenio ullam reperies.
Itaque adeo uno animo omnes socrus oderunt nurus.

In eodem omnes mihi viden^u^ ludo doctae ad malitiam:
Et ei ludo, si ull^s est, magistram ha^c esse satis certo scio.

Me miseram, quae nunc, quamobrem accuser, nes^io.

Hem,
Tu nes^is?

Non ita me Dii ament, mi Laches;


Dii mala prohibeant.

Meque abs te immerito esse accusatam postmodum r^scisces.

S io,
Te immerito; an quicquam pro istis factis dignum te dici potest
Quae me, and te, and familiam ded^coras, filio luctum paras?
Tum autem ex amicis inimici ut sint nobis affines facis;

Tu sola exorere, quae perturbas haec tua impudentia.

Egone?

Tu, inquam, mulier, quae me omnino lapidem, non hominem putas.
An quia ruri crebro esse soleo, nescire arbitramini,
Quo quisque pacto hic vitam vestrorum exigat?

Ideo quia ut vos mihi domi eritis, proinde ego pro fama foris.
Jampridem equidem audivi cepisse odium tui Phil^men^m:
Minimeque adeo mi^um; and ni id fecisset, magis mi^um foret.
Sed non credidi adeo, ut etiam hanc totam odisset domum;

At vide quam immerito aeg^itudo haec oritur mihi abs te, Softrata;
Rus habitatum abii, concedens vobis, and rei serviens,
Sumptus vestros otiumque ut nostra res posset pati,
Meo labori haud parcens, praeter aequum atque a tatem meam.


Non mea opera, neque pol culpa evenit.

Immo maxim.
Sola hic fuisti, in te omnis haeret culpa, Sostr^^^.
Quae hic erant, curares, cum ego vos solvi c^ caeteris.
Cum puella anum suscepisse inimicitias non pudet?


Haud equidem dico, mi Laches.

Gaud^o, ita me Dii ament, gnati causa. Number de te quidem
Satis scio, peccando detrimenti nihil fieri potest.

Qui scis, an ^a causa, mi vir, me odisse se a^. verit,
(...) cum matre una plus esset?

Quid ais? non signi sat est,


Etenim lassam ^am oppido tum ai^bant: eo ad ^am non admissa sum.

Tuos esse illi mo^es mo^bum magis quam aliam rem arbitror:
Et merito adeo; nam vestrarum nulla est, quin g^atum velit^
Ducere uxorem; and quae vobis placita est conditio, datur.


ALthough I know, Philum^na, I have authority to compel you,
To do what I command you; yet I being ^vercome with a fatherly affection
Will willingly yield to you, neither* will I cross your will.

And look I see Phidippus in very good time; n^w I shall know of him what the
matter is
Phidippus, though I know that I am very yielding to all mine,
Yet not so far as my gentle nature should corrupt their minds;
Which same thing if you would be, it would do more for your good and ours also.
Now I see you have your head under their girdles.

Soft for so^th.

I came to you yesterday concerning your daughter, you sent me away as
uncertain as I came

For you to conceal your anger; if we have done any thing amiss, out with it:
For we will make you amends, either by confuting, or excusing it,
You your self being the judge: but if that be the cause of keeping her with
you
Because she is sick, I suppose you do me wrong, Phidippus,

Bu^ swear, I do not yield this unto you, though you be her father,
That you should desire her safety more then I; and that the rather for (...)
son's sake
Whom (...) conceive does esteem her no less then himself.
Ne^r is it so unknown to me, how heavily I think he may take it,


Laches, I acknowledge both your diligence and kindness toward my daughter,
And persuade my self, that all things which you say, is as you say:
And I desire you to believe me this, I labor that she may return to you,
If I may effect it by any means.

What thing hinders you from doing it?


No. For after I minded
More, and began to constrain her by force to return, she swore solemnly
That she could not abide it out at your house, whilst Pamphilus was away.
Another man perhaps has another fault. I am naturally of a soft disposition.
I cannot thwart any of mine.

Ho Sostrata!

Woe is me poor woman!



Truly, as now it seems. But would you have any thing?
For there is cause why I must now step to the market.

(...) will go with you.

ETsi s^io, Philumena, meum jus esse ut te cogam,
Quae ego imperem facere: ego tamen patrio animo victus faciam
Ut tibi concedam, neque tuae libidini adversabor.

Atque eccum Phidippum optime video; jam scibo ex ho^ quid si^t.
(...) Phidippe, etsiego meis me omnibus scio esse adprime obsequente^,
Sed non adeo ut mea facilitas corrumpat illorum animos:
Quod si tu idem faceres, magis in rem and vestram and nostram id esset.
Nunc video in illarum potestate esse te.

Eja vero.

Adii te h^ri de filia; ut veni itidem incertum amisisti.
Haud ita decet, si perpetuam hanc vis esse affinit^tem,
Celare te iras: si quid est peccatum a nobis, profer:
Aut ^a refellendo aut purgando vobis corrigemus,
Tejudice ipso: sin ^a est causa retinendi apud vos,
Quia aegra est, te mihi injuriam facere arbitror, Phidippe,

At ita me Dii ament, haud tibi hoc concedo, etsi illi pater es,
Ut tu illam salvam magis velis, quam ego; id adeo gnati causa,
Que^ ego intellexi illam haud minus quam seipsum, magni facere.
Neque adeo clam me est, quam esse eum graviter laturu credam,


Laches, and diligentiam vestram and benignitatem erga meam filiam
Novi, and quae dicis omnia, esse ut dicis, animum induco:
Et te hoc mihi cupio credere; illam ad vos redire studeo,
Si facere possim ullo modo.

Quae res te id facere prohibet?


Minime: nam postquam attendi
Magis, and vi cepi cogere ut rediret, sancte adjurat,
Non posse apud vos, Pamphilo, se, absente perdurare.
Aliud sortasse alii vitii est. Ego sum animo leni natus:
Non possum adversari meis.

Hem Sostrata?

Heu me miseram!



Nunc, quidem, ut videtur. Sed nunquid vis?
Nam est quod me transire ad sorum jam oportet.

Eo tecum una.

IN good sooth we women are all alike hated by our ^usbands,
Because of a few: which makes us all seem wor^^ie of mischief.
For I swear, as for this that my husband new accuses me, I am blameless,
But it is not an easy thing to be cleared: they have so persuaded themselves,
that al

Otherwise, then if she had been born of my own body; neither do I know, how
this should befall me
But indeed I earnestly expect my son, that he should return home.

AE Dipol nos sumus mulieres aeque omnes invisae viris,
Propter paucas: quae omnes faciunt dignae ut videamur malo.
Nam, ita me Dii ament, quod me accusat nunc vir, sum extra noxiam,
Sed non facile est expurgare: ita animum induxerunt; socrus

Habui illam, ac si ex me esset nata: nec qui hoc mihi eveniat, s^io.
Nisi pol filium multis modis jam expecto ut redeat domum.

I Believe never more bitter things befell any man for love
Then me* O unfortunate man I! have I forborne to make an end of this life?
Was I for this cause so desirous to return home?
For whom how much better had it been to have lived aniewhere in the world,

For to all of us, unto whom any trouble is offered from any place,
All that time of the interim, before it be known, is as gain.

But be it so: I can sooner find a means how you may rid your self of these
troubles
If you had not returned, these fallings out had been made a great deal more.
Pamphilus, that now both of them will reverence your coming:
You shall know the matter; you shall end their anger; you shall make them
friends again
These things are light, which your have persuaded your self to be very heavy.

Why do you comfort me? is any man in the world so wretched as I am?
Before I married her, I had my mind engaged in love elsewhere.

Nevertheless I dur^^ never refuse her, whom my father thrusts upon me.
I have scarcely withdrawn my self thence, and set my mind free which was
entangled with her
And I had scarcely got hither; lo, a new matter is a-broach, which may also
withdrawn me from this woman
Besides I think my mother or my wife is in fault about tha^ thing:

For duty, Parmeno, commands me to bear with my mother's wrongs;
Besides; I am beholden to my wife, she did heretofore out of her own good
nature
Bear so many wr^ngs of mine, which she never disclosed in any place.
But it must needs be, Parmeno, that some great matter, I know not what, has
happened


Truly it is no small matter* but if you will reason rightly,
The greatest fallings out that are sometimes, do not cause
The greatest wrongs; for it often falls out, when in what things one man is
not angry at all
An hasty man becomes an utter enemy for the same cause.

Wherefore? because they carry a weak spirit, which governs them.
In like manner those women are almost, as children are, of an unstable mind.
Perhaps some one word may have raised this anger betwixt them.

Go thy way in, Parmeno: and tell them I am come.

Ha, what is this ado?

Hold youo peace.


Come nearer: how now, have you perceived it?

Do not prate.
O Jupiter! (...) hear an outcry*

You speak your self, and do you forbid me?

Peace, I pray you, my daughter.

It seems to be Philum^*na's mother's tongue.
I am undone.

Why so?

Because I am lost.

Wherefore?

Truly Parmeno,


They said your wife
Philum^ was troubled at I know not what; except that be it, I cannot tell.

I am undone, why did you not tell me that?

Alas, because I could not tell you all at once.

What disease is it?

I know not.

What has no body brought a physician?

I know not.

Do I linger to go in hence, that I may know the certainty whatever it is as
soon as may be
Philumena, how shall I now find you affected?
For if there be any danger in you, there is no doubt but I shall die with you

There is no need for me now to follow him in;
For I perceive they cannot endure to look upon us.
Yesterday no body would suffer Sostrata to come in.

Which truly I should beloth, especially for my master's sake,
They will presently say* strata's servant is come in,
And will imagine that he has brought some ill with him,
Whereby the sickness may be increased, which I wish may light on their own
head and age


NEmini plura ego acerba credo esse ex amore homini unquam oblata,
Quam mihi. Heu me infelicem! hanccine vitam parsi perdere?
Haccine causa ego eram tantopere cupidus redeundi domum?
Cui quanto fuerat praestabilius, ubivis gentium agere aetatem,

Nam nos omnes, quibus est alicunde aliquis objectus labos,
Omne quod est interea t^mpus, priusquam id rescitu^ est, lucro est.

At sit; citius qui te expedias his aerumnis reperiam;
Si non rediisses, hae irae factae essent multo ampliores;
Pamphile, scio reveri^uras;
Rem cognosces; iram expedies; rursum in gratiam restitues.
Levia sunt, quae tu pergravia esse in animum induxisti tuum.

Quid consolare me* an quisquam aeque miser est gentium?
Priusquam hanc uxorem duxi, habeba^ animu^ alibi amori deditu^:

Tamen nunqua^ ausus sum recusare eam, qua^ mihi obtrudit pater*
Vix me illinc abstraxi, atque impeditum in ea expedivi animum meum,
Vixque huc contuleram: hem, nova res orta est, porro ab hac quae me abstrahat*
Tum matrem ex ea re aut uxorem in culpa esse arbitror;

Nam matris far injurias, Parmeno, pi^tas jub^^;
Tum uxori ob noxius sum: ita olim suo me ingenio pertulit
Tot meas injurias, quae nunquam in ullo patefecit loco.
Sed magnum, nescio quid, necesse est evenisse, Parmeno,


Haud quidem hercle, parvum est; si vis vero veram rationem exsequi,
Non maxumas, quae maxumae interdum sunt irae, injurias
Faciunt: nam saepe est, quibus in rebus alius ne iratus quidem est,
Cum de ea them causa est iracundus factus inimicissimus.

Quapropter? quia enim, quieos gub^rnat animus, infirmu^ gerunt.
Itidem illae mulieres sunt ferme, ut pu^ri, levi sententia,
Fortasse unum aliquod ve^b^m inter eas i^am hanc consciverit.

Abi, Parmeno, intro; ac me venisse nuncia.

Hem, quid hoc?

Tace.


Accede propius: hem, sensisti^'?

Noli fabularier.
Proh Jupiter! clamorem au^io.

Tute loqueris, me v^tas?

Tace, obsecro, mea gnata.

Matris vox visa est Philumenae.
Nullus sum.

Qui dum?

Q^a perii.

Quamobrem?

Nescio quod magnum malum
Parmeno, me celant.

Uxorem Philumemenam
Pavitare, nescio quid, dixerunt; id si forte est, nes^io.

Interii, cur id mihi non dixisti?

Ah, quia non poteram una omnia.

Quid morbi est?

Nescio.

Quid? nemon' medicum adduxit?

Nescio.

Cesso, hinc ire intro, ut hoc quam primum quicquid est certum sciam?
Philumena mea, te nunc offendam affectam?
Nam si periculum ullum in te inest, periisse me una haud dubium est.

Non usus facto est mihi nunc hunc intro sequi:
Nam invisos nos esse illis sentio.
Heri nemo voluit Sostratam intro admittere.

Quod sane nolim, maxume heri causa mei,
Servum illico introisse dicent Sostratae;
Aliquid tul^^e comminiscentur mali,
Capiti atque aetati illorum morbus qui auctus siet.


I Poor woman heard a bustle here a while ago, I know not about what;
I greatly fear, lest Philumena's sickness should be increased;
For which I beseech thee Aesculapius, and thee Salus, that no such thing may
be
Now I will go to her to visit her.

Ho Sostrata.

What now?



O Parmeno, was you here? I am undone; what shall I do poor woman?
Shall not I go see Pamphilus wife, when she is sick hard by?

Do not go to see her, neither send any one at all to visit her.
For he that loves her, that hates him, I think he plays a double fool:
He wastes his own labor, and does but trouble he^*
And besides your son, as soon as he came, went in to see how she does.

What say you? is Pamphilus come?

He is come.

I thank God.
Lo my spirit is revived with that word, and care is gone from my heart.

Now for that reason most of all I would not have you go in hither:
Philumenas pains shall any whit stake,
I know she will presently tell him all the matter alone by themselves,
Which happened betwixt you; and how your falling out first began;
And lo I see him come forth, how sad he is?

O my son.

O my mother, God save you.

I am glad you come safe, is Philumena


She is somewhat better then she was.

God grant it be so.
Why do you weep then? or why are you so sad?

All is well enough mother.

What stir, was that? tell me, did the pain take her on a sudden?

So it was:

What is her disease?

An ague.

A quotidian?

So they say.
Go in I pray you, mother, I will follow you.

Be it so.

Parmeno do you run to meet the boys, and help them with their burdens.

What? do not they know the way home themselves, which way they may come back
again

Do you loiter?

NEscio quid jamdudum audio hic tumultuari misera:
Male metuo, ne Philnmenae magis morbus aggravescat;
Quod te Aesculapi and te Salus, ne quid sit hujus, o^^.
Nunc ad eam visam.

Heus Sostrata.

Hem.



Ehem Parmeno, tun' hic eras? perii; quid faciam misera?
Non visam uxorem Pamphili, cum in proximo hic sit aegra?

Non visas, nec mittas quidem visendi causa quenquam.
Nam qui amat, cui odio ipsus est, bis facere stulte duco:
Laborem inanem ipsus capit, and illi molestiam affert.
Tum autem filius tuus introiit videre, ut venit, quid agat.

Quid ais? an venit Pamphilus?

Venit.

Diis gratias habeo.
Ehem istoc verbo animus mihi rediit, and cura ex cord recessit.

Jam ea te causa maxume nunc huc introire nolo;
Philumenae dolores,
Omnem rem narrabit scio continuo sola soli,
Quae inter vos intervenit; unde ortum est initium itae.
Atque eccu^ video ipsum egredi; quam tristis est?

O mi gnate.

Mea matter, salve.

Gaudeo venisse salvum: salva n'
Philumena est?

Meliuscula est.

Utinam istuc Dii faxint.
Quid tu igitur lacrumas? aut quid es tam tristis?

Recte, matter.

Quid fuit tumulti? dic mihi, an dolor repent invasit?

Ita sactum est.

Quid morbi est?

Febris.

Quotidiana n'?

Ita aiunt.
I sodes intro, consequar te, mea matter.

Fiat.

Parmeno, obviam, atque his onera adjuta.

Quid? non sciunt ipsi viam domum qua redeant?

Cessas?

I Cannot find any handsome entrance of my business,
Whence I may begin to tell, what things befell me at unawares;
Partly what I beheld with these eyes, and partly what I heard.
Wherefore I got my self, being astonished, the sooner out of doors.

I should see her sick of another disease, then I perceive my wife to be: woe is
me
After the maids saw I was come, they presently altogether
Merrily cried out, He is come; that was because they had espied ^e (...) a
sudden:
But presently I saw all their countenances to be changed,
Because I had luck to come so unseasonably to them.
One of them by chance in the mean time ran hastily before, and told them I
wus come.
I being desirous to see her, follow on straight; after I came in, I quickly
knew her disease
Poor man. For neither did time give any space that it might be concealed,
Nor was she able to complain in another voice, then the matter advertised her.
After I saw it, O unworthy fact, said I, and presently conveyed
My self thence weeping, being heart-struck with a thing so incredible and
heinous.
Her mother follows me; and just as I was going out over the threshold, she
fell down at my knees
Weeping poor woman; it pitied me to see her. Truly it is so as I think,
So we are high or humble-minded as things offer themselves to all of us.
She continued to have this speech with me from the beginning:
O my Pamphilus, you see the reason wherefore she went from you,
For the maid was defloured long since by I know not what lewd fellow,
Now she is fled hither, that she might conceal her birth from you and others.
But when I remember her entreaties, I cannot but weep poor man.
Whatsoever f^e it is, says she, which brought you to us this day,
We both beseech you by it, if it be right and lawful,
That her misfortunes may be by your means covered, and concealed toward all
folks;
If ever you perceived her, Pamphilus, to bear a loving affection toward you,
She now entreats you, that you would grant her this favor without much ado.
But for bringing her back again, do that which may be for your own good.
You only are privy that she is in travail, and was not with child by you;
For they say she lay with you full two months after,
And now this is the seventh month since she came to you,
Which that you know the thing it self shows; now if it can be, Pamphilus,
I earnestly desire and labor, that the childbirth may happen unknown to her
father,
And every body also; but if it cannot be, but they must perceive it,
I will say that she miscarried; I know no body will suspect otherwise,
But, which is very likely to be true, they will judge straight that you are
the father.
It shall be put out forthwith; here is no less likely to be fall you,
And shall cover the wrong unworthilie done to her poor woman.
I promised her, and I am resolved to keep my promise in that which I said.
For as for bringing her back, I think that is not any whit convenient,
Neither will I do it, though her love and familiarity greatly engage me.
I can but weep, when I remember, what a life I shall have hereafter,
And lonelie condition. O fortune, how thou art never ^cnsta^^lie good!
But now my former love has made me used to this thing,
Which I purposelie let pass; I will now endeavor to do the like in this
matter.
Parmeno is here with the boys; it is not requisite he should be by
In this business: for heretofore I told him only,
That I refrained from her at the first when she was given me.
I am afraid, if he shall hear her skriek often,
Lest he should perceive she is in labor; I must needs send him hence
On some errant somewhither, till Philumena be brought in bed.

NEqueo mearum rerum initium ullum invenire idoneum,
Unde exordiar narrare, quae nec opinanti accidunt.
Partim quae perspexi his oculis partim quae accepi auribus.
Qua me propter exanimatum citius eduxi soras.

Morbo me visurum ad fectam, ac sensi uxorem esse; hei mihi,
Postquam me aspexere ancillae advenisse, illico omnes simul
Laetae exclamant, Venit: id quod me repent adspexerant,
Sed continuo vultum earum sensi immutari omnium,

Una illarum forte interea propere praecucurrit nuntians me venisse;
Ego ejus videndi cupidus, recta consequor: posteaquam introii, extemplo ejus
morbu
Cognovi miser. Nam neque ut celari posset tempus spatium ullum dabat:
Neque voce alia, ac res mon^bat, ipsa poterat conqueti.

Me inde lacrumans, incredibili re atque atroci percitus.
Matter consequitur: jam ut limen exirem, ad genua accidit
Lacrumans misera; miseritum est. Profecto sic est ut puto,
Omnibus nobis, ut res dant sese, ita magni atque humiles sumus.

O mi Pamphile, abs te quam ob rem abierit, causam vides:
Nam vitium est oblatum virgini olim ab nescio quo improbo;
Nunc huc confugit, te atque alios partum ut celaret suum.
Sed cum orata ejus reminiscor, nequeo quin lacrumem miser.

Per eam te obsecramus ambae, si jus, si fas est, uti
Adversa ejus per te tecta tacitaque apud omnes siet;
Si unquam erga te animo esse amico sensisti eam, Pamphile,
Sine labor hanc gratiam te uti sibi des, illa ^un^ rogat.
Caeterum de reducenda, id facias quod in rem sit tuam.
Partutire eam neque gravidam esse ex te solus conscius;
Nam aiunt tecum post duobus concubuisse eam mensibus:
Tum postquam ad te venit, mensis agitur hic jam septimus,
Quod te scire ipsa indicat res; nunc si potis est, Pamphile,

Atque adeo omnes; sed si fieri id non potest, quin sentiant,
Dicam abortam esse: scio nemini aliter suspectum sore,
Quin, quod verisimile est, ex te recte eum natum putent.
Continuo exponetur; hic' tibi nihil est quicquam incommodi,

Pollicitus sum, and servare in eo certum est, quod dixi, fidem.
Nam de reducenda, id vero neutiquam honestum esse arbitror.
Nec faciam, etsi amor me graviter, consuetudo que ejus tenet.
Lachrymo, quae post hac futura est vita, cum in mentem venit,

Sed jam prior amor me ad hanc rem exercitatum reddidit,
Quem ego consilio missum feci: idem nunc huic operam dabo.
Adest Parmeno cum pueris: hunc minime est opus
In hac re adesse: nam olim soli credidi,

Vereor si clamorem ejus hic crebro audiat,
Ne parturire intelligat. Aliquo mihi est
Hinc abl^gandus, dum parit Philumena.

DO you say you had an ill journey of this?

Truly Parmeno it cannot be expressed in words,
So much, as it is indeed incommodious to sail.

Is it so?

O happy man, you know not what evil*

For that I may omit other miseries, consider but this one,
I was thirty days or more then that, in the ship,
When in the mean time I poor man ever looked for death:
We had such a tempest continual^ie against us.



It is not unknown to me; to conclude, I would run away
Rather then return, if I knew I was to return thither.

Heretofore indeed slight occasions moved you
To do, Sosia, that which you now threaten to do.
But I see Pamphilus himself stand before the door;

Master, what do you stand here?

Truly I am looking for you.

What is the matter?

One must needs step in to the Castle.

Who?

You.

Into the Castle, why thither?

Go meet with Callidemides my host,
Who was brought hither together with me.


Home safe, he would quite burst me with walking-up and down.

Why do you loyter?

What would you have me say? should I only meet him?

Yes, tell him that whereas I appointed to meet with him to day.
I cannot do it; and that he may not in vain tarry for me there, make haste.



But I will teach you how to know him.
He is a big-man, ruddie, curled, gross, gray-eyed,
A ghastly face.

A destruction light upon him.
What if he will not come? shall I tarry till the evening?

Don' tarry: run.

I cannot; I am so weary.


How I should conceal this, which Myrrhina entreated me,
The child birth of her daughter: for I pity the woman,
I will do what I can, yet so as to show my duty,
For I ought rather to give way to my mother, then the love of her.

They come on hitherwards; I know not what I should say to these.

AIn'tu tibi incommodum hoc evenisse iter?

Non hercle verbis, Parmeno, dici potest
Tantum, quam re ipsa navigare incommodum est.

Itane est?

O fortunate, nescis quid mali

Nam alias ut mittam miserias, unam hanc vide;
Dies triginta aut plus eo, in navi fui,
Cum interea semper mortem expectabam miser;
Ita usque advorsa tempestate usi sumus.



Haud clam me est; denique hercle au* fungerim
Potius, quam redeam, si eo mihi redeundum sciam.

Olim quidem te causae impellebant leves,
Quod nunc minitare facere, ut faceres, Sosia.
Sed Pamphilum ipsum video stare ante ostium;

Here, etiam tu hic stas?

Equidem te exspecto.

Quid est?

In arcem transcurso opus est.

Cui homini?

Tibi*

In arcem, quid co?

Callidemidem hospitem
Qui mecum una advectus est, conveni.


Rediisset unquam, ut me ambulando rumperet.

Quid cessas?

Quid vis dicam? an conveniam modo?

Imo quod constitui me hodie conventurum cum,
Non posse: and ne me frustra illic exspectet: vola.



At faciam ut noveris,
Magnus, rubicundus, crispus, crassus, caesius,
Cadaverosa facies.

Dii illum perduint.
Quid si non veniat? man^amne usque ad vesperem?

Maneto; curre.

Non queo; ita defessus sum.


Quo pacto hoc celem, quod me oravit Myrrhina,
^uae g^atae partum; nam me miseret mulieris.
Quod potero faciam, tamen ut pietatem colam:
Nam me parenti potius quam amori obsequi

Video, horsum pergunt; quid dicam hisce incertus sum.

Did not you say a while ago that she said she looked for her son?

It is so.

They say he is come. Let her come home aga^

I know not what reason I can allege to my father,
Why I should not bring her back again.

Whom did I hear speak here?

I am resolved to go on forward in my way, and to pursue the course I have
intended


God save you, my father.

My son, God save you.

It is well done that you are come, Pamphilus.
And so sound and lusty, which is the main matter.

I believe you.

Are you but now come?

Yes.

Tell me what has Phania my sisters son
Left behind him?

To say truly, he was a man given to his pleasure

But they leave themselves this commendation; He lived merrily, whilst he
lived

Have you brought nothing then hither more then one sentence?

What ever it is, that which he left, has done us good.

Nay rather, it has done us hurt:
For I could wish he were alive and in health.

You may wish that without any danger,


This man commanded Philumena yesterday to be sent for: say you did command.

Do not hit me on the side: I did command.

But he will now send her back.

Yes that he will.

I know all the matter how it is carried, I heard all even now as I came.

But a mischieflight on those envious persons, that are ready to tell you these
things


Work me any reproach; and if I would now make rehearsal of that here,
What a faithful kind, and gentle mind I have born toward her,
I might truly do it, but that I had rather you should know these thing from
her
For by that means you shall most of all give credit to my condition,

And I call God to witness that this falling out did not happen through my
default
But forasmuch as she thinks her self unworthy of my mother,
Whom she should yield to, and whose conditions she should bear with through
her own modesty
And seeing a reconcilement can by no other means be made betwixt them;

Now dutte bids me rather to look after my mothers good.

Pamphilus, I have not been unwilling to hear your discourse,
Seeing I perceive you set light by every thing in respect of your mother:
But Pamphilus, have a care, lest being moved by anger you go stubbornlie on.


Who never did any thing against me, father,
Which I would not have done? and I kn^, she has often done, what I desired:
I both love and commend her, and greatly desire her:
I have tried her to be of a wonderful good nature to me ward,
And I wish to her, that she may spend the rest of her life
With that husband, who may be more fortunate then I,
Forasmuch as necessity parts me from her.

What is in your power, that it may not be.

If you be well in your wits,
Bid her to return.

That is none of my purpose, father:


Whither go you? tarry,
Tarry, I say, whither go you?

What a stubborn trick is this?

Did not I tell you, Phidippus, that he would take this matter impatiently?
Wherefore I entreated you, that you would send your daughter back again.

Truly I did not think that he would be so churlish;

If it be, that he is willing to bring his wife back, he may.
But if he be of another mind, let him pay back her portion hither; let him go.

But lo, you also are peevishlie teastie.

Pamphilus, you are returned to us hither very stubborn*



Because ye have got a little money,
Your minds are grown lofty.

Do you fall out with me too?

Let him consider, and bring me word again to day.
Whether he will, or he will not, that she may be for another man, if she be
not for him


Let them end it at last amongst themselves, as they please:
Seeing neither my son nor this man will be ruled by me:
They care not a pin for what I say. I will carry this chi^ing fit
To my wife: by whose advice all these things are done:


DIxtin' dudum illam dixisse se exspectare filium?

Factum.

Venisse ajunt. Redeat.

Quam causam dicam patri,
Quamobrem non reducam, nescio.

Quem ego hic audivi loqui?

Certum obfirmare est viam me, quam decrevi, persequi.

(...).
Ipsus est, de quo hoc agebam tecum.

Salve, mi pater.

Gnate mi, salve.

Been factum te advenisse, Pamphile.
Et adeo, quod maxumum est, salvum atque validum.

Creditur.

Advenis modo?

Admodum.

Cedo, quid reliquit Phania
Consobrinus noster?

Sane hercle homo voluptati obsequens

Sibi vero hanc laudem relinquunt; vixit, dum vixit, been.

Tum^ igitur nihil attulisti huc plu^ una* sententia?

Quicquid est, id quod reliquit, profuit.

Imo, obfuit:
Nam illum vivum and salvum vellem.

Impune optare istuc licet.


Heri Philumenam ad se accersi hic jussit: dic jussisse te.

Noli sodere; jussi.

Sed came jam remittet.

Scilicet.

Omnem rem scio ut sit gesta, adveniens audivi omnia modo.

At istos invidos Dii perdant, qui haec libenter nunciant tibi.


Fieri a vobis posset; idqu* si nunc memorare velim,
Quam fideli and be^igno animo in illam and clementi fui,
Vere possim; ni^ ex ^a haec magis velim rescis^ere;
Namque eo pacto maxu^ apud te meo erit ingenio fides,

Neque mea culpa hoc dissidium evenisse id testor Deos.
Sed quando sese esse indignam deputat matri meae,
Cui concedat, cujusque mores toleraret sua modestia;
Neque alio pacto componi potest inter eas gratia;


Pamphile, haud invito ad aures sermo mihi accessit tuus,
Cum te post pu* ass omnes res prae parente intelligo.
Verum vide ne impulsus ira prave insistas, Pamphile.


Quae nunquam quicquam erga me commerita est, pater,
Quod nollem? and saepe meritam, quod vellem, scio.
Amoque and laudo, and vehementer* desidero:
Nam fuisse erga me miro ingenio expertus sum,
Illique exopto, ut reliquam vitam exigat
Cum eo viro, me qui sit fortunatior,
Quandoquidem illam a me distrahit necessitas.

Tibi id in manu est, ne fiat.

Si sanus satis sies,
Jabe illam redire.

Non est consilium, pater:


Quo abis? mane,
Mane, inquam; quo vadis?

Quae est haec pertinacia?

Dixin', Phidippe, hanc rem aegre laturum esse eum?
Quamobrem orabam ut filiam remitteres.

Non credidi aedipol adeo inhumanum fore;

Si est, ut velit reducere uxorem, licet:
Sin alio est animo, renumeret dotem huc, eat.

Ecce autem, tu quoque proterve irracundus es.

Percontumax redisti huc* nobis, Pamphile.



Quia paulum vobis accessit pecuniae,
Sublati animi sunt.

Etiam mecum litigas?

Deliberet, renuncietque hodie mihi,
Velitne, an non; ut alii, si huic non sit, siet.


Post^emo inter se transigant ipsi, ut lubet;
Quando nec guatus neque hic mihi quicquam obtemperant:
Quae dico parvi pendunt: porto hoc jurgium
Ad uxorem; cujus haec fiunt consilio omnia:


I Am undone, what shall I do? which way shall I turn my self? what answer
Shall I poor wretch make to my husband? for he seemed to have heard the voice
of the crying child
He got himself away on such a sudden to my daughter and said nothing:
But if he shall perceive she is brought to bed, truly I do not know,

But the door creeks; I believe he comes forth to me. I am undone.

My wife, as soon as she saw I went to my daughter, got her self out of doors;
and lo I see her
What say you, Myrrhina? Ho, I speak to you.

To me, my husband?

Am I your husband? do you verily account me to be a husband or a man?

I should not have been thus made a laughing stock by your doings.

By what?

Do you ask?
Is my daughter delivered? ha do you not speak? of whom?

Is it fit for a father to ask the question?
I am undone; of whom think you but of him to whom she was married, I pray you?

I believe it, neither is it for a father to think otherwise. But I wonder,

Especially seeing she was both safely delivered, and according to her counts:
That you should be so crosse-minded, as to wish the child to be lost,
By whom you might understand the friendship amongst us would hereafter be more
stable
Rather then she should be married with him against your will.


I am a wretched woman.

I wish I knew that was so. But now I remember,
What you said about this matter heretofore, when we took him to be our son in
law
For you said you could not abide that your daughter should be married
With him which loved an harbor, who lodged out of doors.



I knew long before you, Myrrhina, that he had a sweetheart,
But I never judged that to be a fault of youth;
For that is ingrafted in all men; but truly the time will be shortly, when he
will also dislike himself
But as heretofore you have showed your self to be the same, you have not
ceased hithert

Now this thing plainly discovers, how you would have it done.

Do you think I am so ^^^art toward (...), to whom I am a mother,
That I should be of that mind, if this marriage might be for our good?

Are you able to foresee or judge what may be for our benefit?

Going out or coming in to his sweetheart: what then of all this,
If he have done this modestly and seldom? is it not more friendly
For us to dissemble, then to labor to know those things, whereby he should
beat us
For if he can on a sudden withdraw himself from her

Neither a man nor a husband constant enough to my daughter.

Let the young man alone, I pray you,
And those things which you say I have done amiss: go your way, talk you alone
by your selves
Ask him whether he will have his wife or not; if it be that he say he will,
Let him have her again; but if it be that he will not, then have I well
provided for my daughter

Myrrhina perceived there was a fault
In him, I was by, by whose advice it was fitting those things should have been
ordered
Wherefore I am inflamed with anger that you should dare to do these things
without my bidding
I charge you, that you carry not the child any whither out of the house.
But I am the more fool that require her to obey my commands:


I think truly no woman* ^th more miserable then I.
For indeed it is not unknown to me, how he will take this,
If he understand the matter it self, how it is; seeing he takes this so
impatiently, which is a lighter thing
Neither do I know which way his mind may be changed.

If he shall constrain me to bring up the child, whose father we know not, who
he is
For when my daughter was ravished, his feature could not be known in the dark:
Neither was then ani^ thing plucked from him, whereby she might afterward know
who he was
He himself when he went away snatched away a ring by force from the maid,
which she had on her finger
Pamphilus cannot conceal what we entreated him
Any longer, when he shall know another man's child to be brought up instead
of his

PErii, quid agam? quo me vortam? quid viro meo respondebo
Misera? nam audisse vocem pueri visus est vagientis;
Ita corripuit de repent tacitus sese ad filiam:
Quod si resciverit peperisse eam, id qua causa

Sed ostium concrep^credo ipsum exire ad me; nulla sum*

Uxor, ubi me ad filiam ire sensit, se duxit for as; atque eccam video.
Quid ais, Myrrhina? Heus tibi dico.

Mihine, mi vir?

Vir ego tuus sum? tune viru^ me aut homine^ deputas adeo esse?

Non sic ludibrio tuis factis habitus essem.

Quibus?

Rogitas?
Peperit filia? hem taces? ex quo?

Istuc patrem rogare aequum est?
Perii: ex quo censes, nisi ex illo cui data est nuptum, obsecro.

Credo, neque arbitrari patris est aliter. Sed demiror

Partum, praesertim cum and recte and tempore suo peperit;
Adeon' pervicaci esse animo, ut puerum peroptares perire,
Ex quo firmiorem inter nos fore amicitiam posthac scires,
Potius, quam advorsum animi tui libidinem esset cum illo nupta?
Ego etiam illorum esse hanc culpam credidi, quae te est penes.

Misera sum.

Utinam sciam ita esse istuc. Sed nunc mihi in mentem venit,
Ex hac re quod loquuta es olim, cum illum generum cepimus,
Nam negabas nuptam filiam posse tuam te p^^i
Cum eo qui meretricem amaret, qui pernoctaret fo^is.



Multo prius scivi, quam tu, illum habere ^micam, Myrrhin^,
Verum id vitium ego nunquam decrevi esse adolescentiae:
Nam id omnibus innatum est; at pol jam aderit tempus, se quoque etiam cum
oderit
Sed ut olim ostendisti te eandem esse, nihil ces^^visti usque adhuc,

Id nunc indicium haec res facit, quo pacto factum volueris.

Adeon' me esse pervicacem censes, cui matter siem,
Ut eo essem animo, si ex usu esset nostro hoc matrimonium?

Tun' prospicere, aut judicare, nostram in rem quod sit, potes?

Exeuntem aut introeuntem ad amicam: quid tum postea,
Si mode^ e ac raro hoc fecit? non dissimulare nos
Magis humanum est, quam dare operam id scire, qui ^os oderit?
Nam si ipse posset ab ea s^se de repent avellere,

Nec virum satis firmum gnatae.

Mitte adolescentem, obsecro,
Et quae me peccasse ais: abi, solus solum conveni.
Rogas, velitne an non uxorem; si est, ut dicat velle se,
Read sin est autem ut nolit, recte confului meae.

Myrrhina,
Peccatum; aderam, cujus consilio fuerat ea parprospici.
Quamobrem incendor ira te esse ausam facere haec injussu meo.
Interdico, ne extulisse extra aedes puerum usquam ve^^s.
Sed ego stultior meis dictis pare^e hanc qui postulem:


Nullam pol credo mulierem me miseriorem vivere,
Nam ut hic laturus hoc sit, si ipsam ^em ut (...), resciverit,
Non aedipol clam me est, cum hoc quod levius est, tam animo i^acu^d^ tulit,
Nec qua via sententia ejus possit mutari scio.

Si, puerum ut tollam, coget, cujus, nos, qui sit, nescimus, pa^er:
Nam cum compressa est gnata, forma in tenebris, nos^i non quita est;
Neque d^^ractum ^i nunc quic quam est, qui post possit noscere, qui siet:
Ipse erip^it vi, in digito quem habuit virgini abiens annulum.
Pamphilum ne orata nostra nequeat diutius
Celare, cum sciet alienum puerum tolli pro suo.

IT is not unknown to me, my son, that I am suspected by you, that your wife
Is gone away hence because of my demeanor, although you dissemble those
things all you can
But, I swear, and so let those things which I wish befall me from you,
As I never wittingly deserved, that she should justly distaste me:

For your father told me even now within, how you preferred me
Before your love* now I am resolved on the other side to requite your good
(...)
That you may know there is a reward said up for your dutiful ^ction.
My Pamphilus, I think this will be good for you, and for my credit*
I am certainli^ determined to go hence into the country with your father,
Last my presence should be a let; and that no other cause may be left
remaining,
But that your Philum^na may return to you.

What resolution is this, I pray you?
Should you being overcome by her folly remove out of the city into the
country to dwell
You shall not do it; neither will I suffer, that he, mother, that would say
ill of us

Besides, I will not have you to forsake your friends, and kinswomen and
holie-daie
For my sake.

Truly those things afford me no pleasure now;
I discharged my duty sufficiently, whilst the time of my age served; now I
am glutte
With those employments; this is now my great care, that the length of my age

I see I am here hated undeservedlie; it is time to depart;
Thus, as I suppose, I shall very well cut off all alledgments from every
body
And acquit myself of this suspicion, and give way to them.
I pray you let me avoid this thing, for which the common sort of wo^^^ is ill
spoken of


Having this such a (...), and her such a wife!

I pray you, (...) Pamphilus,
(...) you persuade your self to suffer an inconveni^xcie, as any one is
offered
If other things be so as you desire, and she so, as I judge her to be?
Grant (...) this, my son, bring her back again.

Woe is me poor man.



NAm clam me est, gnate ^i, tibi me esse suspectam, uxo^em tuam
Propter meos mores hinc abiisse, etsi ea dissimu^as sedulo.
Verum, ita me Dii ament, itaque ob^ingant ex te quae opto mihi,
Ut nunquam sciens commerui, merito ut caperet odium illa mei;

Nam mihi intus pater tuus narravit modo, quo pacto me habueris
P^aepositum amoti tuo; nu^c tibi me ce^tum est contra gratiam refer
Ut apud me praemium esse positum pietati scias.
Mi Pamphile, hoc and vobis, and meae ^omn odum ^a^^ae arbittor*

Ne mea praesentia obstet; neu causa ulla restet reliqua,
Quin tua Philumena ad te redeat.

Quaeso quid istuc consilii est
Illius stultitia victa, ex urbe tu rus habitatum mig^es?
Haud facies: neque sinam, ut qui robis, matter, maledictum velit,

Tum tuas amicas te, and cognatas deserere and f^stos dies
Mea causa nolo.

Nihil pol jam istaec mihi res voluptatis serunt;
Dum aetatis tempus tulit, perfuncta satis sum; satias jam me tenet
Studiorum istorum; haec mihi nunc cura est ^axima, ut ne c^i meae

Hic video me esse invisam in merito: tempus est concedere;
Sic optume, ut ego opino^, omnes causas praecidam omnibus,
Et m^ hac suspicione exsolvam, and illis morem gessro.
Sine me obsecro hoc efsugere, vulgus quod male audit mulierum.


Hanc matrem habens talem, illam autem ^xor^m!

Ob^o, mi Pamphile,
Non tute incon m^dam rem, ut quaeque est, in ani^m indu^ as pati:
Si caetera ita sunt ut tu vis, itaque ut esse ego illam existimo:
Mignate, da ^eniam hanc mihi, reduce illam.

Vae mifero mihi.



I Have heard, wife, what talk you had with him, as I stood aloof off from
hence
This is wisdom, how you may be able to turn your mind, wheresoever there is
need
If you now shall do that same thing, which you must perhaps do afterward.

God speed us well.

Go into the country then, there I will bear with you, and you with me.



Go in then, and pack up, what you are to carry with you.
I have told you.

I will do as you bid me.

Father.

What would you have, Pamphilus?

That my mother go hence? by no means.

Why would you have that so?

Because I am yet unresolved what to do coucerning my wife.

What is the matter?
What will you do, but bring her back?

Truly I desire it, and can scarcely be withheld,

I believe for that reason they will better agree, if I do not bring her back
again

You know not, you cannot; but it makes no matter to you, whether they do it or
no
When she shall be gone: this age is loathsome to young folks:
It is but reason we depart into an other world. Lastly, we are now become a
tale
Pamphilus, an old man, and an old woman. But I see Phidippus to come forth
In good time. Let us go to him.

QUem cum istoc sermonem habueris, procul hinc stans accepi, uxor.
Istuc est sapere, qui, ubicunque opus sit, animum possis flectere;
Quod faciendum post fortasse, idem hoc nunc si feceris.



I ergo intro, and compone, quae tecum simul ferantur:
Dixi.

Ita ut jubes faciam.

Pater.

Quid vis, Pamphile?

Hinc abire mattem? minime.

Quid ita istuc vis?

Quia de uxore incertus etiam quid (...) facturus.

Quid est?
Quid vis facere, nisi reducere?

Equidem cupio, and vix contineor.

Credo ea gratia, magis concordes, si non reducam, fore.

Nescias, nequeas; verum id tua refert nihil, utrum illae fecerint.
Quando haec abierit: odiosa haec ae^as est adolescentulis.
E medio aequmn excedere est. Postremo, nos jam fabu^ae sumus,
Pamphile, senex atque anus. Sed video Phidippum egredi
Per tempus. Accedamus.

Truly, Philumena, I am angry also with you,
And very much indeed; for in truth it is dishonestlie done of you,
Although you have had an excuse for this matter, a mother that enforced you;
But she has no excuse.

Phidippus you present your self to me very fitly,


What is the matter?

What shall I answer these? or how shall I lay open this thing?

Tell your daughter that Sostrata is going hence into the country,
That she may not fear, that she cannot now return home.

Alas,
Your wife has deserved no blame about these matters:
Myrrhina.

Here is an alteration made.

She troubles us, Laches.

Let them trouble on as much as they will, so that I may not bring her back.

Pamphilus, truly I would have this affinity to be long-lasting Amongst us,
if it can be done

Do you take the child.

He knows she is brought in bed, I am undone.

The child? what child?

We have a grandchild born us.
For my daughter was brought great with child from your house,
Neither did I ever know before this day that she was great with child.


That he is borne you, and that she is in health; but what kind of woman
Have you to wife? or with what conditions is she manoured?
That we should have this concealed from us so long: I cannot sufficiently
Viter how badlie me thinks this is done.

Laches.

Though a good while ago this was doubtful to me,
Now it is not; seeing another man's child follows her.

Pamphilus, there is now no consultation for you here.

I am undone.

We did oftentimes wish to see this day,

It is now come to pass, I thank God.

I am undone.

Bring your wife back again, and be not against me.

Father, if she meant to have children by me,
Or was willing to be married to me, I know very well,

Now when I perceive her mind is estranged from me,
And I think that we shall not hereafter agree betwixt our selves,
Why should I bring her back again?

The young woman did,
What her mother persuaded her to; is that to be wondered at?

Which is without a fault? or is it because men do not amiss?

Do ye your selves consider now, Laches, and you, Pamphilus,
Whether it be requisite for you, that she be sent back, or brought home again.
What my wife does, is not in my power.

But what shall we do with the child?

You ask fondly;
Whatever become of it, give it him, his own I say,
That we may bring up ours.

Whom the father himself has neglected,
Should I bring it up?

What said you? what, shall we not bring it up, Pamphilus?

Truly I cannot now at all hold my peace,
For you make me speak those things which I am loath, whilst he is by,
Do you think that I am ignorant why you weep?
Or what that is at which your are troubled on this manner?

This wife home, because of your mother,
She promised that she would go out of the house.
Now, after you see this excuse will not serve your turn;
Because the child is born unknown to you, you have got another excuse.

What a long time have I given you to love your paramour,
That once now at last you might incline your mind hitherward?
How quietly I have endured the costs which you have bestowed on her?
I have dealt with you, and entreated you to marry a wife;
I told you it was time, by mine enforcement you have married.
Wherein you yielded to me, you did as it became you;
Now again have you set your mind on a where?
Whom you striving to please do wrong to your wife,
For, Pamphilus, I see you are tumbled back again
Into the same kind of life.

What I?

You your self, and you do wrong,
When you feign lying excuses, to cause variance,
That you may live with her, when you have removed this woman being a witness
from you
And your wife has also perceived it; for what other reason had she,
Why she should go from you?

He guesseth very right, for that is it.



Ha,
Bring back your wife again, or tell me, why there is no need of it.

It is not now time.

Take the child, for he indeed
Is in no fault: I will afterward take order for the mother.

I am miserable all kind of ways; neither do I know what I should do,

I will be gone hence, seeing I do little good being present.
For I believe they will not take away the child without my bidding,
Especially seeing my mother-in-law is my helper in that matter.

Are you running away? ho, will you give me no certain answer?

Give me the child Phidippus, I will bring it up.

Yes.
My wife did no wonder, if she took this ill.
Women are spiteful, they do not easily bear these things.
Therefore is this falling out, for she herself told me

Neither did I at first believe her: but now it is manifest;
For I see his mind is quite set against marriage.

What shall I do then, Phidippus? what advice do you give me?

What should you do? I think we must first go to this where.
Let us entreat her, let us accuse her, lastly, let us threaten (...) heartily,
If ever she have to do with him hereafter.

I will do as you advise. Ho boy, run to this Bacchis
Our neighbor, call her forth hither in my (...)*
And I entreat you further that you would be an assistant to me in this matter.

Ah,
Lac^es,
I would have this affinity to last betwixt us,
If it be by any means that it can be, as I hope it will.
But would you have me be by with you, whilst you talk with her?

Nay rather, go your way, and provide some nurse for the child.

TIbi quoque aedipol sum iratus, Philumena,
Graviter quidem; nam hercle abs te est factum turpiter.
Etsi tibi causa est de hac re, matter quae te impulit;
Huic vero nulla est.

Opportune te mihi
Phidippe, in ipso tempore ostendis.

Quid est?

Quid respondebo his? aut quo pacto hoc aperiam?

Dic filiae hinc concessuram rus Sostratam,
Ne vereatur, minus jam quo redeat domum.

Ah,
Nullam de his rebus culpam commeruit tua:
Myrrhina haec sunt mea uxore exorta omnia.

Mutatio fit.

Ea nos perturbat, Laches.

Dum ne reducam, turbent po^o, quam velint.

Ego, Pamphile, esse inter nos, si fieri potest,
Affinitatem hanc sane perpetuam volo;

Accipias puerum.

Sensit peperisse, occidi.

Pu^rum? quem puerum?

Natus est nobis nepos.
Nam abducta a vobis praegnans fuerat filia,
Neque fuisse praegnantem unquam ante hunc s^ivi diem.


Natum illum tibi, and illam salvam; sed quid mulieris
Uxorem habes? aut quibus moratam moribus?
Nos ne hoc celatos tam diu; nequeo satis
Quam hoc mihi videtur factum prave, proloqui.

Laches.

Etsi jam dudum fuerat ambig^um hoc miai,
Nunc non est, cum eam consequitur alienus pue^*

Nulla tibi, Pamphile, hic jam consultatio est.

Perii.

Hunc videre saepe optabamus diem,

Evenit, habeo gratiam Diis.

Nullus sum.

Reduc uxorem, ac noli adversari mihi.

Pater, si illa ex me liberos vellet sibi,
Aut se esse mecum nuptam, satis certo scio,

Nunc cum ejus alienum a me animum sentiam,
Neque conventurum inter nos posthac esse arbitror,
Quam ob rem reducam?

Matter quod suasit sua,
Adolescens mulier fecit: mirandumne id est?

Quae careat culpa? an quia non delinquunt viti?

Vosmet videte jam, Laches, and tu Pamphile,
Remissan' opus sit vobis, reductan' domum:
U^or quid faciet in manu non est mea.

Sed quid faciemus puero?

Ridicule rogas?
Quicquid futurum est, huic reddas; suum scilicet,
Ut alamus nostrum.

Quem ipse neglexit pater,
Ego alam?

Quid dixti? eho, annon alemus, Pamphile?

Enimvero prorsus jam tacere non queo,
Nam cogis ea quae nolo, ut, praesente hoc, loquar.
Ignarum censes tuarum lachrymarum esse me?
Aut quid sit hoc id quod solicitere ad hunc modum?

Matrem non posse habere hanc uxorem domi;
Pollicita est ea se concessuram aedibus.
Nunc, postquam adempta^ hanc quoque causam vides,
Puer quia clam te est natus, nactus alteram es;

Aliquando tandem huc animum ut adducas tuum,
Quam longum spacium amandi amicam tibi dedi?
Sumptus, quos fecisti in ea, quam animo aequo tuli?
Egi atque oravi tecum uxorem ut duceres,

Quae tum obsecutus mihi, fecisti ut decuerat,
Nunc animum rursum ad meretricem induxisti tuum:
Cui tu obsequutus facis huic adeo injuriam,
Nam in eandem vitam te revolutum denuo


Mean?

Teipsum. Et facis injuriam
Cum fingis falsas causas ad discordiam,
Uttu cum illa vivas, testem hanc cum abs te amoveris.
Sensitque adeo uxor; nam ei causa alia quae fuit,
Quamobrem abs te abiret?

Plane hic divinat: id est.



Ha,
Reduc uxorem, aut quamobrem non opus sit, cedo.

Non est nunc tempus.

Puerum accipias, nam is quide^
In culpa non est; post de matre videro.

Omnibus modis miser sum; nec quid agam, scio.

Abibo hinc, praesens quando promoveo parum.
Nam puerum injussu credo non tollent meo^
Praesertim in ea re cum sit mihi adjutrix socrus.

Fugis? hem, nec quicquam certi respondes mihi?

Puerum, Phidippe, mihi cedo, ego alam.

Maxume.
Non mirum fecit uxor mea, si hoc aegre tulit:
Amarae mulieres sunt, non facile haec^erunt.
Propterea haec ira est, nam ipsa narravit mihi:

Neque illi credebam primo; nunc vero palam est;
Nam omnino abhor^ere animum huic video a nuptiis.

Quid ergo agam, Phidippe? quid das consilii?

Quid agas? meretricem hanc primum adeunda^ censeo.
Oremus, accusemus, gratius denique minitemur
Si cum illo habuerit rem postea.

Faciam ut mones; eho puer, curre ad Bacchidem hanc
Vicinam nostram; huc evoca verbis meis.
Et te oro porro in hac re adjutor ut sis mihi.

Ah,

Manner affinitatem hanc inter nos volo,
Si ullo modo est, ut possit, quod spero fore.
Sed visne me adesse una, dum istam convenis?

Immo abi, aliquam puero nutricem para.

THis is not for nothing, that Laches desires not to speak with me,
And truly I am not much mistaken, but it is that which I suspect what he
would

I must have a care, l^st I obtain less through anger, then I may^
And that I do nothing more, which may afterward be better for me not to have
done
Bacchis, God save you.

God save you,

ches:

Truly: Bacchis,
I believe you somewhat marvail what the matter is, wherefore I commanded the
bo
To call you out of doors hither.

I am indeed also fearful, when I remember
Who I am, left the report of gain should prejudice me with you. For
I can easily justify my conditions.

If you say true, I will do you no harm, woman,

Wherefore I do the more warily consider every thing, that I may do nothing
rashly
For if now you do, or are likely to do, that which it becomes honest women to
do
It were unjust for me unwittinglie to offer you a wrong who do not deserve it.

Truly it is great thanks that I give you for this matter.

But what is the matter?

You entertain my son Pamphilus to your house.

Alas.

Let me speak. Before he married this wife, I bore with your love.
Tarry, I have not yet said what I would: he now has a wife,
Seek for your self another and surer friend, whilst you have time to consult.


Who says it?

His mother in law.

That I entertain him?

That you your self do it, and she has had away her daughter;
And would for that reason have privilie made away the child, which is born.

If I knew any other thing, whereby I might make you believe me,
More holy then an oath, I would assure you, Laches,


You are a lovelie woman, but do you know what I would rather have you do?

Tell me, what would you have?

That you go in hither to the women, and there offer that same oath to them:
Satisfy their minds, and acquit your self of this fault.

I will do it, but if indeed it were another of this trade, she would not do
it, I know

But I am loath to have your son suspected on a false report,
Or to se^m without cause more inconstant to you, who ought not to think him so;
For he has deserved of me, that I should pleasure him, ^l I can.

Your discourse has made us favorable and well willing (...) toward you,

Now seeing I have found you to be otherwise then we thought you were,
See you be the same woman you were, and further make use of our friendship as
you please
If yo do otherwise -- But I will refrain my self, that you may not hear any
thing unkindly from me
But this one thing I advise you, that you would rather (...) what (...) friend
I may be


I will do my utmost.

NOn hoc de nihilo est, quod Laches me nunc contentam esse expetit.
Nec pol me multum fallit, quin sit, quod suspicor quid velit.

Videndum est, ne minus propter iram impetrem quam possim,
Aut ne quid faciam plus, quod me post minus fecisse satius sit.


Salve, Laches.

Credo aedipol
Te nonnihil mirari Bacchis, quid sit quapropter te huc soras puerum
Evocare jussi.

Ego pol quoque timida sum, cum venit mihi
Inmentem quae sum, ne nomen mihi quaestus obstet apud te; nam mores
Facile tutor.

Si vera dicis, nihil tibi est a me pericli, mulier.

Quo magis res omnes cautius, n^ temere faciam, accuro:
Nam si id nunc facis, facturave es, bonas quod par est facere,
Inscitum offerre injuriam me tibi immerenti iniquum est.

Est magna ecastor gratia de hac re quam tibi habeam,

Sed quid istuc est?

Meum receptas filium ad te Pamphilum.

Ah.

Sine dicam, Uxorem priusquam hanc duxit, vestrum amorem pertuli.
Mane: nondum etiam dixi hoc quod volui; hic nunc uxorem habet,
Quaere alium tibi firmiorem amicum, dum tempus consulendi est.


Quis id ait?

Socrus.

Mean?

Teipsam, and filiam abduxit suam,
Puerumque ob eam rem clam voluit, natus qui est, extinguere.

Aliud si scirem, qui firmare meam apud vos possem fidem,
Sanctius quam jusjurandum, id pollicerer tibi, Laches;


Lepida es, sed scin' quid volo potius facias?

Quid vis, cedo?

Eas ad mulieres huc intio, atque istuc jusjurandum idem
Polliceare illis: exple animum his, teque hoc crimine expedi.

Faciam, quod pol si esset alia ex hoc quaestu, h^d faceret, scio;

Sed nolo esse falsa fama gnatum suspectum tuum,
Nec leviorem vobis, quibus est minime aequum, viderier
Immerito: nam meritus de me est, quod queam, illi ut commodem.

Facilem benevolumque lingua tua me jam tibi reddidit;

Nunc cum ego te esse praeter nostram opinionem comperi,
Pac eadem ut sis, porro nostra utere amicitia ut velis.
Aliter si facis -- Sed reprimam me, ne aegre quidquam ex me audias;
Verum hoc te moneo unum, qualis sim amitus, aut quid possiem,


Faciam sedulo.

I Will not suffer you to want any thing from me, but it shall be bountifully
afforded, what you stand in need of
But when you shall have eaten and drunken enough, see that the child be
filled

Our sons father in law comes, I see him; he has brought a nurse for the
child
Phidippus, Bacchis swears very devoutlie.

Is this she?

This is she.



I deliver you my maids, search it out by any torment for me; you may do it,
This matter is here in hand; I must bring it about, that his wife return
To Pamphilus: which if I do effect, the report does not i^k me,
That I alone have done that, which other whores shun to do.


Have been falsely suspected by us; now let us further try this (...)man,
For if your wife shall find out that she has falsely believed accusation;
She will let go her anger; but if my son be angry for that matter,
Because his wife was brought a bed unknown to him, that is a s^ matter, this
anger will quickly be gone from him


I wish indeed it were so.

Examine her, here she is: she will do what may be sufficient.

I will.

Why do you tell me these things? is it because you your self,
Laches, heard long ago,
How my mind stands concerning this matter? only satisfy their minds, that
they may believe

I pray you Bacchis, that what your self have promised me, you would perform it.



Co, and satisfy their minds, that they may believe.

I go, although I know indeed, they will not abide the sight of me to day.
For a married woman is an enemy to a whore, when she is parted from her
husband

But these will be your friends, when they shall know, wherefore you are come.

But I engage to you that they will be your friends, when they shall know the
matter


I am undone, I am ashamed of Philumena: do ye both follow me in hither.

What ^it that I desire rather to my self, then that which I perceive does
befall her
That she may get favor without any hinderance to her, and do me good?
For if it be that she has now really parted Pamphilus from her,

And she will recompense him, and make us friends to her all under one.

NIhil apud me tibi de^ieri patiar, quin, quod opus sit, benign praebeatur.
Sed cum satura atque ebria eris, puer ut satur sit, facito.

Noster socer, video, venit: puero nutricem adduxit.
Phidippe, Bacchis dejerat persancte.

Haeccine (...) est?

Haec est.



Ancillas dedo, quolibet cruciatu per me exquire, licet,
Haec res hic agitur: Pamphilo me facere ut redeat uxor
Oportet; quod si perficio, non poenitet me famae,
Solam ^ecisse id quod aliae meretrices facere fugitant.


Nobis in re ipsa invenimus: porro hanc nunc experiamur.
Nam si compererit crimini tua se uxor falso credidisse,
Missam iram faciet; sin autem est ob eam rem iratus g^tus,
Quod peperir uxor clam, id leve est, cito ab eo haec ira abscedet.


Velim quidem her^le.

Exquire, adest: quod satis sit faciet ipsa.

Faciam.

Quid mihi istaec narras? an quia non tute ipse audisti dudum,
De hac re animus meus ut sit, Laches? illis modo exple animum, ut credant.

Quaeso aedipol Bacchis, quod mihi es pollicita tute ut serves.



I, atque exple animum his, ut credant.

Eo, etsi scio pol his fore meum conspectum invisum, hodie,
Nam nupta meretrici hostis est, a viro ubi segregata est.

At hae amicae erunt, ubi quamobrem adveneris, resciscent.

Atqui easdem amicas fore tibi promitto, rem ubi cognoverin^


Perii, pudet Philumenae me, sequimini me intro huc ambae:

Quid est quod mihi malim, quam quod huic intelligo evenire,
Ut gratiam ineat sine suo dispendio, and mihi prosit?
Nam si est ut haec nunc Pamphilum vere ab se segregarit,

Referetque gratiam ei, unaque opera nos sibi amicos junget.

Truly my master accounts my labor to be little worth,
Who has sent me a sleeveless errant to no purpose, where I sat idelie all
the day
Whilst I expected Callimedes the Myconian host in the Tower;
And so whilst I sat there to day like a fool, as any one came,

(He said) I am not. But are you Callimedes? No. Have you a guest here
One Pamphilus? They all said nay, nor do I think he was any man at all.
At last truly now I was ashamed; I went away: but why do I see Bacchis
Coming out from our kinsmans? what business has she here?



Why thither?

Tell him I entreat him to come.

To you?

Nay to Philumena.

What is the matter?

Forbear to ask, that which nothing concerns you.

Should I say
Nothing else?

Yes, that Myrrhina owned that ring


I know it.
Is that such a weighty matter?

Such a weighty matter. He will be here presently, after he has heard this
from you
But do you boyter?

No indeed, for I have no such ability granted me to day,
I have so spent this whole day in running and walking up and down.

What jollitie have I brought Pamphilus to day by, my coming?

I restore him his son, who was almost lost by their means and his;
I help him to his wife again, whom he thought he should never have hereafter.
I have freed him from that for which he was suspected by his father and
Phidippus
Thus the ring was the first occasion of the finding out these things;

As soon as it was night, puffing and blowing, without any body with him,
full of wine
With this ring; I was afraid presently; O my Pamphilus, said I, of all love
I pray you, why are you dismayed? or whence got you this ring?
Tell me; he minded other matters, and dissembled: after I saw

The fellow confessed that he had ravished a maid, I know not whom, by the way,
And that he pulled off her ring whilst he strugled with her:
This Myrrhina owned it even now on my finger; she asked me as I had it,
Whence I got it; I tell her all these passages; thence it comes to be known,

I am glad that these so many joys are befaln him through me;
Although other where is are unwilling to this; for it is not for our profit,
That any lover should have joy in his marriage; but indeed
I will give my mind to bad dealing for lucre sake.

It falls out ill for me from the marriage; I confess it is done,
But truly I think I have done it, lest that should justly befall me;
It is but reason to bear some losses of him, from whom you have received many
benefits

AE Dipol nae meam herus esse operam deputat parvi pretii,
Qui ob rem nullam misit frustra ubi totum d^^^di diem,
Myconium hospitem dum exspecto in art Callidomide^
Ita que ineptus hodie dum illic sedeo, ut quisque v^

Non sum. At Callidemides? Non. hospitem ecquem Pamphilum
Hic habes? omnes negabant, neque cum quenquam essa arbitror.
Denique hercle jam pudebat: abii, sed quid Bacchidem
Ab nostro affine exeuntem video? quid huic hic est rei?



Quid eo?

Dic me orare ut veniat.

A^?

Immo ad Philumenam.

Quid rei est?

Tua quod nihil refert, percontari desinas.

Nihil aliud
Dicam?

Etiam: cognosse annulum illum Myrrhinam,


Scio.
Tantumne est?

Tantum. Aderit continuo, hoc ubi ex te audierit.
Sed cessas?

Minime equidem. Nam hodie mihi potestas haud data est,
Ita cursando atque ambulando totum hunc contrivi diem.

Quantam obtuli adventu meo laetitiam Pamphilo ^odie?

^natum ei restituo, qui pene harum ipsiusque opera periit;
U^orem, quam nunquam est posthac ratus se habiturum, reddo.
Quare suspectus suo patri and Phidippo fuit, exsolvi.
Hic adeo his rebus annulus fuit initium inveniundis;

Confugere anh^lantem domum, sine comite, vini plenum,
Cum hoc annulo; extimui illico; mi Pamphile, inquam, amabo,
Quid es examinatus, obsecro? aut unde annulum istum nactus?
Dic mihi: ille alias res agere, simulare; postquam video,

Homo se fatetur vi in via virginem nescio quam compressisse,
Dicitque sese illi annulum dum luctatur detraxisse:
Eum haec cognovit Myrrhina in digito modo; me habentem
Rogat unde sit; narro omnia haec: inde est cognitio facta,

Haec tot propter me gaudia illi contigisse laetor:
Etsi hoc meretrices aliae nolunt, neque enim est in rem nostram,
Ut quisquam amator nuptiis laetetur; verum ecastor,
Nunquam animum quaesti gratia ad malas adducam parts,

Incommode mihi nuptiis evenit; factum fateor;
At pol me fecisse arbitror, ne id meri^ O mihi eveniret;
Multa ex quo fuerint commoda, ejus incommoda aequum est far.

Look to it, my Parmeno, again I pray thee, that thou bring me these things
true and evident
Lest you cast me for this short time into a fools paradise.

I have looked to it.

Is it true?

True indeed.

I am happy, if it be so.

You will find it true.

Tarry a while, I pray you; I am afraid, left I believe one thing, and you
tell me another



I think you said thus: that Myrrhina has found
That Bacchis has her ring.

I did so.

That which I gave her long ago;
And did she bid you to tell me this? is it done so?

Yes so, I say.

Who is more happy then I? and fuller also of good luck?
What should I bestow on you for this news? what? what? I know not.



What?

Nothing forsooth;
For I know not what benefit there is to you, either in my message, or in my
self

Should I suffer you to go away from me without a reward,
Who have fetched me back, being a dead man, from hells darkness to light? ab,
you think me too ungrateful
But behold I see Bacchis stand before the door,


God save you, Pamphilus,

O Bacchis, O my Bacchis, the preserver of my life.

It is well done, and it is a pleasure to me.

You make me believe you by your doings,
And withal you keep your old grace,
That your meeting, your discourse, your coming, is always pleasant,


And you indeed keep your old w^nt and disposition,
That there is not any one man among all men alive more fair-spoken then you.

Ha, ha, he, tell you me that?

You have done well, Pamphilus, to love your wife.
For I never, that I know on, beheld her with my eyes before this day;
She looks like a very good gentlewoman.

Say true.

I swear, Pamphilus.



Nothing.

Neither is it needful.
So be whisht. I like that this may not be done as it is in Comedies,
Where every body knows all things; those know, for whom it is meet
They should know; but they for whom it is not fitting they should know,
neither shall hear it, nor know it

Nay verily, I will tell you, how you may more easily believe this may be
kept close

And that you therefore was out of all suspicion with her.

It is very well.
And I hope this thing will come to pass according to our mind.

Master, may I know from you what good that is that I have done you to day?
Or what that is that you are about?

You may not.

Yet I guess.


You know not, Parmeno,
How much good you have done me to day, and from what great trouble you have
rid me

Yes indeed I know it, neither did I do this unwittinglie.

I know that well enough.

Can
Any thing pass by Parmeno rashly, which is needful to be done?

Follow me in Parmeno.

I follow you. Truly I have done more good to day


VIde, mi Parmeno etiam sodes, ut mihi haec certa and clara attuleris:
Ne me in breve hoc conjicias tempus, gaudio hoc falso frui.

Visum est.

Certene?

Certe.

Deus sum, si hoc ita est.

Verum reperies.

Manedum, sodes, timeo ne aliud credam atque aliud nuncies.



Sic te dixisse opinor: invenisse Myrrhinam
Bacchidem annulum suum habere.

Factum.

Eum quem ei olim dedi:
Eaque haec te mihi nunciare jussit? itane est factum?

Ita, inquam.

Quis me est fortunatior, venustatisque adeo plenior?
Egone pro hoc te nuncio quid donem? quid? quid? nescio.



Quid?

Nihil enim;
Nam neque in nuncio, neque in meipso, tibi quid sit boni, scio.

Egone, qui ab Orco mortuum me in lucem reducem feceris,
Sinam sine munere a me abire? ah, nimium me ingratum putas.
Sed Bacchidem ectam video stare ante ostium,


Salve, Pamphile,

O Bacchis, o mea Bacchis, servatrix mea.

Been factum and volupe est.

Factis ut credam facis;
Antiquamque adeo tuam venustatem obtines,
Ut voluptati obitus, sermo, adventus tuus, quocumque adveneris,


At tu ecastor morem antiquum atque ingenium obtines,
Ut unus hominum homo te vivat nunquam quisquam blandior.

Ha, ha, he, tun' mihi istuc?

Recte amasti, Pamphile, uxorem tuam;
Nam nunquam ante hunc diem meis oculis eam quod nossem, videram.
Perliberalis visa est.

Dic verum.

Ita me Dii ament, Pamphile.



Nihil.

Neque opus est.
Adeo mutito. Placet non fieri hoc itidem ut in Comoediis,
Omnia ubi omnes resciscunt; hi, quos par fuerat resciscere,
Sciunt: quos non autem est aequum scire, neque resciscent, neque scient.

Immo etiam, qui hoc occultari facilius credas, dabo.

Se fidem habuisse, and propterea te sibi purgatum.

Optume est.
Speroque hanc rem esse eventuram nobis ex sententia.

Here, licetne me scire ex te hodie quid sit quod feci boni?
Aut quid istuc est quod vos agitis?

Non licet.

Tamen suspicor.


Nescis, Parmeno,
Quantum hodie profueris mihi, and ex quanta aerumna extraxeris.

Immo vero scio, neque hoc imprudens feci.

Ego istuc satis scio.

An
Temere quicquam Parmenonem praetereat, quod facto usus sit?

Sequere me intro, Parmeno.

Sequor. Equidem plus hodie boni
