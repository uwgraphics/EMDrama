TO what hard Laws you Comic Writers bind,
Who must at every turn new humor find;
Though the great Masters of the former Age,
Had all the choice of humor for the Stage:
And they that plenteous Harvest reaped so clean,
Their Successors can little else but glean.
Frolic, and Cockwood yet were good and new,
And the Plain-dealer, and Sir Foplin you
Have seen, and justly have applauded too.
Our Author some new humor did produce,
But look not for an unexhausted Cruse.
The task each day grows harder than before;
For as good Poets have brought forth great store,
So Fellows of no Genius, with much Toil,
Still Sweat for humor, which they always spoil:
And by their hints good Comic Pens prevent,
As Whelps stanch Hounds, by foyling of the scent.
^hese wretched Poetitos, who got praise
For writing most confounded Loyal Plays,
With viler, courser Jests than at Bear-Garden,
And silly Grubstreet Songs worse than Tom Farthing.
If any Noble Patriot did excel
His own, and Country's Rights defending well,
^hese yelping Currs were straight loo'd on to bark,
(...) the deserving Man to set a mark.
(...) abject, fawning Parasites and Knaves,
^ince they were such, would have all others Slaves,
It Was precious Loyalty that was thought fit
(...) atone for want of Honesty and Wit.
No wonder Common Sense was all cried down,
And Noise and Nonsense swagger'd through the Town*
Our Author then oppressed, would have you know it,
Was Silenced for a Nonconformist Poet:
In those hard times he bore the utmost test,
And now he Swears he is Loyal as the best.
Now Sirs, since Common Sense has won the day,
Be kind to this, as to his last years Play.
His Friends stood firmly to him when distressed;
He hopes the number is not now decreased:
He found esteem from those he valued most,
Proud of his Friends, he of his Foes could boast.
To all you. Bury Sparks, he bid me say
That every Part is Fiction in his Play;
Particular Reflections there are none,
Our Poet knows not one in all your Town.
If any has so very little Wit
To think a Fop's dress can his Person fit,
Even let him take it, and make much of it.

NOW I hope, Sir, you will acknowledge you see a sweet Town, clean, and finely
Situated, in a delicate Air; here I was Born, here I Sucked my first Breath


Thus every Coxcomb is big with the praise of the Country and Place of his
Nativity


All the World says as much of St. Edmand's Bury.


There is indeed some Truth in this; but it is not thou, but the Town, is in the
right: for thou would have recommended the Air of the worst Town in the
Hundreds of Essex, had thou Sucked thy first breath in it, as thou say.
But one thing I can tell of thy Town, That it can produce a Blockhead


You may say what you please of me, Sir, but there are so many fine Gentlemen
and Ladies, so Gallant, and so well bred, we call it little London; and it
out-does St. James's Square, and all the Squares, in Dressing and Breeding;
nay, even the Court it self, under the Rose


I doubt not, but they are given to outdo, as all Imitators are.


Well, you London Wits, will never give any Man, nor any thing, a good Word.


You impudent Rascal! Wit, say you! What, do you call me Names? I had as leive
be called a Pick-pocket, as a Wit. A Wit is always a Merry, Idle, Waggish
Fellow, of no Understanding: Parts indeed he has, but ^he had better be without
'em: Your solid Fop is a better Man; he will be Diligent and Fawning, always in
the way, and with his Blockhead do his business at last; but your Wit will
either neglect all Opportunities for Pleasure, or if he brings his business
into a hopeful way, he will laugh at, or draw his Wit upon some great Man or
other, and spoil all


Would I were a Wit for all that. But to give you an Example of the Wit and
Breeding of our Town; there is the Lady Fantast, and her Daughter


The most perpetual, impertinent, prattling, conceited, affected Jades, that
ever plagued Mankind


Mercy on me! Impertinent! Why, they are the Flower of Bury. Is not the young
Lady a Beauty too


I must confess, God has given her one good Face; but by her most insupportable
Affectation, she screws it into twenty bad ones. She has naturally a good
Complexion, becoming good Features; and she, by Art, makes her Face look like a
new White Wall with a Red Lettice


I hope, you will grant Mr. Oldwit is a fine Facetious, Witty, Old Gentleman, my
Lady Fantast's Husband


Almost as arrant an Ass, as thou art. He is a paltry Old-fashioned Wit, and
Punner of the last Age; that pretends to have been one of Ben John* son's Sons,
and to have seen Plays at the Blackfryers


You Will be Stoned in the Streets, Sir, if you talk thus in Bury. I warrant, you
will not allow Sir Humphrey Noddy to be a Wit, and a fine Gentleman


A Blunt, Noisy, Laughing, Roaring, Drinking Fellow; as troublesome as a Monky,
and as Witless as a Jackdaw. He is, at best, but a Wag


Well, Sir, say what you please, he is a fine Gentleman, and will make a Man
burst a Vein to keep him Company; he has Wit at will, that is certain


If the Rogue had no more Money at will, he would dye in a Ditch.


Will no body at Bury please you? What think you of Mr. Trim? he is accounted
the finest Gentleman in all Bury, for Breeding and Civility, and the like


Now you have hit on it: He is a most Complete, and finished Fop: Nature has not
been negligent, nor Art been Idle, in his Composition. He is very Wise,
Reserved, full of Forms, and empty of Substance; all Ceremony, and no Sense:
more troublesomly ill-bred with his Formality, than a High-shoo'd Peasant with
his Roughness. Sir Noddy and he are two excellent Fops in Consort


Fops! Mercy upon me! You will be accounted a Madman, if you talk thus at Bury.


Yes, among Fools.


Why, they are those that carry all the Town before 'em.


No doubt on it, I never knew a Town yet, wherein the Fops do not carry all
before 'em: They are a numerous, Impudent, and Noisy Party; while the Wise and
Ingenious are Few, Modest and Reserved. There are Men of Wit, Honor, and
Breeding; and Women of great Wit, Beauty, and Ingenuity, and Well-bred too, in
this Town, which is really a sweet Town; but these pretend to nothing: Your
pretenders never have any thing in 'em


Hold, Sir, here is Mr. Trim.


Sweet Mr. Wildish! I am your most humble Servant; and cannot but congratulate
those auspicious Stars that brought you hither, to render this Town, and your
Friends in it, happy by your presence


You do me Honor, Sir.


Coming abroad to participate of the freshness of the Morning, among our Bury
Gallants; the thrice fortunate rencounter with one of your Train, put me in
mind of paying that Tribute of my Service which I long have wished to pay: But
my wishes have often been frustrated, for want of that happy opportunity of
kissing your hands, which I now enjoy


Your great Civilities are surprising; really your Generosity is as much beyond
my expectation, as it is above my Merit. What an Engine is this Fop


It is impossible that we of Bury, who I may say with modesty enough, have no
small Fame for Breeding and Civility, can ever be so obnoxious to that
Stupidity, or neglect of either, as not to value the great Honor done to us,
and the cohonestation of us, by your arrival at Bury at this time of the Fair:
Which will add to the wonted gayety and Splendor of the Place and Season


You astonish me, with your most admirable Address, and Complaisance: and I
think there lives not, among the race of Mankind, a person more skilful in all
Decencies of Behavior, compleatness of Expression, Gestures of Body,
Modulations of Voice, and all those Arts of Modish Gallantry, which might
render a man the Mirror of Courts, and the Wonder and Example of all other
places.


Rarely done on both sides! Oh how their Tongues are hung!


Be pleased to sit.


Oh Lord, Sir, while you are on your Feet! Sure I can never live to be blotted
with that odious Soloecism in Manners. Nay, Sir, I beseech you


Sir, you will catch cold.


I had rather catch any thing, than the Infamy of ill Breeding.


Well, Sir, how stand Affairs at Bury?


Singularly well, Sir; the amenity of our Situation, together with the equal
Temperature of the Climate, produces in us that serenity of Mind, that Bury
seems to be the Habitation of the Graces and the Muses


Bury indeed seems to be the Scene of Beauty, Wit and Breeding.


It Is a great Honor to us, to hear this pronounced by a Person, who is no less
Eminent in Wit, than celebrated for Humanity, and Decency of Deportment


A Pox on this Puppy! Two such more, would drive me out of Bury, before I see
my Mistress, the Creature of the World I am most passionately in Love with


You, that make so noble a Figure among the nimble and quick Spirits of the
Age, and are such a Top Wit, that all England rings out your Fame


Pr'y thee, Mr. Trim, what e're you do, don't call me a Wit; it is good for
nothing in this Age, but to undo a Man: I shall be hunted for a Wild Beast. But
pray, what Lady rides Admiral here at Bury


O Lord! who should, but Madam Fantast, the sweet Lady Fantast's Daughter? a
Paragon of Beauty, and a Mirror of Wit and Breeding! at once the Envy and
Wonder of the Sex and Age! She bears the Flag of Wit and Breeding on the main
Topsail of her Beauty.


How does Mr. Oldwit's young Daughter? I saw her in London last Easter-Term:
She is the prettiest Charming Creature my Eyes ever beheld


She is indeed a pretty Bud of Beauty: and if she Blossoms under the Sunshine
of my Lady Fantast's Favor, and her Daughters Example, she will flourish;
otherwise not


Very concise and dogmatical. Fantast's.


I, I am her humble Admirer, her Adorer: I call her Dorinda, and she honors me
with the name of Eugenius. I visit her daily


Nicknames and Visits! then there is somewhat more between you, in faith Mr. Trim.


Upon my Honor, nothing but a certain creeping correspondence; a Conversation
that savours somewhat of Gallantry, mixed now and then with Ombre, Crimp,
Comet, or Uncertain; and sometimes we read an Author, or so


Or so! Hark in your Ear.


Sir, I am astonished to think I shoud be obnoxious to that Infelicity to be so
mistaken: and I must tell you, Sir, I scorn your words


I did not think it had been a Dishonor to a man to lie with a pretty woman.


I would not for the whole World: Nor ever did. Mistake me not, unless I were
Married


What a Devil do we all run after 'em, and keep 'em company for, and Dance, and
play the Fool, but in ordine ad


I visit all the Ladies for their Conversation, for the excellence of their
Conversation


Conversation! That is so frivolous, it were not to be born, but for something
else that shall be nameless: and I Will tell you one thing, Mr. Trim, That any
Woman you keep company with, who does not think you have a mind to lie with
her, will never forgive you, to my knowledge


Their Conversation does infinitely transcend men's, I assure you: I have
studied the Sex


I Will tell you one thing more: That you must never be alone with a Woman, but
you must offer, or she knows you care not for her: Five to one but she grants:
But if she does not care for you, but denies, she is certain by that you care
for her, and will esteem you the better ever after


Oh uncharitable Sentence!


Come, you and I Will sup together, and be merry; and two or three Bottles will
make you freer, and more open-hearted


I never Sup: We of the better Rank never Sup, at Bury.


How? not Sup!


No.


Nor drink a Bottle?


Never between Meals: We do indeed divert our selves with some Milk-Pottage in
the Evening; that is all


Now, now this Rogue's my Rival: I shall Tease him, ere I have done with him.


Sir Humphrey, forbear; I pray forbear: You Will be the death of me.


How now? what, will not this Fool cut the other Fool over the Pate? Shall I
have no Sport with 'em


I shall break a Vein, if I keep you company, you arch Wag you. Mr. Wildish, I
am come to kiss your hands: you are welcome to Bury-Fair


Sir, I am your most humble Servant: you honor me with this Visit.


Dear Ned, let me kiss thee! Ah, Ned, that night I saw thee at Newmarket!


Which was the first night I ever saw the Puppy.


I shall never forget it. Ah, 'twas the merriest Night!


Ay, 'twas so: we talked of nothing but Cocks, Dogs, and Horses.


Not a word. 'Twas the bravest Night! But I was too hard for, and out vapour'd
all the Jockeys and Cockers; and after that I hunted over a bottle. Here
Jowler; hey Venus! and we roared so till four in the Morning; that, Gad take
me, between you and me, I was deaf on both Ears for three weeks after; I have
scarce recovered one Ear yet. I would give Fifty pound for such another night


Sir, I must tell you, your Deportment is very undecent, and savours much of
ill Breeding: And I would desire you would please to explain your self, in this
particular


Puh! Waggery, mere Waggery. Dear Jack, kiss me: Honest Jack, I love to be
familiar with my Friends. Jack, Jack, dear Jack! nowns Jack


Jack, Jack, Jack! Familiar! I must tell you, Sir, I cannot brook the Roughness
of your Demeanor; the consequences whereof may produce those effects, as may
not be agreeable to those decencies required in Conversation. But I shall at
present take my leave, and visit Ladies, Sir, I kiss your hands


Sir, your most humble Servant.


Mr. Oldwit, I am your most faithful Servant.


Your Servant, sweet Mr. Trim. Well, Sir Humphrey Noddy, go thy ways; thou art
the Archest Wit and Wag! I must forswear thy Company: thou wilt kill me else


Hanged, a pox on it, what is this World worth, without wit, and waggery, and
Mirth? I love to be merry


Plague on him; his Mirth is the melancholiest thing in the world.


You saw, Mr. Wildish, how I run down Fellows at Newmarket, with my Jests and
my Tricks: They took me for a Put; but I outroar'd 'em all, in faith, and could
have put them all in a Mouse-hole


How does my Lord, your dear Friend, and Patron?


Oh, Sir, his Lordship is in good Health. He is no body without we poor Man: he
loves Wit, and good Company; I Will tell you, I Will tell you --


Now we shall hear some Wit and Waggery!


'T'other day we were a Hunting, and at a cold Scent; one of his Gentlemen
being alighted, stood by a Plash of Water: I sneaked behind, and pushed him, I
vow to Gad, up to the Knees


Good, Good: Ha, ha, ha.


Ha, ha, ha. But, if you had seen his Lordship laugh: the Water trickled down
his Honors Cheeks: then one Jeremy stood staring; I called him loudly and
suddenly, and held my Fingers thus: he turned suddenly, and hit his Nose such a
Bump, that all the Blood gushed out. Ha, ha, ha


Look you there: Ha, ha* ha. Well, well.


But if you had seen his Honor Chuckle and Laugh, till he was black in the
Face! I twirl'd another Fellows Hat over a little River, that was not
Navigable; and he was forced to go a Mile about to fetch it: I thought my Lord
would have killed himself! He desired me at last to forbear; he was not able to
endure it


My Lord is a very merry Man.


Ay, Gad take me, as any's upon the face of the Earth. But, how goes Wit at
London


You are the chief Genius, the high Wit of the Age.


Prithee, Mr. Oldwit, lay not that to my charge; you had as good accuse me of
Felony


Never talk of that, your Pen has betrayed you; and we look upon you here, to
be the choicest Wit of the Times


And, in faith, we can show you Wit at Bury too.


What, a Devil, you wont make a Wit of me, in spite of my Teeth, will you?


No, Nature has made you a Wit. Why do you take it ill? I think it the
greatest Honor can be done to a Man. I my self, simple as I stand here, was a
Wit in the last Age: I was created Ben Iohnson's Son, in the Apollo. I knew
Fletcher, my Friend Fletcher, and his Maid Joan: Well, I shall never forget
him, I have Supped with him, at his House, on the Bankside: He loved a fat Loyn
of Pork of all things in the World: and Joan, his Maid, had her Beerglass of
Sack; and we all kissed her, in faith, and were as merry as passed


This was enough to make any Man a Wit.


Puh! this was nothing: I was a Critic at Blackfriers; but at Cambridge, none
so great as I, with Jack Cleaveland: But Tom Randol and I were Hand and Glove:
Tom was a brave Fellow; the most Natural Poet


They were brave Fellows, but you Wits now a days, out-top them all.


Zounds, I will have nothing to do with Wit, I tell you!


Pshaw, pshaw! but I was telling you, you have seen many pretty things, that
were written in those Times, that were mine. For Example: One Mr. Murial, a
Fellow of Pembroke-Hall, had a Horse dyed; I writ this upon it. Now Cruel Mor
Has ta'n the Horse
Of Mr. Murial:
Ye Scholars all,
Of Pembroke-Hall,
Come to his Burial.
Ha! hum! hum! Nay, I was good at Epitaphs, both of Man and Beast.


Ha, ha, ha; admirable good, in faith, Mr. Oldwit!


Why, this was Wit all over! You were an errant Wit!


And that Translation too was mine.

Mittiur in disco mihi Piscis ab Archiepisco
Po, non ponatur quia potus non mihi datur.
I sent a Fish,
In a great Dish,
To the Archbish.
Hop was not there,
Because he gave me no Beer.
Was not that Lucky? Ha? humh? anon?


Most incomparable:


I was such a Rakehell, I would needs be a Wit, My Friends soon perceived I
could not be a Divine; so they sent me to the Inns of Court, and there,
in faith, I peppered the Court with Libels and Lampoons: my Wit was so bitter, I
escaped the Pillory very narrowly, between you and I. But then, for good
Language, and strong Lines, none out did me


Why, thou were a most Plaguey Wit indeed!


Ay, Faith: and the Poets were so in awe of me! You must know, I was a devilish
biting Fellow: Why, we had a couple of your Poets here: Sir Humphrey, and I
made nothing of 'em, in faith


Gad take me, they were but silly Fellows: and yet, they say, they were Cock
Poets


That may very well be: we have Poets, as pretty Fops as any about Town; and
are fitter for Subjects of Comedies, than Authors of any thing


Sir, my Lord Bellamy is come to Town: and my Lady bid me tell you, she has
invited him to Dinner


Ha! my Lord come to Bury! Gad forgive me, what is the matter? ha?


What Is this? what, are we linked together?


Oh, you wag, you wag; this is Sir Humphrey! Ha, ha, ha. You Will never give over.


No, faith; not I.


Go home: I Will follow you.

Mr. Wildish, pray Honor my House at Dinner.


I will, my Lord Bellamy's my great Friend.


You shall have Sir Humphrey too; in faith, we will be merry, and turn the House
out of the VVindow


And I will Roar, Roar most exceedingly.


Your humble Servant.


Your Servant, Sir, we shall see you?


I will wait on you. Here, Roger my Gloves, Handkerchief, and my Sword. My dear
Bellamy in Town! This is a happiness I dreamed not of: I thought he had been
retired from the World, and would not come to so public a place. You Puppy,
these are your Wits, and fine Gentlemen, I have been Plagued with! A curse on
'em! What must I undergo, for the sake of my Love


I took 'em, Sir, and so do most here, for fine Gentlemen; but I wonder Mr.
Oldwit is so merry after his Disaster: And yet Sir Humphrey would make a Man
burst


What Disaster?


Why, Sir, his eldest Daughter, a great Fortune by her Mother, (his first
Wife; for he has had three) about four Months since, fled, the night before he
was to have Married her to a fine Bury Gentleman


I heard so; but she has sent a Letter, to let him know, that she will not be
forced to Marry: And for that end, she will not appear till the day after she is
at Age to dispose of her self; and that then she will; and is in the mean time
safe, beyond his enquiry


The young Daughter is a great Fortune by her Mother, who was an Heiress.


He has had a lucky hand at Heiresses: but I must find out my dear Bellamy.


My Kinswoman, who recommended thee, Charles, to my Service, told me, thou were
a Young Gentleman of the North, whom she knew and was of Kin too, and that thou
had left thy Guardian for harsh usage: And she engaged me to conceal and
protect thee


I can assure your Lordship, I have done nothing that can make you blush to own
me


I believe thee, my Kinswoman made me give my word to inquire no farther; and I
have kept it


You have, my good Lord.


I see thy Education has been good, and find thou art a virtuous Boy, and so
ready in thy Service; thy diligence has almost out flown my thoughts; yet it
has kept pace with my desires: and every thing thou do, thou seem to do
with pleasure


I should be wicked else, having so excellent a Lord and Master.


I use thee not as other Noblemen their Pages, who let Gentlemen's Sons ride at
the Tails of their Coaches, crowded with rascally Footmen: it is a French mode;
they used formerly to give 'em the same Education with their Sons, which made
their Fortunes; and 'twas a Preferment then, for a Gentleman's younger Son:
Now, they are bred to Box and Dice, and Cheat with the Footmen; after they are
out of Livery, perhaps they turn to the Recreation of the Highway; or the top
of their Fortune is to take up in some Troop, and there is an end of 'em


I must confess, your usage of me has been so Noble, that all the Service of my
Life, can never make return


Thou art too grateful. Thou Charm'st me too with thy pretty Voice: I Will breed
thee up to be my Friend. But, prithee, what is the reason that thou, who have
been ready to fly at my Command, have seemed to be uneasy, and unwilling, to
come to Bury


It Is the public time of the Fair, when Men of ^ll Countries flock hither;
and, as I told your Lordship, I was afraid of being discovered, and that my
Guardian would find me out, and seize me: and, Heaven knows, I had rather Dye,
than leave so good a Lord


Kindest of Youths, I love thee so, I will not part with thee, let who will
discover thee


My kind, good Lord, let me kiss your hands.


Besides, thou needst not be seen in the Fair; only I am to Dine at Mr.
Oldwit's to day


At Mr. Oldwit's! what do I hear?


Thou art my little Friend; I come to make love to his Daughter: She knows me
not; but I have seen her, and am extremely taken with her: the old man and I am
agreed. I must entertain her with some Music: I know thou wilt lend me thy Voice


Oh Heaven and Earth! what killing words are these! Ah me!


Why do thou sigh?


If your Lordship Marries, as no Lady sure can resist you, I shall be cast off.


Prithee think not so, dear Boy; thou art too secure of my kindness for that.


I never shall please your Lady. Besides, the Ladies never can endure their
Lords favorite Servants


I give thee my Hand, I Will never part with thee, till thou quittest me.


I Will quit my Life when I do that. Oh fatal hour, wherein I saw those Eyes! How
many years of Misery are like to hang upon it!


Ned, my dear Ned, welcome to my Arms! This is a happy Surprise.


My dear Bellamy! my dear Peer! I could not embrace a Mistress with more
Ardour! I thought you had been so retired, I had lost you


That was your fault: I have as pleasant a House and Seat, as most in England,
that is thine as much as mine, Ned


But it is in the Country; a pretty Habitation for Birds and Cattle: but Man is
a herded Animal, and made for Towns and Cities


So many Pens of Wild Beasts upon two Legs, undermining, lying in wait, preying
upon, informing against, and hanging one another: A Crowd of Fools, Knaves,
Whores, and Hypocrites


Hey, my Renegado Countryman: thou had once the Respect due to good Wine,
fine Women, Music, Wit and Sense, and true Pleasure


For good Wine; I coud never be Drunk, but I did some mad thing or other, which
made me ashamed to show my Face. For Women; those that were worth the having,
were hard to come by, and harder to put off; besides, the immorality of the
matter, gave me anxiety of Mind; I saw Men of Wit, when they came to
understanding, gave it over: and, when a thing must be done, it is best to do it
quickly


Thou may as well say, since we must dye, let us hang our selves now: No,
that is time enough, when we are weary of living. At our years, leave Women and
Conve^sation


He that Debauches private Women, is a Knave, and injures others: And he that
uses public ones, is a Fool, and hurts himself. And for Conversation, 'twas
all run into Parties and Politics, and become Dull and Dangerous: The Living
were such Knaves, I was resolved to Converse with the Dead, in my Study


But, in this late Scene of Action, the Knaves are pretty well laid open: and,
for all those Parties, we could meet with choice Company, truly honest, and
with whom good Wit and Sense was stirring, and would pass for current


Wit and Sense may pass in a Room with honest Fellows, but Noise, and Nonsense,
always carry it in the World


Pox on this dull Wisdom at our Age! it is as unseasonable as Snow in the
Dogdays. Can thou think, my dear Peer, that thy Philosophy can tame the
Vigor of my Appetites


I will no more suffer my Appetites to Master me, than Fire and Water* they
are good Ministers, while they can be kept under


I Would not give a Farthing for an Appetite that can be Curbed: My Stoic, I Would
have my Appetites high mettled, and run away with me


And I must always think a Man a Slave, till he has Conquered himself: for my
part, I had almost as leive be in subjection to another Appetites, as to my
own


This is Spleen, Wind in the Hypocondriacks pent: Why, thou will Prophecy at
least


Come, dear Ned, we'll debate this matter at more leisure: Time will make you
of my mind: for I observe, all men of Wit Reclaim; and only Coxcombs persevere
to the end of Debauchery. But prithee, what makes thee hereabouts? I Will lay my
Life, there is some Wench or other in the way


May be, that may be somewhat; but at present I come to ease my self from the
Swearing, Lying, Roaring, Vaporing, Cozening Noise and Tumult of New Market:
But I thought thou had renounced all Crowds, and should as soon have expected
a Hermit here


A little time may satisfy you I have reason.


Ha! Bell. what pretty Boy is this? ha!


He is a Gentleman's Son, he serves me at present. I Will tell the more enter
nous: But, in the mean time, he and my little Consort shall entertain you


This is somewhat.


I will not live like an ordinary Hunting, Hawking Puppy; I Will have my City
Pleasures in the Country: of which good Music being one; I Will spare some
Rogues, some Dogs, and Horses, to have that good


I have been visited this Morning, by three most confounded Fops, that ever
Plagued me yet; and they talked of nothing, but the Wit and Breeding of Bury:
Trim, Sir Humphrey Noddy, and Mr. Oldwit


There are those things in Bury, but as it is in Religion; least among those who
talk of them most, men are always proudest of their foibles, and keep their
Strength's concealed: If a fellow has but a difficulty of Speaking, or
Stutters, his Tongue will never lie still


A fellow that has one Leg shorter than another, will never stand still; but
Hop, hop, hop, round, round, round


Observe any Fellow that has a stinking Breath, as if a Voice were not intended
to be heard but smelt, will speak in your very Nose: and turn round as often as
you will, he turns with you, and your Nostrils must have it. Come begin


It Is very pretty; and delicately Sung.


Now I have got thee in the Country, I Will carry thee to my House, and make a
Convert of thee


Hey! La Roch, what makes you here?


Serviteur, Monsieur; my Lor, vot Serviteur: I see your Laquais below, dat make
me come up to kiss your hands


How now, Monsieur Cutbeard? what makes you at Bury-Fair?


Dis is de place dat is Fameux for de pretty Garl wid de cheveux blond, de
farie hair: my Man and I come for buy de vite lock, indeed to get de Monee
to make de Pot Boil, my Lor


A thought comes into my Head: It shall be so. I will have some Diversion,
while I am here


Dat be de last Peruke I send your Lorship? Begar, is fine Air, Curle
delicate morbleu: You talk of de Chedreux, he is no bodee to me; dear is no
man can Travaille vid me; Monsieur VVildish has got my Peruke on his Head:
let me see, here is de Hair, de Curle de bouckle, ver good, ver good. If dat
Fool Chedreux make de Peruke like me, I will be Hanga


Hold, good Monsieur Snip-snap, I have another Employment for you: Were you
ever here before


No.


That Is well. I must have you be a French Count. I remember we had a Count de
Brion at London, passed upon the choicest Sparks, and best Bred Men and Ladies:
I will have this Fellow pass upon the Fops of Bury, and amuse the wiser sort


You will never be without some mad Frolic, or other: But this, certainly must
be very pleasant


Of all female Creatures, my aversion is to the Lady Fantast, and her Affected,
Conceited, Disdainful Daughter: I will have this fellow personate a French
Count, and make Love to the Daughter


Ha, ha, ha, de French Count! dat be ver well: ha, ha! Make de Love! begar, I
come for make de Monee. Love! Morbleu, de French Count spend de Monee, de
French Peruke-maker make de French Count, he loosee de Monee


You shall lose no Money, you Puppy, my Man is acquainted with all this
Country, and shall help your Man to buy the Wenches Hair, the pretty'st Wenches
in England; and if you be a French Count, you shall have the Wenches too; all
the Town will run after you: you will be courted by every body, feasted, and
invited to Balls, and all Meetings; but the Lady Fantast, and her Daughter,
will be mad after you


Ha, ha, ha; de French Count, ver well indeed, ha, ha: I make de French Count:
begar, Monsieur, I have de Count of my Familee, I am a Gentilman of France.
Indeed my Parens did condiscent to let me make de Peruke, for I delighted in
it


Go you Rogue, you shall do this, I am resolved on it, or I Will cut your Throat.
You shall have Clothes and Ornaments of me, here are wholesale men; three or
four Suits for Footmen will do, and we'll help you to the men too. I Will bear
all the Charges; I Will do it, if it cost me a Hundred pound


Are you in earnest?


Ay, by Heaven, it shall be. You shall be called Monsieur le Count de Cheveux;
you shall be entertained like a Prince: the Women will lie with you, as if the
Devil were in them


Hah! dat be ver good indeed! I was not bred to make Peruke, it vas for my
diversion I did itte: I spent my time among de Gens de Quality in de Academy


Yes, to Shave them, thou true Picture of a French Scoundrel.


Dear I did appen to kille de Count for my Honneur.


Then there is a Count missing: you shall supply his place.


I flay, dey seize on my Land and my Chatteaux; and begar, it vas ver well for
me dat I did delight in make de Peruke ven I vas young indeed


This good Breeding of yours will qualify you excellently! Why, you will be
Adored by the Ladies: But, of all, I charge you to Court Mrs. Fantast; commend
her Wit and Breeding


Suppose she falls in love with him in earnest!


I Would give a hundred pound to see that. Well, Monsieur le Count, let us to my
Lodging, and fit you for this Enterprise


Hold, hold: if dey find me out, vil dey not wippe de French Count? Begar, I no
love to be wippe


Upon my Honor, I Will protect you.


Vel, vel; no more to be said: I am Monsieur le Count de Cheveux. Serviteur
Monsieur my Lor, vot tres humble Serviteur

Fala ha la.


Come, my Lord, your humble Servant, we are to meet at Dinner: I must about
this business, my Heart is set upon it; 'twill make an Admirable Farce


Get thee gone, Ned, thou art a mad Fellow: I Will go and take a little Air.


Allons Monsieur: Fa la la la la.
If my wise Conduct you please to rely on,
I Will make as good a Count, as Count de Brion.

WEll, I am weary of the Life I lead here; never poor Creature was so Teased,
as I am still, with my Stepmother, and her Daughter, the Old Cucko and the
Young, that tire me continually with the same Notes of Wit and Breeding: And
having themselves nothing but Folly and Affectation, are always reproaching me
for want of both


Madam, my Lady Madam Fantast, having attired her self in her morning
Habiliments, is Ambitious of the Honor of your Ladyship's company, to Survey
the Fair


Here Is a foul Copy of one of 'em: I see, this Folly is Contagious. Tell her,
I Will wait on her


She will suddenly arrive at this Place, where she desires the Interview may be
betwixt you


I will haste for my Hoods and Gloves, and the rest of my Movables; and be
here instantly


A fine young Lady this, if she had but half the Wit and Breeding of my Lady.

Madam, Mrs. Gatty will kiss your Ladyship's hands here incontinently.


Come, my sweet Daughter, consider what I have said. Thou art in thy maturity
of blooming Age; I have bred thee to the very Achme and Perfection of Bury
Breeding, which is inferior to none in this our Island; Dancing, Singing,
Ghittar, French Master: And I Will say that for thee, my Jewel, thou have
Sacrificed all thy Endeavors to attain thy Education; which, corroborated: by
thy Acuteness of Parts, have rendered thee exactly accomplished, and together
with the excellence of thy Beauty, justly admired by the Amorous Males, and
envied by the malicious Females


To all that, which the World calls Wit and Breeding, I have always had a
natural tendency, a penchen, derived, as the Learned say, Ex traduce, from your
Ladyship: Besides the great Prevalence of your Ladyship's most shining Example,
has perpetually Stimulated me, to the Sacrificing all my Endeavors toward the
attaining of those inestimable Jewels; than which, nothing in the Universe can
be so much a mon gre, as the French say. And for Beauty, Madam, the Stock I am
enriched with, comes by emanation from your Ladyship; who ha^ been long held a
Paragon of Perfection: most Charmant most Tuant


Ah, my dear Child: I! Alas, alas! Time has been, and yet I am not quite gone;
but thou have those Attractions, which I bewail the want of: Poetry, Latin, and
the French Tongue


I must confess, I have ever had a Tendress for the Muses, and have a due
reverence for Helicon, and Parnassus, and the Graces: But Heroic Numbers upon
Love and Honor, are most Ravissant, most Suprenant; and a Tragedy is so
Touchant! I dye at a Tragedy; I Will swear I do


I must confess, my dear, thy Wit has more of Notoriety, than thy Beauty; since
the pretty various Diversions of thy Pen, have transmitted thy Fame of Wit,
beyond the narrow limits of an Island. But it is now high time to manifest thy
Judgment, in the disposal of thy Person; and thou have rejected a Multitude of
Lovers


I am so much indebted to Nature and Education, that I am resolved not
unequally to dispose of that Person, which (without vanity I may say) Nature by
its genuine Bounty, and Art by its friendly Additions, have rendered not
disagreeable, or void of Attraits: But all want of Wit and Breeding, does
affect me with that unconquerable Chagrin, that, eh Good, I cannot suffer such
Fellows


Mine own dear Daughter, to a hair! And I must confess, we are troubled enough
with it in Mr. Oldwit, his Daughter, and his Companions: Had not my Jointure
been somewhat entangled, I had never had him. But Mr. Trim is as fine a
Gentleman, as the Sun in all his Circuit sees


Oh, my Eugenius! he is a finished piece of Humanity; but has not the Estate I
would have


Sir, Humphrey Noddy,


Has a very good Estate, but wants the Noble Accomplishments of my Eugenius,
whom I intend to preserve for my Platonic Servant. Gatty, I have some Minutes
impatiently expected your arrival, that I might do my self the great Honor to
kiss your Hands, and enjoy the favor of your Company into the Fair; which I
see, out of my Window, begins to fill apace


I got ready as soon as e're I could, and am now come to wait on you.


Oh, fie, Daughter! will you never attain, by mine, and my dear Daughters
Examples, to a more Polite way of Expression, and a Nicer form of Breeding?
Fie, fie, I come to wait on you! You should have said; I assure you, Madam, the
honor is all on my side, and I cannot be ambitious of a greater, than the
enjoyment of the sweet Society of so excellent a Person. This is Breeding


Ah, this had been a Propos: Observe my Lady.


Breeding! why, this had been a Flam, a mere Flam.


Eh, Mondieu! this had been delicate et bien tournee. Call generous
Complements, Flams


Thus you had s^own true breeding.


Breeding! I know no breeding necessary, but Discretion to distinguish Company
and Occasions, and Common Sense, to entertain Persons according to their Rank,
besides making a Courtesy not aukwardly, and walking with one's Toes out


Eh Good, eh Good.


Let me tell you, you are a pert young Thing: you are a Curious Judge indeed,
of the Art of refined Conversation


Art! Conversation ought to be free, easy, and natural.


Eh Good, eh Good: Sweet Madam, despise not Art. Can there be any Conversation
well dressed, as I may say, without French in the first place, to Lard it


Some Fops indeed think so, that use it in every Sentence.


Nothing is so Confident as Ignorance.


Ars non habet Inimicum praeter Ignorantem.


Look you there: I have bred my Daughter a Linguist.


A Lady may look after the affairs of a Family, the demeanor of her Servants,
take care of her Nursery, take all her Accounts every Week, obey her Husband,
and discharge all the Offices of a good Wife with her Native Tongue; and this
is all I desire to arrive at; and this is to be of some use in a Generation,
while your Fantastic Lady with all those Trappings and Ornaments you speak of,
is good for no more than a Dancing Mare, to be led about and shown


Eh, mon Dieu! pray forbear, sweet Madam, forbear; I am not able to hear this
Blasphemy against true breeding


It must needs be pretty French one learns of an Irishman at Bury. I believe
it is a kind of bastard French


Good Mrs. Gatty, you are very Confident.


Whatever you do, never speak against Art.


Art stiffens, and spoils Conversation, as Painting does Faces: if you hear
never so many florid Coxcombs, they speak all alike; and see never so many
painted Women, they look all alike


Eh, mon dieu! Quel fascheux; Ex quovis ligno, etc. Mercury's Statue is not
made of every Wood


Look you, I know your secret cogitations: Because you are so ill bred as to
look like a Tallow thing, and will not improve your Complexion by Art, you
obliquely reflect upon me and my Daughter, for our melioration of Nature


Come, come, Madam, if you be ready without a Complement, to go to the Fair, I
am ready to go with you; but, by my troth, if you look for Complements, you
must get them somewhere else. Come, I Will lead you


Ill breeding, au dernier point! Oh, my Chagrin. I kiss your Ladyships hands.


Oh, Mr. Oldwit, would you had been here, you would have heard a fine deal of
ill breeding from your Daughter Gatty


I was here at part of your discourse, and I heard nothing but good Sense from
her


Nay, she is like you.


Gad take me, I am glad she is not like you.


I know your ill breeding; but it is a shame you have not better cultivated your
Daughter as I have mine


Cultivate! A Pox on your affected stuff; should I have made her an affected
Ass, to be laughed at, as you and your Daughter are


Prodigy of Ignorance! my Daughter and I laughed at! Whom even the Court, when
we are there, perpetually Gaze at and Admire; and all the Beauties and Gallants
here make their Court to


A great many Flutterers do flock about you indeed, as small Birds would about
a Cast of Owls, to wonder at you


This is most Stupendous.


A Pox on this perpetual Noise about Wit and Breeding! You made my Daughter by
my first Wife run away, with Teazing her, and persuading me to be such an Ass
to press her to Marry one of your formal Fops, against her will, and now you
are plaguing this poor Girl, to make her runaway too, but I have agreed upon
Articles with one that will soon rid you of her


Most Exorbitant, and Amazing! 'Twere well, if beholding us could do any good
upon her


No doubt it will; as the sight of the Drunken Slaves did upon the Spartan
Children. There Is Wit, and Reading, for her


Were not we well fortified by Art and Nature, we might be obnoxious to the
taint of your and her most unsavory Rusticity. While all the Beau Mond, as my
Daughter says, are with us, in the Drawing Room, you have none but Ill-bred,
Witless Drunkards with you, in your Smoaking-room. What punishment do I
deserve, for making Alliance with so much Ill-breeding


What Plagues have I met with, in marrying an Affected Old Lady; who, with her
Daughter, take themselves to be Wits! Their Tongues never lie still: At
Dinner, they must have the whole discourse; at dinner the Common Crier, were he
there, could not be heard; no, not another Woman. There Is my Friend Iuvenal,
for you: Wit and Breeding


My Daughter and I no Wit, and you have it! this is most Astonishing! Ha, ha,
ha. If ever you had Wit, it is obliterated, antiquated, and buried in the
Grave of Oblivion


No Wit! Ounds, now you provoke me. Shall I, who was Jack Fletcher's Friend,
Ben Iohnson's Son, and afterward an Intimate Crony of Jack Cleaveland, and Tom
Randal, have kept Company with Wits, and been accounted a Wit these Fifty
Years, live to be Deposed by you


Ha, ha, ha.


Ha, ha, ha. I, that was a Judge at Blackfriers, writ before Fletcher's Works
and Cartwright's, taught even Tailor and the best of them to speak. I cannot go
to London yet, but the Wits get me amongst them, and the Players will get me
to Rehearsal to teach them, even the best of them: and you to say I have no
Wit, I say, you have not, nor ever had, any Beauty


Nay, now Mr. Oldwit, I can bear no longer. Shall I, that in my Youth Charmed
all the Gallants of that time, even to Fascination; and in my Widowhood, but
five years since, was Adored by Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and captivated
several of their Hearts, be thus Calumniated! Know, I have more Beauty than you
can make use of


Indeed, toward you, I am somewhat frigid; but some in the World know I have
a Colt's Tooth


I should serve you right, to have others find out my Colt's Tooth too, though
thou can not


Thy Tooth! the Devil of one thou have, but what came out of Bowlane: Three
remaining Stumps there are, that look like three broken Pillars in a ruined
Cloister. And there is Wit for you now, and a Clinch to boot


Poor Railing Buffoon! there Wit! Well, there are some of another mind,
concerning my Beauty


Pr'ythee take thy course with them: Whoever commits Adultery with thee, it
must be merely the Act of the Devil; there is nothing of the Flesh in it. What a
Pox, you and your Daughter are notorious, for out-painting all the Christian
Iezebels in England


It Is false, rude Fellow: we only use a Wash, and lay on a little Red.


No more does a Wall: but you, for your part, are fain to fill up the Chinks in
your rivell'd Skin, as House-painters do the Cracks in Wainscot, with Putty.
Pox on it, you would by Art appear a Beauty, and are by Nature a mere Mummy.
There Is Wit for you again. Gad, I Will pepper you with Wit


Did I not despise thee for thy want of Wit and Breeding, these barbarous
Contumelies would exhaust Tears from my Eyes


If thou should cry, it would make streaks down thy Face; as the Tears of the
Tankard do upon my fat Hosts Belly-pieces. There Is Wit again for you


Farewell Brute.


Fare thee well. He that would have the Devil more Damned, let him get him to
Marry a She Wit. Now, for the Fair. Here; who waits?


It Is pleasant to observe the mixture of People here*


Ah, how pleasant 'twoud be, if none but the Beau monde made their promenade
here! but I hate the Canaille


What do you lack, Ladies? fine Mazarine Hoods, Fontanges, Girdles, Sable
Tippets, choice of fine Gloves and Ribbands


Stockins, Silk Stockins; choice of Silk Stockins: very fine Silk Stockins.


All sorts of Essences, Perfumes, Pulvilio's, Sweet-bags, Perfumed Boxes for
your Hoods and Gloves, all sorts of sweets for your Linen, Portugal sweets to
burn in your Chamber. What do you lack? What do you buy


I have no such contempt for the common People: they come near Nature, and have
no Art or Affectation; and there are a thousand Fops made by Art, for one Fool
by Nature


Oh fie! Odi profanum vulgus, etc.


Fine morning Gowns, very rich Indian stuffs; choice of fine Atlasses; fine
morning Gowns


Will you please to Raffle for a Tea-pot, a pair of Candlesticks, a couple of
Sconces


Not all the Clouds assembled in the Firmament, can hide, or can eclipse so
muffle the Sun, but we poor Mortals know it shines, and feel the warm effects.
Why should Dorinda think to blunt her pointed Glories, or conceal the Radiant
Luster of her conquering Beams


I see, to the quick-sighted Eugenius, nothing is obscure. Nor coud Eugenius in
the Dark be hid: that golden Tongue, and that sweet Eloquence would soon reveal
him; as the Proscribed Senator was by his Perfumes betrayed


How does the bright Dorinda make me blush, when she commends my Eloquence; and
in that very Act so much exceeds me


Fine! very fine! bien turn! that thought's very recherchee. Observe, Madam:
this is a true Witty and well-bred Gentleman


Now really, Madam, between you and me, this man appears to me a most
extraordinary Shallow Coxcomb, as one can possibly see in a Summer's day


Eh Good, eh Good! poor Soul, I pity thee: but, assurement, nothing can be more
engaging than the Wit and Breeding of Eugenius


I see, there is no contending with Dorinda: she will have the Ascendant over
poor Eugenius; his small Pinnace must strike Sail to her Admiral. Wit


These Fops are very happy: for if an Archangel should tell 'em they were Fops,
they would not believe it


Let me present to the fair Dorinda's hands a little offspring of my Brain* the
Tribute of my Morning Service


I was just going to present Eugenius with the Issue of my teeming Muse, who
was delivered this morning of a Pastoral: I must needs say, she had a good
time, for she had an easy Labor; Aurora Musis amica. But pray let me read
yours first


Oh, Madam, does your Ladyship hear the News?


What News; Luce?


Oh, Madam, such news, as perhaps may not be ungrateful to your Ladyships Ears.
There is now, even now arrived a Noble French Count; the finest Person my eyes
yet ever beheld: I saw him, heard him speak; he speaks English. He has the
prettiest Charming way! no Lady sure can e're resist him


Who can this be?


Ha! a French Count? Oh Lord! I am afraid I am not in Order enough: he will
certainly make addresses to me; how is my dress


Very French, and very exact.


The report of me has certainly brought him hither. Heaven a French Count, say
you! Now we shall see Breeding in Perfection: and I am glad I shall have the
opportunity of appearing before so great a Judge


How do you know but this French Count may be an errant Coxcomb?


Oh, Madam, Madam, I beseech you betray not your ill Breeding. A French Count a
Coxcomb! Mon dieu


It is not, my Dorinda --


When shall our Eyes be blessed with the sight? when, think thou, will he make
this place happy


My Eyes saluted him first upon the Change: his Landlord, who was with him,
told me what he was; from thence I followed him to Cook-row, and so through the
Fair to the Bowling-green* His Air, his Mien, and his Deportment charmed me so,
I coud not leave him: there I saw him ride the Flying Horse, with his Equipage,
which much delighted him


Shall we go to the Bowling-green? My expectation is on Tiptoes, till I behold
him


That Is a rare saying! I Will remember that. My expectation is on Tiptoes! Madam,
he is gone from thence, and said he would be in the Fair presently


This sudden indifference toward me seems abrupt and temerarious!


Fine mellow Pears; fine Burgamy Pears; fine Norwich Pears.


Fine Ginger-bread: very good Ginger-bread.


Yonder Is my Mistress; I know her, for all her Mask: I Will present her with a
Fairing


Madam, it is not a Mask can conceal you from a Lover; whether I see you or no,
my Heart will leap up to my Teeth when ever you come in presence; as a dead
Body will bleed at the arrival of the Murderer. Is not that well said, Mr.
Trim


'Sdeath, my Shins!


Men's Hearts seldom come so near their Mouths.


Madam, let me present you with your first Fairing, a Heart.


Of Ginger-bread.


Ay faith, pretty Lady.


Is it a true Image of your own? Did you sit for it?


Ha, ha, ha; a very good Jest! Udsbud, there is a pair of Gloves of the same
mettle, to stop your pretty Mouth. And, Mr. Trim, here is a Wise Cap, befitting
your Gravity, and the Solidity of your Parts, for you


Sir, there is an old Adge, that says, Familiarity breeds Contempt: I am past
those Juvenile Joques


Alas, poor old Gentleman! Come, Madam, walk, and let us see the diversions of
the Fair: I warrant you, I Will make you merry


Oh, this Count! Did you see the Count?


No; but I hear there is a flaming French Beau come to Town: Will your Lordship
Raffle a bout or two


The activity of this Monky is as ridiculous as the Gravity of that Paboon.
Wildish here! Down, down my Heart: Thou foolish Heart; why do thou flutter
so? I see he is thus far a Man of Honor: If all he says, in his Letters, were
as true! And yet I know not whether I should wish it


Oh, Madam, here is the rarest News! Have you heard of the French Count?


Ay, my Dear; and therefore am come to bless my Eyes. His Fame is diffused
throughout the Town: they say, he is the finest Gentleman that ever came to
Bury


Good! It takes as I could wish.


How now, Sir, who are you?


One who has lost a Heart, and apprehends you for it.


You are somewhat free of Carriage.


Think not, my pretty Mad-cap, that a piece of Velvet can conceal you: Your
Eyes strike at every one you level at, like Lightning through a Cloud


Very pretty! Shall I oblige Mr. Trim with this fine expression? he will give you
any Money for it


Sir, --


Now is this Fop setting out his Bum for a smart bout at Complement.


It is so great an Honor to our Town --


Sir, your most humble Servant.


Is this his Breeding? Indeed, when I left him, he led me not to the door of
his Lodging


Oh, mon Dieu! here is that London Wit, that is a Laugher, and Scoffer! I hear
he has made a Lampoon upon Bury. I hate the Fellow


He a Wit! Mr. Trim or Sir Humphrey, would make nothing of him.


Look you, my dear Mad-cap, I must love you, and will love you; say what you
can, do what you can, I will always haunt you while I am alive, and never leave
you when I am dead


Nay hold, good Mr. Hothead, I doubt not but our Lives will differ so, that we
shall part when we are dead, Sir, whatever we do living: And a sure way to part
while we are alive, would be to Marry, which Heaven forbid; then it would
certainly follow to some purpose


The Steel shall sooner willingly desert the Loadstone, than I my pretty Miss.


You are not sure in Earnest


By Heaven, and all the Powers --


I mind Vows in Love, no more than Oaths in Anger. That I were sure once that
you were in love with me


There is nothing to prove it to you, which I will not undertake.


Your Hand upon it.


My Heart upon it; which here I present you.


Now have I one to Domineer over. Tremble; for I will make thee such an
Example, as shall be a Terror to thy Sex, and revenge all the Insolences
committed upon mine


I am prepared for all thy Tyranny, good Semiramis.


I will make thee fetch and carry, and come at my foot, like a Spaniel.


And I will persevere so, I Will make thee relent, tho thou were a Devil.


Come, Gentlemen and Ladies, come down Guinea's apiece, and Raffle for a
Tea-pot: Come, Jack Trim, Jack; Mr. Wildish, Ladies


Jack! Jack! ill Bred. For Complaisance and Breeding sake, I Will do it. Bellamy!
My Lord, I can assure your Lordship, there is not a Person among the race of
Mankind --


Sir, I am your humble Servant. My dear Ned! I see, here is all the good
Company


My dear Lord, I am glad you are come: here is the best Company in Bury.


It Is a delicate Morning: I have been sucking in the sweetest Air in England.


My noble Lord, your most humble Servant. It Is indeed very fine Weather; it
used to be Bury-foul, instead of Bury-fair. Is not that a pretty Clinch, Jack


Sir, let me tell you, there is a Spanish Proverb, which says, Whego de manos,
whego de Villanos


Do you call me Villain in Spanish? I shall reckon with you for that.


I Will put in for a Rafflle with these Ladies. Come, Madam, will you Raffle for
a Heart


No, my Lord: that is usually a light, hollow thing, and not Sterling neither;
I am for massy Plate, that will endure the touch


Mine will endure the strictest touch. If your Beauty be equal to your Shape
and Wit, you Conquer all you look on


What do I see! that is my Sister! He is already fixed upon my Ruin, my Death.
Sister, I never till now could wish thy Beauty less. If not discovered, I am at
least undone


Come, Charles, thou shall Raffle too: Here Is a Guinea for him.


My Lord, your Lordships most humble Servant.


Sir, I kiss your Hands.


What a Pox, is this Puss my Wife here? I Will lay my Life she hears of the
French Count: I was in hopes she would have been sullen, and we might have had
the House to our selves. Come, come, off with your foolish Masks: My Lord, this
is my Wife


And this is my Daughter.


I dare swear she is.


Mr. Wildish!
This, my Lord, is my Daughter.

Madam, your Father has commanded me to do my self the honor of the World I
am most ambitious of


You are resolved, my Lord, your Ambition shall be no danger to the Government.


I own no Government, but yours: Others, but rule the Body; you, the Mind.


How can I hear my own sad Funeral Peal?


Mr. Wildish, my Daughter.


So, Madam, you have my Heart; it is flown, I could not hold it: look to it, and
make much on it, and see that it comes to no Damage; I shall require it whole,
and safe


It Is a light one, and always ready to whistle off at any Game; and as ready to
be lured back again: but, if I have it, I Will use it so, it shall be glad to be
gone


That Beauty cannot harbor so much Cruelty. Oh, that this Kiss would last to
Eternity


Raptures are no more signs of Love, than Huffing is of Courage.


Oh, you Arch Wag you! are you there?


Yes, that I am. Ha, ha, ha. Come, down with your Guinea. Now we have enough
for a Tea-Pot, and a pair of Sconces


She Is delicately handsome as an Angel! what think thou, my Boy?


With Submission, my good Lord, I think she is mortal; I am not surpised with
her Beauty. Look narrowly; does she not look like a Shrew


No; she is all sweetness in perfection!


I wish you find her not so: Fame whispers


Daughter, Daughter; yonder comes the French Count! It must be he.


Mon Dieu, it is he! Nay, if Quality or Breeding scapes my Eye, I have lost my
Cunning. What an Air? what a Mien is there


Nicholas.


Monsieur?


Take de notice of dose two Garle, vatch them, dey have de very fine Air.


His Person is Charmant, Tuant his Air, victorious his Mien: Mon pauvre Coeur!


I could not wish better success.


A most Charmant, Tuant Mien, in eating Burgamies: he out-craunches a
Schoolboy on a Holy Day. I Will lay my life, he is an errant Coxcomb


Page, set my Cravat-string. Ver well, ver well.


He is an incomparable Person!


Thy Farce is like to take admirably: the Rogue looks very stately, and
Fantastical


No Gudgeons ever took their Baits more greedily.


Monsieur, Serviter tres humble. Have you forgotte me?


Monsieur le Count de Cheveux!


De same* I had de Honeur to wait upon you vid my Regiment of Gen d' Arms, on
de right Attaque at Luxemburgh. Oh, my Lor Bellamy, I am surprise ver much! you
did Charge my Regiment at de Battle of Monts. I will say no more of dat; but,
Begar, you did make us turn de Back; vich de Regiment never did before, nor
since; But is all one for dat, Serviteur tres humble


The Rogue Acts it admirably!


You are welcome into England.


I come to see de fine Lady, de grand Beautee English; which, Begar, is beyond
all de Varle: yes indeed


You have learnt the Language?


I speak a littel. I did keep de Company vid de English Officeers; de ver
brave Gentleman indeed, to learn de Langage; for I did resolve to come di^
plas, for see de Beautee and de Wit of England


Perhaps, your most auspicious Stars could not have guided your wandering course
to a more proper Region of the Earth, than this little City of Bury, for the
full Satisfaction of both these Curiosities you are pleased to mention: nor is
in all the Regions of Earth you have Surveyed, a Person more devoted to your
Service, than your most humble Servant John Trim


Monsieur Iean Trim, you do me de grand Honeur; Begar, me am your humble
Serviteur. Jerny bleau, dis fellow be one great Fool indeed.


That is the Lady and Daughter I told you of: this is the Lady's Husband.


Is ver well: let me alone for dat.


A most admirable Person of a Man! his Eyes brillant, and fierre! my Heart is
gone: he may say, as Caesar did, Veni, vidi, vici


My Eyes never beheld a Parallel.


Eh Good! how the French Nobless outshines our's! methinks, they look like
Tailors to 'em


Monsieur, your most humble Servant: welcome to Bury as I may say.


My Lord Count, you are heartily welcome to Bury: and I beg the honor of your
Company at Dinner, at my House


Monsieurs, me kis^e your hands: me did tinke to invite de Shief Majistrat, I
don know vat you call him, Oh, is Alderman, to take de Collation vid me; butte
me can no refuse de faveur


I am transported with Joy!


Daughter, speak to him in French; he seems already Captivated with your Looks.


You are appy in de Conversation of de very fine Ladee; butte to let you know
my Skill, my Cunning, me vil gage a hundred Pistol, dat dat fine Ladee, and her
ver pretty Sister, are de French Ladee


Ounds, this Count will make my damned affected Toad so proud, the Devil would
not live with her. French, and Sister, with a Pox


We have often bewailed the not having had the honor to be born French.


Pardon me; is impossible.


Monfoy, je parle vray: we are mere English assurement.


Mon foy, je parle vray! vat is dat Gibberish? Oh, let me see; de Fader is de
Lawyere, an she learn of him at de Temple: is de Law French. I am amaze!
French Look, French Air, French mien, French movement of de Bodee! Morbleau.
Monsieur, I will gage 4, 500 Pistol, dat dese two Sister vere bred in France,
yes. Test bleau, I can no be deceive


Iee vous en pry, do not; we never had the blessing to be in France; you do us
too much honor. Alas, we are forced to be content with plain English Breeding:
you will bring all my blood into a blush. I had indeed a penchen always to
French


Penchen! vat is dat? Oh, is Law French. You put de very great Confusion upon
me: I tought it was impossible to find dat Mien, Air, Wit, an Breeding, out of
France


French! why, my Lord Count, this is my Wife, this is her Daughter.


Daughtere! dis young Ladee have de Daughtere! Begar, you make my Head turn
round, an mine Hair stand up: is impossible. Pardon me


My dear sweet Lord Count, you pose me now with your grand Civilities: She is
my Daughter; I was Married indeed exceeding young


Pegar, Madam, den you be de pretty Modere, she de pretty Daughtere, in de
whole Varle. Oh mine Art, mine Art! dose Eyes, dat Air, ave kille me! I
brought de Art out of France, and I ave lost it in dis plas: is gone, Madam;
an Morbleau, you see now de French Count vidout a Heart


With what frigidity she looks on me! and with what warm Transport she seems to
pierce the Frenchman through! Varium and mutabile semper foemina


What would you give for such a Servant?


Just as much as I would for you: I had not so much as pitched upon a Country
yet for my choice; but methinks France should be the last. I like not these
Apish Counts; they are mere Kickshaws


You judge right, Madam, of this Count at least.


Indeed, he seems to me a very choice Coxcomb.


Oh, Madam, you have de fine Hair, de very fine Hair! dose tresses Conquer de
Lovere; Cupid make his Net of dat Hair, to catch de Art: de coleur delicat,
better den my Peruke is great deal: Begar, if I had dat Hair, I would make two
tree Peruke of dat


Pox on you, you Rascal. You are no Barber, Sir; yoe are a Count.


Have de Patiance: dat is, me could make de Peruke two tree; butte I voud make
de Locket, de Bracelet, an de pretty Love knack


A very good Monster! a very pretty delicate Monster: the like never seen in
England! The Monster is just now beginning


Pimper le Pimp, the High German Juggler! pray walk in, and take your places;
it is the last time of Showing this morning


Vat is Pimp? Vat, does he let a de Whore at de Fair?


A most delicious dainty monster, the most delightful monster, the prettiest
monster ever was seen! The most admirable! The most incomparable monster


Ha, ha, ha. Begar, I like dis Iean Pudding very well; I will talk vid him,
Begar: he make me Laugh dis morning, he almost kille me


You Rogue, remember you are a Count, and no Barber, Puppy.


You see his Wit and Judgment! he finds out good Breeding immediately!


Yes, he has found Wit in a Jack Pudding.


Morbleau, Madam, I have see de Marionette de Iean Pudding in France* dat have
de great deal of Esprits, and of de Wit: de very pretty man, and de very good
Company; yes indeed


No doubt, Sir, Assurement ouy. Look you, Mrs. Gatty.


Begar, dat be very merry Gentilman; English!


Death, let us in, and Rescue him.


Sir Humphrey, you have suffered for your Wit I see.


Only a Head broken, that is all: the inside of your Head will often endanger
the outside, Sir Humphrey


Pish, this is nothing. Pox on it, an accident; a mere Accident Gad take me,
I Will have my Jest, let what will come on it


Insolent Peasan! Begar, me vill kille two tree tousand Peasant. Strike de
Gentilman! Sire morbleau, me vill help you to kille de damn Peasant


Come, come to my House: my Daughters Woman shall lay you on a Plaster.


I voud be glad to put my Cutto into de Body of de Peasant, dey have fright
de Lady


But, Monsieur le Count, our Peasants have Quarter-staves; and if Gentlemen go
to run 'em through, they will knock 'em down: and we commend 'em for it


De Peasant! begar, de Peasant be de Slave, de Dog, morbleu.


Our Peasants wear Shoes and Stockins, and lie warm; and have good Meat and
Drink in their Houses


Your King is a King of Dogs then: but how much greater is ours, who is a King
of Men, and Free Men! Ours Governs the willing, he the unwilling


Your King great as our King! Jerny, your King can do noting, dear is de Law,
de Parliament, I don know vat begar: my King can send for my Head wen he pleas;
yes indeed, hum


My Lord Count, it is almost Dinner time.


The Rogue talks, as if he were of the Blood Royal.


Yes, like the next Successor.


Yes, Begar, he can send for my Head: and dat be very good for him.


But my King cannot send for my Head when he please.


Morbleu, dat be very good for you: yes indeed.


COme my Lord Count, my Lord Bellamy, and Gentlemen, may good Digestion wait on
Appetite, and Health on both; as Mackbeth says: Ah, I love those old Wits


You are a Wit in your Heart.


Ay, faith, so I am; and I love to be merry at Meals. Ah, Wit is as necessary
as good Wine at Table


Ay, faith, so it is: I summon up all my Wit at Dinner.


My Lords, and Gentlemen, we'll into my Smoaking-room, and sport about a
Brimmer; and Wit shall fly about like Hail-shot. Oh, the Wit that I have heard
in that Room


We will wait on you soon; but I have promised the Ladies an Entertainment,
with a little Concert of Music by my own Servants, who are ready now: and I
desire you will call the Ladies, Sir


If your Lordship please: but, faith, we had better be a Toping.


Did you ever hear the Thetford Music?


Not I, Sir.


'Sbud, they are the best Music in England: there is the best Shawm and
Bandore, and a Fellow that Acts Tom of Bet'lem to a Miracle! and they ^ing
Charon, Oh gentle Charon, and Come my Daphne, better than Singleton and Clayton
did


Her^'s the pleasure of Country Conversation, Bellamy: Had not a man better be
condemned to the Galleys, than endure it


I am of your Opinion, Ned; and for that Reason, never have such Company at my
House: If I have, it is but for once; for Country Gentlemen, unless you repay
their Visit, are too proud to see you twice: and I never Visit any, but such as
I like very well


Morbleu, vat is dat? Monsieur Wildish, did you hi^e me?


Not I, Monsieur.


Nor you, my Lore?


Not I, Monsieur le Count.


Ventre bleu, is dear again! Sire, vat you mean by dat, to strike me between de
Head and de Shouldere


My Lord, if your Honor had given your self the leisure circumspectly to have
made Inquisition into any part of the History of my Life and Breeding, or into
the sedate Composure and Serenity of Mind, you might easily have Collected that
I am a Person that either never exercised my self in such Juvenile and Jocular
Diversions; or, at least, have totally abandoned them


Begar, dis be de very great Fop, Test bleu, I no understanda him. Again? is de
Diable. Ah, may foy, is dat merry Gentilman.


Nothing, nothing at all, my Lord Count, among Friends: I cannot forbear my
Jest, in faith; let us Kiss, and be better acquainted


Vid all mine Art.


Sirrah, Rogue, remember you are a Count still.


Is all one: I sometime take delight to Shave de Nobless of France, for my
plaisir


Now, my Lord, let the Music strike up; here are the Women: I long to be at
Brimmers


Now for ^ fit of Mirth.


Come Charles, begin.


It Is admirable! the Court has no better.


You must be putting in, with your ill Breeding! If any Traveller* should
affirm that Italy afforded better, I should humbly demand his Pardon


I am swallowed up in Admiration! je suis astonne! I am only in doubt, whether
the Harmonious Composition, or the elegant Performance, be most Charmant


Dat is admirable bien dict, Madam!


I had a Daughter that sung -- But, no more of her.


What do I hear? I Will haste away: Farewell.


I never heard a Voice and Manner so like my poor Sister's. I thought he had
some resemblance of her, but that he is of another Complexion: But he was so
Bashful, he would not show his Face


My Lord, can they sing Lilly Burlero? or have they e're a merry Song?


My Servants are no Fiddlers.


Come, come, my Lords and Gentlemen, into my Smoking Room: Women, go pack into
the Drawing Room, and play at Toe Gleek, or Ombre; go


Oh, Madam, get the French Count with us, or I am Ruined. Oh, he is the finest
Personage, and most agreeable


Good Mr. Oldwit, you will betray your ill Breeding: Entertain one of the
French Nobless with Smoking and Sotting! he shall with us. You show your Wit,
and not a word of French among you


'Sdeath, my Wit! dare you profane my Wit? Thou old, ill-bred, silly Creature,
I Will teach thee better Breeding, and make thee submit to thy Lord and Master


Sir* I beg your pardon; I am for de Ladee: I no Drink, I no Smoke. Come,
Madam, vee vill play at de petites jeux, or some ting or oder. Begar, de smoke
spoil my orangery and Pulvilio


Oh, I love de Petites jeux extremement.


I am also for the Ladies; to whom I have ever Sacrificed all my devoir: Madam,
I kiss your hands


Pish! But as I was saying, Monsieur --


Ha! must I be Sacrificed to that Kickshaw of a Frenchman? It shall not be long
e're he receive a Chartel from me


Mr. Oldwit is so importunate, that I cannot leave him yet, in faith; But I Will
steal away, and pay my Duty to you


No, no, Sir Humphrey, no matter: the Count is an Accomplished Gentleman.
Monsieur, you were speaking --


Say you so, Ud'sbud? the Count my Rival! I will take an occasion to kick that
damned Count most exceedingly


Daughter, meet me half an hour hence, without fail, in the great Dining Room
above


I will, Sir.


Pray let it be within a quarter of an hour, for most important Reasons I will
give you there


I have contrived an opportunity for your Lordship to be private with your
Mistress, my Lord


You infinitely oblige me, Sir.


Come, now let us all into my Smoaking-room. Go, Womankind, pack away to your
Cards, and your Tea


Mr. Oldwit, I humbly take my leave, to withdraw with the Ladies.


No, faith, shall you not. Sir Humphrey, take him you by one Arm, and I Will take
him by the other


Gentlemen, Gentlemen, commit not a Rape upon me, I beseech you: I drink not
between Meals. Did you know how averse I am -- Sir, Sir, I would not be
Intoxicated for the Universe: Sir, Sir


Come, my Lord, and Mr. Wildish.


We wait on you.


What are we Condemned to?


Here, where is this damned Butler? bring the Monteith, and Bottles. Well, Mr.
VVildish, you are one of the top London Wits


Not guilty, upon my Honor.


No matter for that. But did you ever hear more Wit fly about a Dinner at
London? Such Broadsides and such Merriment, my Lord


Yes, indeed, a great deal of Wit did fly about the Room.


Sir, your humble Servant. When my Lady asked me for a piece of Rabbet, you
remember I told her it was a Rawbit, for 'twas not roasted; ha, ha, ha


That was a good jest indeed.


She asked me, if I would have any Custard? I told her, I was not such a Fool to
refuse it


And, when she asked me, Will you have any Woodcock, Husband, I answered No: I
will have some Goose, Wife. She thought to have put the Woodcock upon me; and I
put the Goose upon her, in faith


Ha, ha: Very good! excellent!


These Gentlemen, Mr Wildish, are Witty, I must confess they want not Salt, and
are indeed very Jocose; but I would gladly hear something from your self, and my
Lords Honor, that savours more of Solidity, than what they hitherto have
produced


Are you always thus Witty, Sir Humphrey?


Oh, ay. The Judges, when they come the Circuit, certainly send for me: they
love my Company


Do Judges love this way of Wit?


Ever while you live; and your Sergeants, and Doctors of Divinity: the last
time I Dined in such company, I told a Story of a Doctor of Divinity, whose
Wife used to entertain him with three Dishes every day; Bitter, Pout, and Tart.
There was such a Laughing, they Roared out again: The Ladies Tyhee'd under
their Napkins; I am the Son of a Whore, if the Tyhee did not take a reverend
old Gentlewoman as she was a Drinking, and she squirted out the Beer out of her
Nose, as an Indian does Tobacco. Ha, ha, ha


Pr'ythee, dear Sir Humphrey, forbear; I am not able to bear it: I have laughed
my self sore. Mr. Trim, what ails you? you are melancholy


I must confess, Sir Humphrey is a man of neat concise parts, and exceeding
Jocular; but my way is to affect, being more grave and solid


Grave and solid! Come, come, you want a Bottle. Why, Sirrah, Butler, come
quickly. You shall have a whisking Bumper


Sir, I protest against Bumpers: I would not drink a Bumper for the Universe.


Rascal, make haste, you lazy Elephant* and, do you hear, bring me my Horn I use
to Drench the Restive Drinkers with. I Will make you take your Dose


That men should cloud the Faculties of their noble Souls, and put their minds,
as 'twere, into a Mist


VVy, you can make a Joque, Sir Humphrey upon any thing.


I seldom fail, thank God.


Let Us hear now, upon the VVainscot.


Pshaw waw! it is weak Wainscot.


How so? it is good Danish Oak.


Ha, ha, ha; you know, the weakest goes to the Wall: the VVainscot goes to the
Wall; Ergo, weak VVainscot. Ha, ha


Ha, ha, ha: passing good!


I am ready again: Reprieving VVainscot.


How so? the Devil cannot find that out.


Ha, ha, ha: why, Wainscot saves many a Hanging:


Ha, ha: admirable! for, if I had not. VVainscoted my Rooms, I must have had
Hangings. He Will kill me some time or other


Upon the Window.


Why it is a damned mutinous Window; for it is full of Quarrels: You shall never
take me at a Why not


Upon the Looking-glass.


Why, it is an Ill-natured Looking-glass.


How so?


Because it makes Reflections; ha, ha.


Upon the day.


Upon the day. Hah, hum; why, it is a scabby day.


A scabby day?


Ay, because the Sun's broken out.


For the love of Heaven, dear Friend, not so fast: I cannot suffer it. Come,
Sirrah, a Bumper


Sir, there are four Gentlemen come to wait on you.


Who? Butler, remove the things into my Parlour: this Room's


Sir, you have Company enough, I beseech you, Sir: Sir, I disclaim Drink
between Meals


VVildish is not here yet; I am come somewhat before my time, to fly from the
horrible Impertinence in the Drawing Room. I Will lay my life, this French Count
is some idle Scoundrel, and an Impostor


Madam, your most humble Servant: you have not stayed long, I hope.


Not at all for you, I assure you, Sir: my Father appointed me --


Not this quarters hour yet, by my Watch.


It wants nothing by mine: but you Sparks have such vanity, that you are ready
to turn every thing to your own advantage. Can you believe I come to meet you
here


Is it not fitter for your Youth and Beauty, to meet an honest young Fellow,
who is in Love with you to Madness, than an Old Fellow with musty Sayings, old
Proverbs, and wise Counsel


Don't abuse my Father behind his back. He wise! No wiser than your self: He is
a Bury Wit, as you are a London one


I a Wit, Madam? You are resolved to use your Sovereign Power over me; and I Will
show you my Passive Obedience. Do you Swagger like a Tyrant? you shall find I
can bear like a Slave


Yes, you can act a Slave for a time, in hopes of making me one ever after.


Ah, Madam, those eyes were made to Conquer, and preserve their Conquests:
where e're they come, they will Govern always


For all that, if I were Married to you, which Heaven avert, you would, within
three months, be apt to think my Maids eyes, though a Doudy, more Victorious


It is impossible: I could as soon prefer a farthing Candle to the Sun.


Nay, I shall never try.


I am resolved I Will never leave you: I will wait upon your Person, or watch
about your House continually


But I Will command you from me; I Will try my Dominion.


In what ever I can, I will obey you: but you may as well command your Shadow
from you, in the Sunshine


I Will call in aid, to remove you farther.


Not Bombs, or Cannons, can do that. While you are awake, I Will never be from
you; and when you sleep, I Will watch, and sigh, and sing my Plaints about your
House


Sure you dare not be thus bold!


By Heaven, I cannot help it: and look to it; for this in Bury (as all little
Towns are full of Tatling and Censure) will bring Scandal to you, at least, if
it does not produce Love in you


For Love, I am sure it shall not: and for Scandal, I Will remove.


Where ever you go, you have fast hold on my Heart Strings, and will tug me
along with you


If I have, I Will tug you, I Will warrant you, till I crack them. These are Flams:
I Will to London; there I shall be lost to you, like a Hare in a Hare Warren, and
you shall yelp no more after me


You are so fair, so bright, above all others, that I shall follow you by your
Track of Light, and never miss you


Are there any Lovers thus Impudent, to think to procure Love by troubling one.


Is it Impudence, to own your Power, and my Weakness? In short, Madam, I am
resolved to haunt you worse than any Beau, and pelt you with Billets doux some
Fifteen times a day


What, like one of those odious Creatures, will you Dress at me? and tie
Cravats at me? and strut like a Turky-cock, and prune your self


Even so; and stare, and goggle at you; and never have my Eyes off you, while I
Side-box you in the Playhouse


What, where the Beaux draw up three Ranks deep every day?


Yes.


Well, and I Will never cast my Eyes upon you for a whole Play together.


That will be over acted; and cunning Intriguers will Censure you from that.


Very fine! But I assure you, if you join with the Beaux, you shall never be
looked upon by me: for there is not upon Earth a more odious sight, than those
Boxes full of ugly Beaux. I observe, the Beaux now are the ugliest
Hatchet-fac'd Fellows about Town


Fellows of five and fifty, with grizly Beards, set up for Beaux: and among
these will I herd, when you are at a Play, that I may Ogle you, Fair


Then will I leave the Play.


So will I.


And to the Park.


So will I: where I will Side-glass you, turn when you turn, --


Then will I leave the Park.


So will I, and follow you to the Mall.


You will not dare sure?


Yes I will: and strut up to you, with a Slur and a Coupee; sing a silly new
Song or two softly in your Ear, and put on an Air of Gayety, as if I had
succceeded


I Will soon shake you off, and go to the Drawing Room.


No sooner there, but I am with you: and it is as good a Scene of Ogling, as any.


Sure, I shall cast you off when I go to Church.


The Beaux are the most constant Churchmen: you shall see Troops of 'em pork'd
up in Galleries, setting their Cravats. There you shall be sure to find me: and
I will stare you out of your Prayers. In short, my dear, sweet, pretty Madcap,
I am resolved never to give thee over, while I have breath


This is most amazing! Art not thou a very Impudent Fellow, to talk thus? Do
you call this making Love? why, this is making War; worse than Blockades and
Sieges, which they write of in Gazettes


It is a gentle Siege; but I will never raise it. I may fall dead before your
Fort


And that you shall, before you take it.
What a dissembling Jade am I now

Then will I haunt you at noon, at dead of night --

You will come a faithful Humble Be, and Hum, and Buz; as the Rehearsal says.


Oh, my Lord, I have had the Advantage of you, in stealing from you confounded
Company before you


You have so; but there is great enquiry made after you.


We were bad enough with our Punning Fools; but that new Detachment of
Drunkards and Visitants, made 'em completely the most confounded Company I ever
was condemned to. Here are the fruits of the Country! Prithee, my Dear Peer,
fling off this melancholy thought of Retirement, and let us enjoy thee again in
London: let me not lose my dearest Friend, for a Fit of the Spleen, or two


Dear Ned, if any thing could tempt me to that noisie Town, thou, and some
choice Friends, whose Conversation I extremely value, might do it: but I am
weary of it, and dote upon my quiet Retirement


Man is not self-sufficient: he was made a Sociable Animal, and must have
Conversation


And that, by a Man of a good Estate, as you and I have, may be had in the
Country


Merry Meetings may be had; but not so frequently, as your Sessions: and when
you think you have a choice Company, in rushes some loud obstreperous Hunter,
Hawker, or Jocky, good for nothing else, and Roars about Dogs, Kites, and
Horses,; and spoils that Meeting. To keep open House, and entertain the
neighboring Coxcombs is worse than being Host of an Inn: and to meet Company
elsewhere, is to be poisoned with damned Wine


I take care to meet none but good Company; and wherever we meet, we take a
course to have as good Wine from London, as any there: and at my own House, I
will entertain none but good Company


Then the Country Gentlemen, who are most of 'em ill Company, will hate you,
and you will have no Interest


He that esteems himself by another man's opinion, is an Ass. My Tenants I make
much of


But what can be the diversion of a Country Life? A man must bewak'd at three
in a Morning, by the cracked Voices of Huntsmen, with damned Bugle Horns, and
the confounded yelps of Curs: and for want of Friendship with Men, divert
themselves with their Enmity to Beasts; and hunt as if the Devil were in 'em,
till at dark night they are scarce able to dismount their Horses


They are Fops, Ned, that make a business of Sport. I hunt with my Harriers
half a dozen heats in a Morning, for Health and an Appetite: and, at Dinner
time, let 'em be in never such full cry, I knock off


There is some Reason in that; but your true Country Squire lives in Boots all
the Winter, never talks or thinks of any thing but Sports, as he calls 'em: and
if an ill Day comes, saunters about his House, lolls upon Couches; sighs and
groans, as if he were a Prisoner in the Fleet; and the best thing he can find
to do, is to Smoke, and Drink, and play at Back-gammon, with the Parson


These are of the strictest Order of Hunters, such as keep Journals of every
Days hunting, and write long Letters of Foxchases from one end of England to
the other. Tho these are Fops, Ned, a Reasonable man may enjoy himself very
well in the Country


How so?


I have a noble House, an Air pure, and uncorrupted.


Which are to be had in St. James's- Square and Hide-park.


I view my stately Fields and Meads, laden with Corn and Grass; my Herds of
Kine, and Flocks of Sheep; my Breed of Horses; my Delicate Gardens full of all
sorts of Fruits and Herbs; my River full of Fish, with Ponds, and a Decoy for
Water Fowl, and plenty of Game of all kinds in my Fields and Woods; my Parks
for Venison; my Cellar well furnished with all variety of excellent Drinks: and
all my own, Ned


All these things have we at London. The product of the best Cornfields at
Queen-Hithe; Hay, Straw, and Cattle, at Smithfield; with Horses too. Where is
such a Garden in Europe, as the Stocks-Market? Where such a River as the
Thames? Such Ponds and Decoys, as in Leaden-Hall-Market, for your Fish and
Fowl? Such Game as at the Poulterers? And instead of Parks, every Cook's Shop
for Venison, without Hunting, and venturing Neck or Arms for it. And for
Cellars, from Temple Bar to Aldgate; and all that I have use of, my own too,
since I have Money


But I have pleasure in reading the Georgies, and contemplating the Works of
Nature


I contemplate the chief Works of Nature: fine Women; and the Juice of the
Grape, well concocted by the Sun


Your fine Women, are a Company of proud, vain, Fops and Jilts, abominably
Daubed and Painted; and I had rather kiss a Blackamoor, with a Natural
Complexion, than any such: And, besides, many of them are so unsound, that
making Love is become as dangerous as making War; and the Wounds and Scars are
dishonorable to boot. Then, for your Wine, it is attended with such Surfeits,
Qualms, Head-akes, late Hours, Quarrels and Uproars, that every Scene of
Drunkenness is a very Bedlam


Poor Bellamy! thou were never happy, since thou left'st off those Noble
Maxims, Beati non numerant horas, measure not your time by Hour-glasses, but by
Wine-glasses. Oh, the sweet of a Brimmer at Midnight! The Night was made for
Beasts to sleep in, and for Man to Watch in


And if I have no other misfortune but the Head-ake, and Puking in the morning,
to hear of this Friend breaking a Collar Bone with a fall, that having his
Scull cracked by the Watch, another run through the Lungs by drunken Bullies;
and all this to Treasure up Diseases, if you shall arrive to a miserable Age


Who would not be sick ten Days for one good Night, with Men of Wit and Sense?


There Is no true Pleasure but in Health.


What should a Man do with Health in damned Country Company, which a man ought
either to be a very good Philosopher, or none at all, to endure


What good does Wit and Sense do you? do what you can, the Fops will be at
the top of Pleasures; and the Knaves will be at the head of all Business in
spite of you; and will bear down the World, that a man who has Wit can be good
for nothing


That makes the business of the World so foolishly done.


My Father is not here.


He commanded me to bid you meet him in this Room.


VVhither goes my pretty Tyrant? Though your Father be not here, here is (I am
sure) one humble Servant of yours


That I am sure of, Madam, who is tesolv'd to lay himself at your Feet, there
humbly to receive his Doom


What the Devil does he say? Is my best Friend my Rival? I hope, Madam, you are
not in doubt, who that Servant is I spoke of


What Is this? Are we Rivals? This is the greatest misfortune that could have
happened! Hold! perhaps it may be only his usual Gallantry to all young Women.
Would you could see the Wounds you make in Hearts; then, Madam, mine would
expect your pity


This is a very pretty Scene; runs smoothly off the Tongue, and is very well
Acted: Can you do it over again


Oh, Mr. VVildish! I have been searching, and sending for you, all over the
House. What? turned Flincher! Faith, I must have you down with me


Here Is my Lord's a Flincher too.


I wink at that: I can give you some Reason for that, as we go* Daughter, you
know what I have said to yeu-of this Noble man: I could not find out in all the
Nation, such a Match. Do you mind me


Yes, Sir -- But, by your good favor, I Will find out for my self, for all that.


It Is evident! What damned misfortune could have fallen out like this?


Come, faith, Mr. Wildish, you shall not escape so: Brimmers fly about handsomely*
and we are a rare Company


I must not discover my Love to this Old Fellow yet; I will knock him down,
with two or three in a Hand


How I hate this kind of Fooling! A Woman never makes so silly a Figure, as
when she is to look demurely, and stand to be made Love to.


Madam, the several Letters I have addressed to your Ladyship's hands, and my
good Orator your Father, though you never saw me, have let you know who I am; and
then you will guess what I have to say


It Is true, my Lord, I do guess, and therefore your Lordship need not trouble
your self to say it; for all Discourse, about that affair, runs to the same
Tune


I never loved before; nor can I believe that any Man loves like me.


It Is all alike. Madam, your Beauties! your excellent Accomplishments! your
extraordinary Merits! Divine, etc. The luster of your Eyes! and the rest. The
honor to kiss your fair hands! etc. All this we have in Romances, and Love and
Honor Plays. Trust me, my Lord, it is tedious


Could I incline your gentle Heart to Love, then no Discourse of it would seem
so


I cannot tell that; but as things stand now, indeed it makes me smile, to think
of a grave Mother, or, for want of her, a wise Father, putting a Daughter into
a Room, like a Hare out of a Basket, and letting him loose; that is, to act the
Part of a Lover before Marriage, and never think of it afterward. Then is she
either to frown, be peevish, or sullen, and make no answers, or very scurvy
ones; or else to blush, hold down her Head, tell the Sticks, and play with her
Fan, and say, I have no thoughts of Marriage, I am too young, it is time enough


But, Madam, a Lady of your Wit and Sense, knows it is the great end that
Woman is designed for; and it is in vain for you to speak against Love; for
every look, and every word of yours, inflames me more


There Is a word now, Inflames, and Chains, and Fetters! I warrant you; One
would think a man were a Martyr, or a Slave at Algiers at least. What
conversation might Men and Women have, did not this foolish Love interpose


It Is impossible for a Man to forbear thinking, or talking of Love, in the
presence of so Beautiful, so excellent a Lady


I could expect no less* Beautiful! Excellent! etc. How sillily one looks, who
must stand to hear her self Complemented! My Lord, you are a Man of Honor, and
I will speak plainly to you: I am resolved against Love, therefore pray deal
frankly with me: Disappoint the Old Gentleman, and let us not have one word of
it betwixt us. My happiness or ruin depends upon your Breath. I am too young
and giddy, to fix upon so solemn a business; and the pleasure I find in being
free, cannot be bought at any rate


Your Father, Madam, I hope may be a prevailing Advocate.


Hope is a very thin Diet, fit for Love in a Fever; but, to tell you true, I
am apt to believe there is no such thing as love: but, if there be, I can
assure you, you have gone the wrong way; for my Father is no Outwork of mine:
you may take him, but you are never the nearer me. I am a free Heiress of
England, where Arbitrrry Power is at an end, and I am resolved to choose for my
self. How happily am I relieved! French Count has gotten an absolute Conquest.
Let Us retire, and hear the Love betwixt them: they will divert us upon that
subject, better than we can our selves.


I must obey.


Now Monsieur le Count, we are free: we were embarrass'd with Company below,
that we could not enjoy our selves; and some so ill bred, that, eh Good, they
caused such a Chagrin in me


I am very appy in de occasion of kiss your And, in secret; indeed de Bury
Ladies be ver fine, ver prettee, and do me de great honeur;; butte, Madam, your
Luster does outshine them, as the great Sun does de leetel Star dat twinkel,
twinkel, in the Sky, Madam


Oh, Monsieur, the ebat of your Wit will make any thing appear well: I must
confess, I never have met such brillant Conversation, as from your most
agreeable person


See be de Victorious Ladee; butte, begar, see speak de dam French for all
dat.


En verity, you have Charmed them all; but, mon foy, I hate the Impertinence
of a numerous Assemblee


Oh, Madam, dear is no plaisir in de Varle, as de retirement vid so bright a
Nymp: and, Madam, I must tell dat, now you have steal me out of de Companee,
you cannot but perceive me, dat I have de ver great and signal Passion for your
Ladyship; and I have but de few littel opportunitee to say, dat, if you take no
Compassion upon me, you break mine Art; and I must kille my self vid de French
Bayonett, if you make de scorn of me


I am not so ill bred to scorn one of the Nobless.


Pray forbear, my Lord, they will come to the point presently: would you have
us play the Fool thus


If you have no scorn, de Indifferance is fatal, and vill kille me too.


Sincerement, Monsieur, a Lady cannot have indifference for a Person so bien
fait, and whose Conversation is Ravissant


She comes on handsomely.


Ah, Madam! I kiss your sweet And, for dis great honeur: butte, Madam, if my
Ambition might aspire at your Love, I will be more appy ten Tousand time, den
de great Monarch, Madam


You know very well what the Poet says: Res est Solliciti plena timoris amor.



Ver well, Madam, you be de most profound Ladee, and de great Scholar. Morbleu,
she vill find me out! Begar, I can no read.


No, no assuremant, pretty well read in the Classic Authors. Or so. Monsieur
Scudery says very well: L'amour est une grande chose


He be ver pretty Poet too. Begar, she will puzzle me.


Poet! Monsieur, he writ Romances.


Ah, Madam, in France we call de Romance, de Poeste:


Oh, Rogue! that is well come off.


And, as Monsieur Balzac says, Songez unpeu.


Dat Balzac write de very good Romance.


Indeed, I never heard that.


Je vous assure. A pox on her reading!


Take time, Sir, I beseech you; we must consider on this affair.


Madame, I have no time to consider; de grand Monarch, my Maitre, want me for
a Lieutenan General, to make de War again Holland and Flandre, to burna de
House, and to kille de Man, Voman, and Shilde, as de great Monarch does, for
his Glory. And I will speak one proud Vord for my self; he has not one
Officier in his Armee dat burn, make de Ravage, and kille de Man, Voman and
Shilde, better den my self; no indeed


Eh, mon Dieu! that is Sanglant cruelle.


Pardon me, Madam, is de Discipline of War to put de Village and de House in
flame, and vid de Pistolet to shoot de Voman paph in de Ear vid big Bellees,
and de oder vid de Shilde in dear Arm paph paph, ver dum, ver dum, paph, paph,
and to put de Pike an alf Pike into de littel Suck Shilde, and dey sprawl,
sprawl, vid deir Arm and deir Leg, and make de ver pretty Shight; and take de
littel Boy and de Garle, so high, so high, so high, and stick, and stick de
Rapier into de Bodee. Madam


This is very Bloody.


Oh, no, Madam; dey be de Enemee: de great Hero always burn and kille de Man,
Voman, and Shilde, for deir Glory


If you Heroes be so cruel, it is enough to fright a Lady.


Ah, Madam, it is de Enemee: butte to de Maitress, de Heroes be jentle as de
Lamb


This Rascal must be an Impostor: I scarce believe he is a French man; though I
have seen many a French Coxcomb, yet I never saw a French Clown before


I will assure you, he is so: it is Ned Wildish his Frolic; and it is fit you
know it, before the business go too far. I Will tell you more


Oh, the farther the better: I love mischief heartily.


If I should agree to your Honorable Proposal, I must lose you presently.


Ah, Madam, it is for mine Honeur, you fall go to my chatteau, my great House;
for I have several, vid de great Royaltee


These Ladies have entertained your, and my Lord Count's absence, with some
regret and Chagrin, suitable to the occasion


Ah, Madam, did you design to ingross my Lord Count?


That was foul play, indeed, Madam. Well, he is a fine Person!


Quelle me Impertinance! Why would you bring them, Madam? I shall be a great
Woman; he is Captivated to the last degree, he has ten thousand Pistols a year,
and great Houses and Castles


In the Air.


Oh, Fie; how her pitiful English Lord looks, in presence of my French Count.


Pray, my Lord, do my Husband the Honor to Dine with him tomorrow.


If your Lordship be not engaged, be pleased to honor my House at a Collation
this Night


My Lord, your Lordship shall do my Husdand a great Honor, to take a Repast
with him


My Lord Count --


They are all Amoreuse of him: his Eye is Cupid's Quiver, and his Beams the
Darts


So, here is a very fair Assembly!


He Is engagee to Night, Ladies.


Ladee all, you do me de very great honeur: I vish I could divide my self; but
I am engagee to wait upon this Lady, and her pretty Modere. I find, she lovee
me, by dat Lie she makee for me.


I like your Frolic admirably, for all it is yours.


So well acquainted, to tell secrets, already!


They are very familiar: ha! it is most apparent!


Serviteur, my Lor: Serviteur, Monsieur Wildish. De Ladee ^ake mush of de
French Count: ma foy, you will see presentlee


I am not a little afflicted, that I have been constrained to borrow my self so
long, from your Ladyship's most --


Oh, Fie! you smell of Tobacco to a great degree.


Ah, Madam! take my Peruke, and smelle de Pulvilio: here, Madam.


Mon Dieu! Obligeant! Here is Breeding, to divest himself of his chiefest
Ornament, to gratify my sense! it is very sine


It Is admirable, I swear!


Delicate, I vow!


Very fine!


Is de ver fine Hair, Ladee: I have a great deal of de best in England or
France, in my Shop


How? in your Shop! Do you keep Shop, Monsieur? How do you sell it?


Morbleu, vat is dis? Begar, I will bite my Tongue. Shop! Shop! I no understand
English, Shop! Vat you call de place de Jentilman put his Peruke? Oh, his
Cabinet, his Closet


Now you see, Madam Gertrude; would you have him understand English like one of
us? Je vous remercy; there is your Peruke again


Sir, be pleased to read that Chartel, and give me such an Answer.


Gentlemen and Ladies, I kiss all your hands.


Pox take de Note: Ventre bleu, I can no read; but I believe is a Shallenge.


Madam, Udsbud, we have drunk your Health in Bumpers Supernaculum.


Oh, fie! stand off.


Hold: de Ladee no love de smell de Tobac.


Are you there, in faith? I hate the sight of a French Dog, and I will pluck him
by the Nose


If I draw, dey will part me.


Oh, Insolence! save the Count, save the Count.

There were three Men came out of the West,
To make Saltpeter strong, etc.
Where are my Drunkards? where are my Drunkards? You flinchers, you sober Sots!
Where is my Iezebel, my Cockatrice, my Clogdogdo, as honest Tom Otter says? A
senceless Jade, with her Wit, and her Breeding: She steals away my Drunkards.
Old Spouse, Mummy; thou that wrap'st thy self every Night in Sear-cloths


Consider I did kille de Count, and have de Blood upon me. Vel, Monsieur, you
vill take de care o de business; Morbleu, Pox take de Note, me can no read, me
can no Fight: vat me can do vid de Shallange?


You have done rarely! let me alone; I Will protect you: but let us fly the fury
of this Drunkard


Where is my Goad? my damned for better for worse? She has stolen my Drunkards
and my Wits from me. Where are my Drunkards? Rogues, let me go to my Drunkards,
and my Wits, you Rogues

There were three Men came out of the West,
To make Salt Petre strong;
To turn it into Gunpowder
For to Charge the King's Cannon.

I Am the Count's Friend, but he will not engage me: he says, he always Kills,
for he never gives Quarter; and he will not be the occasion of my leaving my
Country. He must into France, he is a great Officer; he has laid Horses, and
will be ready to escape


Is he so inveterate an Enemy?


Yes, and Fences like a Provost: he throws in his Passes quick as Lightning,
and hits what Button he pleases


Then, if I reap the Honor of the Field, my Laurel will be greater. At the
East end of the biggest Church, you say, a quarter of an hour hence: I will not
fail. I kiss your Hands, Sir. How ever the unfortunate arrival of this Count,
who has prodigiously insinuated himself into my Mistresses affections, may have
ruffled and disordered the wonted serenity of my Temper; yet in all occasions
that may occur, I assure you, Sir, you shall ever find me Rational and Civil.
Your humble Servant: the Time fleets quick away, and Honor calls


This formal Coxcomb, I find, is stout; and the Count will find some trouble in
him: but 'twill advance the Farce, to have the Ladies, who are stark mad after
him, see or hear he is soundly Cudgelled. Humphry, if you make not haste, the
Count will be before you: he will wait alone, at the East end of the great Church


A Pox on him; does he Fence so devilishly, and never give Quarter? Bloody
Rogue! But, what care I, I make no more account of this Count, than of a
Jackanapes


Never without a Conceit!


Take me without a Jest? But I Will be gone, and make the French Count dance a
Minouet. Your Servant


This fellow may be a Coward, by his Vapouring.
Have you found the Count?

Yes, Sir* very melancholy at your Lodging, where he has told me the secrets of
his Heart: he bewailed this unlucky Quarrel, which he apprehends so much, that,
were he not sure, as he says, of the Love of Mrs. Fantast, he would leave his
Countship, and run from Bury immediately. But he is now coming hither


Well; go about yous business, and say nothing yet.


Vell, Monsieur, vat is become of dis business vid Monsieur Iean Trim?


I told him, I was your Friend, and I have appointed him a place to meet you in.


Begar, I will no meet.


I have passed my Honor, you shall be there.


Morbleu, I will no be dear: Jerny, I will tell you de secret. Dis fine Ladee
Maitres Fantast is in Love vid me: Ventre bleu, I will no fight; if I do, I am
de very great Fool indeed, to lose de great Fortune; for if dis dam Rogue run
me trough de Bodee, me lose de Maitress


How, you Rogue? Lose her! you shall never have her: as great an aversion as I
have to her, the Frolic shall not go so far


Ma foy, you be mistake: de Frolic shall go more far; yes indeed.


Don't trouble your self: I have given him that Character of you, that he
trembles at you; he will never dare come. But we must be there, for our Honors
sake


Is de Coward indeed?


I have met Sir Humphry, and I have Challenged him to Fight with you, for the
tweak he gave you by the Nose: and told him, I would be your Second


Jerny, vat is dis? Begar, I will no kille two: I will no meet dat dam Rogue,
ma foy


I have appointed him; you must be there: I believe he is a Poultron; but you
will be Cudgelled by all the Men, and scorned by all the Women, if you take the
Tweak by the Nose. Come along with me, I Will tell you more


Is better to take de Cudgel upon de Shouldere two tree four time, den to have
de Rapier trough de Bodee one time: yes, a great deal better


Allons: here is Company coming.


There goes the Rival to my Lord: Oh, may he prosper in his suit, and cure my
Lord of his short Fevor! I am sure, he can never be so mean, to love one who
shall love another. But here he comes


Not all the ill Fortune I have ever met, can equal this; that he, whom I have
loved so long, so true a Friend, so much a Man of Honor, should be my Rival! I
cannot blame him for it neither; he has broken no Trust: and any Man, that
looks upon her, must be subdued, as I am. But my hope is yet, she is unapt to
Love. Oh, Charles, did thou see Ned Wildish this Evening


Yes, my Lord: even now, he went into the Abby-ya^d.


But, what says my Mistress to the Present, and the Letter, which I sent?


She was not at home. Here is your Golden Box, full of Jewels: It is the finest
Present I ever saw made to a Lady. My Lord, I beseech your Lordship, let one of
your Gentlemen carry 'em


Is my service then become irksom to you?


Oh, no, my Lord; pray frown not: I Will plunge into the Deep, I Will run into the
Fire, to do you service. Pray be not angry


I cannot tell what it is should move thee to it; but thou art still averse to
the proceeding of my Love


I love you more than ever Servant loved a Lord: and it is my fear for you. My
Cousin in Northampton shire is of Kin to her, your Lordship knows; and I once
heard her say, she had too great a Spirit for a Wife


She has all the Beauty and Wit, of her whole Sex in her; and none of all their
Vanities. Did thou not Observe


I did, my Lord, that which your Lordship did not.


Ha! what was that?


My Lord, I fear I shall offend.


Yes, if you tell me not.


Did you not perceive she made a difference in her looks, and entertained not
every man with equal sweetness


He stings me to the Heart!


I may mistake; but yet, methinks, there is one Gentleman, whom she beholds
with greater favor, than what seems indifferent


It is her gayety of Temper: you are too Jealous.


It is for you, my Lord: pray pardon me. Alas! what Interest can I have, but
yours? I should be loath to be Officious


What means the Youth? sure, young as he is, he is in Love with her; and Love
will nourish even the highest Ambition: for why should he be so concerned?
Where is the Letter, which I ordered you to give my Mistress with the Present


It is here, my Lord.


Ha! what do I see? It Is Wildish's hand! To the fair hands of -- How came you
by this Note


My Lord, the Note? Ha! 'Twas my mistake. I did, at the beginning of my
Discourse, intend to show it to your Lordship; but found you would be too much
moved. It dropped from Mrs. Gertrude, after Dinner, and I took it up


Why did you not restore it?


I, knowing the Hand, thought I might do your Lordship service in showing it to
you. Will you not read it


Did you?


Oh yes, my Lord, knowing your Lordship was so highly concerned; and found it
so familiar --


It was Impertinent.


My Lord!


It was not honest.


My Lord, my noble Lord, pray pardon my misguided Zeal for you: impute it to my
Youth, my small Experience, my mistake of Honor; Forgive me, or my Knees shall
grow to the Earth


Rise, and learn better: to open others Letters is mean, and dishonorable.


How glad am I to have Instruction from you! You are a Man of strictest Honor!
How shall I expiate my Fault, and gain your Pardon


I pardon you, and will impute it to your want of Knowledge: and to make
atonement for it, you shall return it to her, and make her what excuse you
can: Go instantly, and find her, and give me the Present, with my Let


Into how sad, and how perplexed a case, has my too headstrong Passion brought
me, which every day increases, while my hopes grow less? What prospect have I
now, or glimps of Comfort? She, in a little time, must love as I do. What shall
I say to her? She will discover me: She said, she never saw one yet so like her
Sister, but for the color of my Hair; I overheard her: What shall I do? Hold:
If this Jealousy should make him fight with Wildish, I am lost! I Will follow
him; for, sure, I shall be Valiant in his Cause. Oh, wicked rashness


It Is a fine Moonlight night: these Fellows are Poultrons, and dare not come.


It Is de grand pity dat de Coward should be suffer to live indeed, me vould
hang de Coward. Begar, is time to go


We must stay a little: if they come, I Will run Sir Humphry through the Lungs,
while you whip the other through


Jerny, vat, stay for de Coward? Begar, I scorn to stay for de Coward: ver well
indeed, de man of Courage stay for de Coward! is no Raison for dat


I see two coming toward us; they are them two.


Pox take him, he does Love de Tilt: Ma foy, is all one for dat; begar, I will
no meet them: dey have affronte me, to make me vait so long time; and I will
put de affront upon them, an leave them now dey be come


Monsieur le Count, come back: What, will you leave me to two?


Hum, hum, hum; me vill no come back.


Mr. Wildish.


My Lord.


O, begar is my Lor; de Coward vill no come.


I have somewhat to say to you, which concerns me nearly.


My Lord, I lately have perceived something of you, that lies heavy at my heart.


I never yet met with misfortune which could equal this.


I know too well your meaning. I never yet had any Cross, which I with ease
could not have born before


We have been Friends.


Long Friends, and true.


I think so.


How, my Lord, do you but think so?


I never, till this day, had the least doubt. What pleasant Conversation, what
Endearments, what mutual Kindnesses, have passed betwixt us


And are you weary of my Friendship, that you resolve to break with me, by
doubting it? How have I loved you present? with what regret have I sustained
your absence? how often have we ventured our Lives for one another's Honor?
And am I changed, my Lord


Oh yes, Friend, we are both Changed: I have a Mistress now, so Charming, it is
impossible that I should Live without her


I have a Mistress too; so much above her Sex, so Fair, so Witty, so Engaging,
that I must Enjoy her, or I perish


How? Enjoy her! Take heed, Friend.


I mean all Honor to her.


Would you possess the Mistress of your Friend?


Would you possess the Mistress of your Friend?


How, Sir? do you Echo me?


The Case, my Lord, is so. Once, there was nothing in the World so dear to me,
as you; but, since I knew my Mistress, I would quit all that is precious in the
World, e're I would lose her


What do I hear! Sir, have you then possession of her?


A Sanguine man is never out of hope: I have her in Imagination now methinks.


Methinks, you go too fast, Sir; you know my Temper: Sir, how long do you think
that I can bear a Rival


I can consider nothing but her, and her, and only her.


You slight me, Sir.


I hope I have more manners*


Oh, how I tremble! They will Fight, and I am lost for ever!


Dey seem in de Passion. If dey two be mad, as to make de Duel, dey vill take
me for de Second, against dat littel Jentilman, de Page; and I have seen de
Page in France Fence like de Diable: he vill put his Rapier in my Bodee; me
vill steal away.


I am agreed upon Articles with her Father, who is her Guardian.


And I am endeavoring to agree upon Articles with her: which is a shorter way.


But it is not so fair a way.


How, not so fair?


No: nor can any man enjoy her, while I live.


'Sdeath! what do you say? Defend your self.


I am always ready to do that.


Help! help! murder, murder! help, help!


Hold, Sir; hold: you want a Sword; pray make use of mine.


You are generous, my Lord; my Life's yours, and so it was before, and
whatsoever I could call mine was so; except my Mistress


Let us be still such Friends: there is not a man on Earth I value equal with
you


They are embracing! blessed Heaven! I hope my Lord's not hurt:


What remains then, but we proceed like men of Reason; each take his way to
gain the Divine Creature's Love? And, since one must be for ever miserable, let
her be Arbitress of our two Fates


You still possess the same Honor which you ever had; I am now your most
unhappy, but most faithful Friend


Is de Fight done? Oh, dey embrace, is no dangere.


You most impudent Cowardly Dog! if you had not run away, you might have parted
us, and not have suffered Friends to Fight


Hold, hold: is ver well, you kick de French Count! Begar, you show de
Breeding: Kick de Count! you take me for de Barbier; ver fine, yes indeed


Sirrah, you shall be Count no longer: this Frolic shall not turn to earnest.


I will be gone, an get de Ladee, for all dat. Adieu: Jerny, me vill no stay
to be kick


My Lord, I must take off this Rogue, my Honor may be questioned: for, tho I
hate the Affected Creature, I would not have this go on to a Marriage, or a
Contract. I Will follow him


You have reason: by what I overheard, 'twill come to one of them* if you
prevent 'em not.

Come Charles, come along with me: this Evening all the Company will be in the
Fair, and there I must meet my Mistress


What deadly sound is this! On every side I am lost!


I could not have imagined, that this French Count should be so devoid of
Breeding, and the Decencies which become all Gentlemen, as to make me wait so
long, upon so important an occasion


This damned French Count will stay here for ever, I think: A Pox on him, for a
Blood-thirsty Rascal! But I will outstay him, and face him down, that I waited
here for him; and there may be hopes it may be taken up. Gad take me, he is a
Murdrous Rogue, and I will not Fight! I durst have sworn he had been a Coward


Will he never appear?


Oh, Madam, I am ruined, if my dear Count should Fight! my Passion is extreme,
as his for me


I cannot blame thee, Daughter: he is the most Charming Person, that ever my
eyes beheld


Oh, Madam, should he fall, I never can survive him! He las, mon pauvre Ceur!


Sir Humphrey was seen come into the Churchyard.


Here is Company: I must retire.


Ounds, the Rogue will find me out! he comes upon me!


Ha! who is this?


Oh pox is it he? Jack, Jack, little Jack, nown Jack, my Lad!


Jack! Jack! Jack! Sir, you are too familiar, and by your Apish Gesticulations
have endeavored to expose my Person on all occasions; for which, now we are
opportunely met; I will Chastise you, as becomes a Gentleman


Why Jack! nown Jack! what, art thou mad? Pr'y thee kiss me.


I will salute you in another manner.


Why Jack, Jack, prithee leave fooling.


Draw: or I will Sacrifice you to my just Revenge, this very individual Moment.
Have at you


Hold, hold! this Rogue will kill me.


Oh Heaven! there they are Fighting! Run, run, and save the Count! Oh, save the
--


Oh, save the Count! save the Count!


Take your Life; I give you your Life: and learn how you provoke me another
time


Pish! are these two here?


Take notice I give him his Life.


Is this all? Madam, let us go.


Come on.


Sir, you have good Fortune only, but no Valor, to boast of.


Sir, I have disarmed you, and there is an end on it.


You will return my Rapier, as becomes a Gentleman?


Gad take me, not I, till you come in the Fair: for ought I know, a Whim may
take you to fight again


Sure, I have a greater share of Honor, and a greater stock of Breeding, than
to commit such an Error against him whom Fortune has presented with that
advantage


Uds bud, I Will not trust you: follow me. But I am resolved to Cudgel this
damnable Count, for a Coward


And I likewise: and surely Cudgels will render him obnoxious to the Hate and
Scorn of Madam Fantast


I Will lay him on. Come, follow me.


That Persons should frequent Bury, and suck in no more Breeding, is I must
confess Prodigious


Where is this damned Count? Oh, here. Do you hear, Sirrah? I am told, you have
succeeded so far with this Fantastic foolish Creature, that she will Marry you


Den, begar, I have make de French Count ver vel.


If you make any farther application, I will cut your Throat. But, in the first
place, I will un-Count you, and cut off your Train, Sir


Vel, vel, vat you please: ma foy, she Love me ver vel. Sall I make de
Fornication vid her? begar, I will no Marry upon my Honeur


I had rather you should do that, than Marry her; but I will have no more Love
to her: and then carry on your Countship as much as you will; you may have your
choice of others. But be sure to use the Cowards scurvily


I warrant you, I will beat them.


Then Cudgelling will ensue.


Jerny, he cut my Troat! Begar, me make de great Laugh at dat: he no dare
behanga; me vil have de Ladee for all dis; me know de Law


Oh, Monsieur le Count, Serviteur!


Monsieur, your humble Servant.


Monsieur, I am yours, I assure you.


Oh, my Lord, we thought the Fair had lost you.


Madams, me kiss all your Hand: me would be two tree four Count for your
saka; begar, me vil make two tree four Cuckold, and Marry de Ladee too


Oh, my most cruel Mistress!


Oh, my most ungracious Servant; can I come no where, but you must cross me
with your unlucky Countenance


You can come no where, but I will endeavor to Bless my self with the sight of
yours, or I must die


Oh, that it were in my Power to make a Lover hang himself! then I would
Triumph for the rest of my poor deluded Sex. They talk of being Martyrs, and
Dying, and Dying, and such stuff; but would I could see one of 'em Die once:
that would be worth the seeing


My pretty Charming Tyrant, sure you are not so bloody minded!


Well, I am of opinion, that a Lady is no more to be accounted a Beauty, till
she has killed her Man; than the Bullies think one a fine Gentleman, till he
has killed his


I must beg leave to be a little more serious with you.


Never; why, you will come to the Point then, which I can never endure: Love in
Jest, is but just Tolerable; but serious Love is duller than a Rhyming Play


My case is now more desperate than I thought: I have discovered, that my
greatest Friend, a man of Worth and Honor, is my Rival


Never the more the desperate for that; 'twas full as desperate before: but, ^f
you be a true Friend to him, give over troubling me


How! have you then made choice of him?


Of neither: but, if I can be once rid of you, he is somewhat modester, and I
doubt not but to shake him off. Here he comes


These free-spirited Ladies are hard to be subdued: a Man may get Ten modest,
meek, and shamefaced Ladies, e're he can conquer one of these; they have not
the Heart to deny


My Lord, I beseech your Lordship, no Love in the Fair.


How hard is my Condition; who have so Cruel a Mistress, and so deserving a
Rival! and, which is most unfortunate, my greatest Friend too


In the first part of my Character, you do me too much Honor: but in the
later, you are Just


So; here is a fine Subject for a Love and Honor Poet! But you are in no danger
of him; for I am resolved to keep my self free, and incline to none* Methinks
it is Air I tread! how light I am without a yoke


Oh, my little Gatty! Ha, my Lord! here is Flesh and Blood for you! will she not
make a rare Bedfellow


By, Sir, what do you mean? Farewell.


You must both Sup with me, my Lord, and you, Sir. I have had Company with me;
and we have had such a Discourse about Wit: they, of the New Wit; and I of the
Old Wit, and my own things I writ in the last Age


Well, and you run 'em down, I make no doubt.


Servant, Ladies.


Oh, Monsieur Le Count, I am o'rejoy'd, to see you safe!


Safe, Madam! Begar, Trim and Sir Noddy be de two great Coward indeed, and me
beata them like two Dogua; yes, fait


If your pretended passion have Reality, follow me to our House: you are in
danger for my sake, and I will stick to you with my Life and Fortune; come
instantly, there are Spies upon us. Madam, come away


I come, dear Child.


Poor Rogua! she love me extrememant! Begar, Monsieur Vildish is an Ass, an me
vil have de Ladee for all him.


What? a French Barber and Peruke-maker, and no Count! Hang him, he would not
Drink, I thought there was no good in him


I am to beg a Thousand Pardons of you: 'twas my Frolic, but it is gone too far;
for, if you don't prevent it, he may marry Mrs. Fantast


Nay, faith, it is no great matter if he does: would he could marry the Mother
too; for, under the Rose, never man was so plagued with a couple of
Impertinent, Fantastic Jades, as I with them: And to complete the Affliction,
they must pretend to Wit before me, and will allow me to have none


That indeed is most unsufferable.


Ay, is it not?


Now is your time, Count, to put an affront upon that Coward.


Let me alone for dat. Begar, I am amaze, dat de Coward dare show his Face
any where: Begar, I will pluck you by de Nose, because you ^o dare me a me


And I will make that return which becomes a man of Honor to do in like cases.


Jerny, vat is dis? vat you do? You Cane de Count! Begar, you show de Breeding.
Hold, ^old: vat you do? Monsieur Vildish, my Lor, stand by me


Are you there, you Coward?


Eh, Morbleu! vat is dis?


Now it works.


Passing good, in faith! Come, let us to my House.


Come, Gentlemen, you shall go before the Alderman: he will teach you to make a
Disturbaace in the Fair


Sweet Mr. Constable: Sir, Sir; Mr. Constable, Mr. Constable!


Away with 'em, I say.


I Shall have nothing but Uproars and Quarrels in my Family: Trim and Sir
Humphry have quarreled with the Count, about Madam Fantast, with a Pox to her;
and even now my Lord Bellamy and Mr. Wildish have fought about you, as the Page
said, and I heard it


How? Fought about me!


So I say, I shall have my foolish Family the whole Discourse of this
Tittle-Tattle Town. Look you, Daughter, I knew not of Mr. Wildish's Love to
you; they have both very good Estates: but Mr. Wildish is a Wit, a great Wit,
in faith. I leave you to your Choice


I thank you, Sir: then I choose neither of 'em, nor any other.


Thou art so wild, and such a skittish Filly, you must be Tamed and Married.
Come, come* determine your choice suddenly, which they have past their Honors
shall determine them, or Battle and Murder may ensue about you


I am not so vain, to believe that.


Be not so foolish to believe otherwise. Look you, they are coming in, and you
are to sit upon Life and Death: be an upright Judge, and do not delay Justice;
I must have an end of this Suit presently. Farewell


A very grave Judge shall I be, without doubt! But I think the Petticoat may
vye for Wisdom and Sincerity, with the Long Robe, before our late Restoration


Madam, this Letter, which fell from your Ladyship accidentally, came into my
Lords hands; and he commanded me to deliver it to you, unread, and unopen'd,
tho he knew the Hand


How? my Note fallen into his hands! How unlucky was this! Ha, gone! How
strangely this Youth resembles my Sister Philadelphia! This is handsomely done
of my Lord, and like a Man of Honor


Madam, behold a pair of Rivals, hand in hand, and Friends.


Who come to prostrate themselves at your Feet, and must from your fair Mouth
expect their Doom


Oh, she will choose my Lord, and I must perish!


To whom ever you shall give leave to continue your Servant, the other will
quietly Retire, and suffer his hard Fate with all the Patience that he can: But
if I am Rejected, I shall be for ever miserable


And to me, Heaven knows, not all the World besides, can recompense the loss of
you


Ah me!


Are you resolved to be in Earnest, and would you make me so? I have not yet
determined to marry any one


Must we then both sue on, and try by constant Service to obtain your Heart?


No, no: you will oblige me more, if you will both desist. I have that Joy in
Freedom, that I cannot think of parting with it yet


You are born to Command, and always must be Free.


I love so, Madam, I must be your Slave for ever.


Yes, if you Love, so long I may keep you at my Command: but this same Whoreson
Marriage kills all Love, and makes best Friends fall out


Nothing can ever make my Love decrease.


Yes, if I love again: as Fire takes out Fire.


Not all your Cruelty can Tame my Love: which, if it be so Raging now, what
would your Kindness make it


Oh, Marriage is a Sovereign Julep; and Thirst grows less apace by Drinking.


Not where it is a Distemper, a Violent Fever; as all Love is, sure.


Too violent to last.


Madam, in short, if you do not determine which of us shall have leave to sue,
implicitly you give it both of us


Is that your Logic, Sir? No: in the first place, I never will give you leave
to make the least Address to me more


Oh, I am lost!


What Is the matter?


Your Page is in a swoon: Help, help! Open his Breast. Oh Heaven! this is a
Woman


A Woman!


She comes to herself.


Oh, Madam, I am your Sister: for Heavens sake, conceal me!


Run up privately into my Chamber quickly. I am amazed! This is Prodigious!


A Woman! Madam, I was never so surpised.


No doubt, you are surpised; and so was she: I believe she is run out of doors
in haste enough


Accursed misfortune! I am undone for ever! I Will hasten and have a full account
of all this matter





Will you be pleased then to begin with me? I am the truest Lover of my Sex.


If you are, I Will keep you so: for, should I think of Marrying you, I give up
my Dominion. No, no: I will Domineer seven years first


'Sdeath Madam, seven years! What, do you take me for a Patriarch; serve seven
years? They might stay, who begun at Fourscore to get Sons and Daughters: but I
have but a short time to live


I am sure, if I should Marry you, I should have but a short time to Reign.


Consider, Madam.


I have considered: Farewell.


How glad I am, to see you safe! Your Life is beset, for my sake; and I am
bound in Honor to protect it


Madam, you have de great share of Honeur, and de great share of de Beautee;
but for de Rival, I will beat and kille them all


They are a greater number, Monsieur, than you imagine.


Begar, all dat look upon you are de Rival; butte dey dat make de Love, I will
make de Example: I had kille two of them just now, but de Fair all rise upon me,
and make me make de Retreat


Heaven grant you be not blessee, Monsieur.


Me have no Wound, Madam, but vat you give me trough de Art: de Dangere of de
Rival, Morbleu, me despise; me vill run them trough de Bodee dus, in Quart,
Second, Tierce; hah, hah, hah.


Oh je suis rouge, you make me blush: I fear, you have decouvre more of my
Tendress, than I would have had you


Madamma, if you will make me your Husband, you stop all de insolance of de
Rival, and make me appy beyond de Varle: else, me vill be bound in Honeur to
kille two tree Rival every day, every day, Madam, and dat vill be Bloody varke;
butte is all one for dat, if you no Marry vid me, me am desperate


Tho, I must confess, I never met such Charms in any Person; yet I should be
censured for being too precipitous, in agreeing so soon to your Honorable
Proposals


Vee vill go into France, beyond de Censure, to de great Chatteau of min, as
big as Amptong Coor, vid de great Canaille, de great Park, and de grand
Royalty, vid two tree grand Chatteau beside: butte it must be sudden; for de
grand Monarque expecte me


Come, Daughter, I have been acquainted before with my Lord Count's Honorable
Passion toward you; and he is a Person of undoubted Excellence: you have full
Ten Thousand pounds; and I shall think your Fortune and your Person well
bestowed, upon a noble Gentleman of such grand Merit


Oh, fair Madamma, you do me de great Honeur: me no care for (...), it is de
Person; dis hope make me all on Flame. Madam, get de Parson, de Minister, to
dispatche de business presantlee


Sir, it is Night: it is not de Canonical hour.


Is all one: de good Roman Catolique Priest vill do it presantlee.


No, by no means; not till to morrow, Madam.


Break de Gold, and make de Contract den now: dat vill break de Art of all de
Rival, and make them sneake, like de pitiful Roga, Begar


Let it be so, Daughter: if by any accident you should lose the Count, we were
undone


Ouy sans doubt, I should be most miserable.


Oh, Luce, you are come in season.


My Lord Count, your Page is here to speak with you.


Let him come in. Hey, Page. Let all be witness of de Contract: me vill be no
Fourb, no Frippon. Upon de Knee me Swear to Marry dis Ladee Madam Fantast, to
morrow in de morning


Daughter, you must Promise: Come, never be ashamed of so transcendent a Choice.


I am Obedient: I swear to marry this Noble Person Mounsieur le Count de
Cheveux, to morrow morning


Ah, Madamma, now break de Gold, de Broad Piece: so, is done; and now, rise up
ma cher Countess


Eh, mon Chere Count!


Millions of Joys fall on you both. I weep for Joy.


Master, they have got the Report now all over the Town, that you are a Barber,
and Peruke-maker; your Equipage is revolted: Mr. Wildish's Men talk it every
where, and my Lord Bellamy's Men; and it is in every Body's mouth


Begar, dey be de Rogua, de Scoundrella: but begone from dis House, and be seen
no more here; and say, you can no find me


Somebody's coming up; a Rival, I believe;


Where, where is de Closet? Begar, I vou'd kille de Rival before your Face, but
is not Decent, Madam


Madam, I beseech you entertain 'em, while I retire with Mon cher Count.


Madam, I kiss your Ladyships fair hands.


Your Servant, sweet Mr. Trim.


Could I think to have lived to have seen this inauspitious Day, who had so
long admired the Beauty, and adored the Mind of my Divine Dorinda? That I,
having devoted not only my Heart, but all the Actions of my Life to her
Service, should be thus Sacrificed to a Frenchman


It Is a most fatal Mistake: she bears a most profound Respect toward the
worthy Mr. Trim


At his first approach, her sad indifference appeared in the Bud, which since
has sprouted up to complete Scorn; And all for this Frenchman, this false
Count, this Impostor


How? False Count!


Let me go: Begar, I will run him trough de Bodee.


You shall not* stir.


Yes; he is a false Count, and a true Barber and Peruke*maker.


Jerny, dam Rogue, make de great Lie of me! Let me go, Madamma; me vill kille
de Rogue, for dis affront


I will not part with you out of my Arms.


Sir, be not so temerarious: he is one of the Nobless, and his Nature's
vindicative in Honor's Cause


Hang him, Snip-snap Rogue, I contemn him; I Challenged him: he is a Coward,
and durst not answer my Chartel to meet me; for which, I exercised him
plentifully with this numerical Cane


O de dam Lie Rogue! Begar, me must kille him, for mine Honeur. Morbleu,
Madamma, me did beata dis Rascal, like de Spaniel Dogue, indeed


Let him Lie on: I Will revenge it.


You must pardon me, Sir, if I give not Credit to what you say: I am assured,
he is as brave a Gentleman as e're drew Sword, and a great Commander


I do averr, That he is a Barber in Pickadilly.


Ha, ha, ha: that is a Jest! My Daughter and I mistake in Breeding and Quality!


Oh, Madam, I am come to vent my just Resentments, for the Slight your Daughter
has put upon me for this damned Rascally Count, whom I tweak'd by the Nose last
Night. I Challenged him: he dared not meet; but, by Cross-biting, made Jack
here, little Jack and me meet, and fall out; and you saw me give him his Life


If you hold your own at any rate, boast not once more: if you persist, you
will awaken my Fury till it may destroy you


Prithee, Jack, hold thy peace: thou art the peevishest Fellow! But after all,
this Count of yours is a Rogue, a Cheat; he is a Barber in Pickadilly


Ha, ha, ha: as if my Daughter and I could take a Barber for a Count! Ha, ha,
ha


Udsbud, this Fellow's a Barber: I can prove it upon him.


Oh, Madamma, me beg upon de Knee dat you vill let me but kille dese two, and
me vill kille no more, upon mine Honeur. De Devil can no make de Lie so


Nay, Gad take me, I don't much care; I have a good Estate, and I shall have
Women enough Court me, where I need not apprehend a French Count, made of a
Barber and a Peruke-maker; a damned Coward too, that durst not meet me; but I
Cudgel'd him so in the Fair, Jack, hah! that he will not be very Active awhile


Ah, Madam, dey provoke me beyond de Pa^iance.


Go in, I say; and let me alone with them.


Honor! hang him, Scoundrel: Gad take me, I Cudgel'd him, till my Arm aches; a
damned Cowardly Barber and Peruke-maker


And I chastis'd him in like manner most exorbitantly.


You are insolent, thus to Traduce a Person of his Worth!


Call you this Breeding; to Challenge and abuse a Person of Quality in my
House, for his Gallantry to my Daughter


How dare you commit the Insolence, to Challenge a Person whom I favor? and
then to blacken his unspotted Fame? when I know you dare not meet him, and he
cudgel'd you


Admired Dorinda, the Faculties of whose noble Soul did use to shine more
bright, than to be led into so gross an Error as to mistake a Barber for a
Count --


Ha, ha, ha: My Lady and I mistake Breeding and Quality, and take a Barber for
a Nobleman! Mondieu, this is Malice, mere Envy of my Favors


If my Daughter and I can mistake in such material Points, who can be Judges?


Nay, for my part, Madam, if you must love a Cudgel'd Barber, and take him for
a valiant Count; make much of him, I shall desist: there are more Ladies,
Heaven be thanked


Yes, Sir, there are more Ladies: but, if any man affirms, that my fair Dorinda
has an Equal; I thus fling down my Glove, and do demand the Combat for her
Honor. This is a nice point of Honor I have hit.


Why, Jack, Jack, nown Jack; what, art thou Mad? Jack, Jack!


Prithee Jack me no Iacks; but speak with Honor of my Mistress, or Draw.


What, more Quarrels in my House!


Prithee, Jack: why, I gave thee thy Life, Man. What, a Devil, if you be so
peevish* Fare you well. Ladies, your humble Servant: and a Pox of all Cowardly
French Peruke-makers, I say


Quell insolance! I will not hear his Honor lessened so.


It Is an undoubted Verity, most inevitably true, that he is a Barber, Madam.


It Is false. It Is the basest malice to blacken men in absence: he is a Person,
in whom all Charms are met


He Charms! Alas, Dorinda, whither do you stray?


Begone: avoid my Presence.


Can my Dorinda. --


I say, begone.


Will you not hear?


No.


I obey: I say no more at present.


Monsieur, my dear Count come forth.


Ah, Madam ma Chere, mine Honeur! de Barbier! de Peruke-man! Morbleu, vy do dey
no call me de Tinkre, de Jugler, vat dey vill? If you please let me kille
dese two Rogua, you vill oblige me ver mush indeed, my dear Countess


Would you kill me, by bringing your self into that Danger? No; Let the happy
Lovers, Love and Revel: -- Hi sunt de pace triumphi
Bella gerent alios.



Here Is some coming: keep my Lord Count in your Lodging, till Three in the
morning, I will have a Coach ready to carry you to be Married


I beseech you, let me but kill one Rogua.


In, into the Closet.


But one, Madam. Call de Count, de Barbier! Jerny bleu, vat is dis?


Where is my most Wise and Subtle Spouse, with her Witty well Bred Daughter?


What have you to do with Wit, or Breeding?


Such counterfeit Breeding and false Wit, as you, old doting Fop, with the most
Affected and Fantastic Thing your Daughter do possess, I utterly renounce


What says the Antiquated Wit, with his Shreds of old Poets?


Helas! you be de very fine Judge indeed! Ha, ha, ha.


Judge; ha, ha, ha! Have a care of losing your English, before you have gotten
another Language. But, do you hear? In earnest, do you two think that you two
have either Wit, or Breeding


Think! we know we have: and that you want both, is too evident by your
Question


Yes, thou old Lumber full of Frippery, we have: while, Heaven knows, you have
neither


Ounds; what, I no Wit?


No.


No.


No, no! why, thou piece of Clock-work, thou have no Teeth; no Hair, no
Eyebrows, no Complexion, but what cost thee Money: and, but for Iron Bodice,
art as crooked as a Bugle Horn; and I have made an Epigram upon thee

She Is bent, like a Nine-pence; and had been quite broken,
Had not Nature intended the Devil a Token:
Sure, Heaven in its Indignation has made her,
And in her Mam's crooked Paunch Neck and Heels laid her.
There Is Wit, old Sybil, for thee.


That Wit, you silly old Fumbler! You are an Opprobrium to the name of Wit,
thou ill-bred old Sot


You a Wit! Eh Good! The very Spirit of Grubstreet Reigns in you.


Thou young Iezebel, with nothing natural about thee! thou look as if thou
were painted by some lewd Painter for the Sign of Folly, with such turning up
of Eyes, and screwing of Faces, with Convulsions in your Mouth: She makes wry
Mouths, and chews every word
Like an old Sow, that simpereth with a new T --
You understand me. There Is Wit for you both now, you Brace of Flirts. I no
Wit. quoth they


If Rudeness, Railing, and Ill Breeding, may pass for Wit, you are plentifully
endu'd; but I despise it


An old Soaker, with a white Head, a red Face, a Brain clouded with Fumes, and
empty of Wit, full of Whims and Maggots


Come, come, you brace of Fopdoodles, where is your French Barber you are both
so fond of; and you are to Marry, Mrs. Wit? A pox on him: if he could Marry you
both, with all my Heart


What, have you gotten that silly story too? Ha, ha.


This is raised by some London Wit, some Laugher: They call it Shamming.


A Barber! Ha, ha, ha.


Can we be deceived in Quality and Breeding?


Not know a Mechanic, a Barber, from a noble Count! very likely.





Go, Doatard, go: A Barber! Ha, ha, ha!


O filly! a Barber! Ha, ha, ha. Mondieu.


Ounds, you make me Mad, you most incorrigible pair of Fools. Well, for once,
I Will take more care of you, than you of your self: I Will have this Rogue Barber,
if he be above ground, and make an Example of him


Here Is one can tell you who your Count is.


Why, he is my Peruke-maker, and he is a Barber: I put him upon this Frolic,
thinking to make Sport in the time of the Fair; but never thought it would have
come to Earnest


Ha, ha, ha: this is finely carried on indeed!


Envy, Malice! Believe a London Wit! a Jeerer! a Scoffer! a Shammer! ha, ha, ha.


Ounds, I Will have no more Fooling about this Business: Produce this Barber; he
came into my House, has not gone out since, and you must have hid him


I hide a man in my Apartment! I defy you, insolent.


I Will see; is he not behind the Bed? or in it? Hah, I cannot find him. He must
be somewhere in these Rooms


What can provoke you to abuse my Daughter thus?


Must I, who have been Admired (I may say Adored) for Virtue, have my
Reputation questioned thus by you


Are you angry to be kept from marrying a Barber?


How dare you Domineer in my House thus?


Stand by, Old Fool. Who is in this Closet? let me see.


Oh Heaven, the Count here!


Mon dieu! how came you here?


Come, Mr. Barber, instead of Monsieur Le Count.


Vat you mean? Begar, I will have de satisfaction: and, vere it not for de
Reverence to de Ladee, Begar, me vou'd cut all your Troat, Morbleu


Why, Sirrah, Rascal, are you not my Barber and Peruke-maker? Did I not set you
up for a Count? Is not that my Suit of Cloths


Do not provoke me to run you trough de Bodee: me am amaze! Ventre bleu,
Madam, dey be all stark mad; dey Dream, and dey talk in deir Sleep: Jerny, me
can no tell vat dey mean. Do dey Treat de French Count in England dus? Oh
Brutal


If you dare persist in rhis business, I will cut your Throat infallibly.


Let me alone: Begar, you no dare be Hanga.


Nay, then it is time to speak. Good Mr. Impudence, what have you to say to my
Husband


Your Husband!


Yes, Sir, her Husband: So he is.


Yes, vat you say to dis Ladee's Husban? Ha! Morbleu!


Oh thou damnable betrayer of thy Daughter! I warrant you, I Will have a Trick
for him, and have him in the Pillory: you shall see your Husband peep through
Wood, I warrant you. Come, Sir, let us go


He is gone with some wicked Design, or other: Let us fly.


Me vill do vat you pleas, but Monseur le Count did never fly before.


Come, haste and escape, while he is gone out.


Had not my Sister, against my will, surpised me with the sight of you; I never
had seen your Eyes again, but had found out some melancholy hole, and died for
shame


I had been then completely miserable. She Is excellently Fair!


With what Confusion must I look on you! I never shall behold you, but with a
Face covered with blushes


The infinite Honor you have done me, o'rewhelms me with such shame; that,
being conscious how little I deserve, I cannot bear it: But, Madam, I will
never rise from hence, till you have pardoned me for every Command I had the
Impudence to lay upon you


There is no color for a Pardon: I owe you all the Thanks I am capable of
expressing; and I can forgive all the World, but my self. I beseech your
Lordship, impute the rashness of my Conduct to my Madness ^ that Madness which
my Father drove me to, who would have forced me to marry a Fop I hated: You I
had seen in public places often. What moved me to run to you, I know not; pray
think the best


Come, Sister, Comfort your self; such things have been done: the knowledge of
this is in a narrow compass; you differ from your self so in this habit, you
cannot be known to have worn the other


It is so much to my Advantage, that I will enquire no farther of the Cause;
but such it is, that makes me owe my Life, and all I have to you: which I shall
prostrate at your Feet


My Kinswoman, my Lady Loveland, had never assisted me in my rash design; but
that, (Distracted) I know not how, she thought I would have killed my self, had
she not answered my desires


A Thousand Blessings on her.


My Lord, I beseech you, do me the right to believe, That I intended to have
died e're you should have discovered me: for so, Heaven knows, I did


That was unkindly designed, to lock up my chief Happiness.


Here are some coming; pray retire quickly.


It Is true; this damned Count is a Barber! The Barber in Cook-row knows him,
and has seen him often at London


I am undone for ever! Lost! Wretched! Miserable! Oh me! I will hide my Head
within some Hole, and never be seen again


How? what, this man of Quality and Breeding, a Barber!


What Is that to you, Minx?


Could you mistake in Quality, and Breeding!


Oh, Impertinante!


What, married to a Barber!


How? Married!


What pity '^is?


Oh, I shall burst! He is not my Husband: I only said so, for fear my
Father-in-law and Wildish should have Murdered him in their Rage


Vat, you Renounce me? Begar, me vill make you know, dat me am your Husband.


Avaunt, thou Impudent Fellow.


I could burst my Spleen at this; but I have more serious business.


Is all one, Morbleu, if you no let me have your Person, me vill have your
Monee, Testebleu


Say you so, Sirrah? I have confined you from flying, and have Officers now to
wait on you: and I will have your Ears, and have you whipped


Is all one for dat: me vill loose de two Ear, and be wippe two, tree, four
time, for Ten Tousan pound; and, begar, me vill have de Portion, do vat you
vill


Enter: here, take him away to Jayl.


It Is no great matter: she was a Proud, Fantastic Creature.


Nay, for my part, I am glad on it.


How sneakingly he looks! He is but a pitiful Fellow!


He looks like a Barber, methinks: Lord, that I should not discover it before!


I think, I was bewitched, for my part.


That I should ever take him to be a Count!


Madam, as in Duty bound, I wish you happy in your Choice.


Madam, much Joy to you, and your Count Barber: Ha, ha, ha.


I Will run away, and never see the Face of Man again.


Mr. Oldwit, farewell; Let me have my Coach, I Will never see Bury, or you, after
this Hour


Who waits there? Bring the Coach and six Horses to the Door; and, Grooms, be
ready instantly


Farewell for ever.


We'll Kiss at parting, faith.


What, on your Knees?


Ay, faith: and never had more Reason in my life.


Pray, Sir, down on your Knees once more.


Say thou so, my Girl?


Do you know this Face?


My Daughter! Oh Heaven! Ten Thousand Welcoms! as many Blessings on thy Head!
Rise, dear Child, where have thou been? when did thou come? which way? I am
o'rjoy'd


Ask no Questions; it is no time to ask Questions: here she is.


Can thou forgive me, Child? I Will never endeavor more to force thy
Inclinations: Thou art free


It Is I must ask your Pardon, Sir.


Oh, name it not.


Now, Sir, can you part with what you love so dearly? If so, I beg her on my
Knees


How Is this? I am amazed! astonished! my Head turns round! How came this about?


By Love and Fate, that Govern every thing. I loved this Daughter, while she
was lost to you and me: and, if she will accept of me, I have all I wish on
Earth


Have I my Senses, my Lord?


Again asking Questions! Come, come, do the Duty of a Father, and bestow your
Daughter, when she has, like a free Woman, chosen for her self


My Head turns round! but come, Daughter: are you willing, Phil.?


Yes; here I will Obey.


All Joy be with you. I am not my self!


Joy to my Friend. This is a happy Turn!


I was Passionate to Marry the other Sister, because I loved her; but I think
it more reasonable to Marry this, because she loves me


Call all my Servants, lay down all my Meat to the Fire, set all my Hogsheads
abroach: Call in the Fiddlers; let us Revel for a Month at least


Hold, hold, Sir, a little. Madam, Madam.


Have you any thing to say to me?


Can you find in your Heart to dispose of your Sister to my Friend, and not of
your Self to me


Time enough to think on that, after I have tamed you, and brought you up to
hand: you are too Wild for me, a great deal


Come, Daughter, let me persuade you: Let it be a general Night of Joy.


I think I had as good: he is the most Importunate Lover, I shall never be
quiet for him. Well, I will Dissemble no longer: here is my Hand


And here is my Heart: which you shall ever Reign in, while I live.


No Raptures. And know, for all my vapouring, I can obey, as well as ever a
meek, simpering Milksop on 'em all; and have ever held Non resistance a
Doctrine fit for all Wives, tho for nobody else


Call in the Fiddlers: I am Transported! I am all Air! Sirrah, go you, and set
the Bells a going in both Churches: Call in all my Neighbors, I Will have him
hanged that is Sober to Night: let every Room in my House Roar, that it may keep
the whole Town awake. Here are the Fiddles: fall to Dancing presently; lose no
time

Let all this Night be spent in Mirth, and Wine.
Let Us lose no part of it in beastly Sleep.
This is the happy'st Day of all my Life;
I Have found my Daughter, and have lost my Wife.

I Was our Authors Advocate last year,
And then ye very gentle did appear.
To him ye now should more Indulgence show,
Eight months he has been sick, and well we know
How very little a sick man can do.
But could he Write with never so much Wit,
He must despair of seeing a full Pit:
Most of our constant Friends have left the Town,
Bravely to serve their King and Country gone.
Our unfrequented Theater must mourn,
Till the Brave Youths Triumphantly return.
Soft Men of Peace enough are left at home,
Daily to cram our House, if they would but come:
They eagerly elsewhere in throngs resort,
Crowding for Places in the well filled Court.
Here one who has been fifty years a Knave,
Strives for a Place, with one foot in the Grave.
Another there, who did what e're he could
Against the Sovereign Author of our good.
Some who rode Westward at least ten miles down,
Some made Blue Coats at him, and staid in Town.
All these would have preferment, as if they
Had to this Glorious Change prepared the way:
Thus there are more admirers to each place,
Than e're a Celebrated Beauty has.
And they who cannot that advancement gain,
They think their mighty Merits ought to attain,
Steal to some Grumbling Club, and there complain.
Pox on it, things go not well, I Will change my side,
I thought they would for my great Worth provide.
Pray have less Vanity, and learn more Wit,
Come here, we have Places for you all most fit
Within our empty Boxes and our Pit.
But you who use to hiss, pray keep away,
And try to Write before you damn a Play;
'Twill then so hard a task to you appear,
You will not have the Heart to be severe.
