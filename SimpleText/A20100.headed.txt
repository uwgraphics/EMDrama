Stay Taylour, This is the House, pray thee look the gown be not rufled: as
for the Jewels and Precious Stones, I know where to find them ready presently.
She that must wear this gown if she will receive it, is Master Iustinianos
wife (the Italian Merchant) my good old Lord and Master, that has been a
Tylter this twenty year, has sent it. Mum Tailor, you are a kind of Bawd.
Tailor, if this Gentlewomans Husband should chance to be in the way now, you
shall tell him that I keep a Hot-house in Gunpowder Ally (near crouched
Friars) and that I have brought home his wives foul Linen, and to color my
knavery the better, I have here three or four kinds of complexion, which I
will make show of to sell unto her: the young Gentlewoman has a good City
wit, I can tell you, she has red in the Italian Courtyer, that it is a
special ornament to gentlewomen to have skill in painting


Is my Lord acquainted with her?


O, I.


Faith Mistress Birdlime I do not commend my Lords choice so well: now me
thinks he were better to set up a Dairy, and to keep half a score of lusty
wholesome honest Country Wenches


Honest Coun^rey Wenches, in what hundred shall a man find two of that simple
virtue


Or to love some Lady, there were equality and coherence.


Tailor, you talk like an ass, I tell thee there is equality enough between a
Lady and a City dame, if their hair be but of a color: name you any one
thing that your citizens wi^e coms sho^t of to your Lady. They have as pure
Linen, as choice painting, lou^ green Greese in spring, Mallard and Teale in
the fall, and Woodcocke in winter. Your Citizens wife learnes nothing but
fopperies of your Lady, but your Lady or Iustice-a-peace Madam, carries high
wit from the City, namely, to receive all and pay all: to awe their Husbands,
to check their Husbands, to control their husbands; nay, they have the trick
ont to be sick for a new gown, or a Carcanet, or a Diamond, or so: and I wist
this is better wit, then to l^ar^e how to wear a Scotch Farthingale: nay more

Here comes one of the servants: you remember Tailor that I am deaf: observe
that


I thou art in that like one of our young ^ull^s, that will not understand any
wrong is done him, because he dares not answer it


By your leave Batcheller: is the gentlewoman your Mi^tris stirring?


Yes she is moving.


What says he?


She is up.


Where Is the Gentleman your Master, pray you?


Where many women desire to have their husbands, abroad.


I am very thick of hearing.


Why abroad? you smell of the Bawd.


I pray you tell her here is an old Gentlewoman would speak with her.


So.


What, will you be deaf to the gentlewoman when she comes to?


O no, she is acquainted well enough with my kn^uery.

She comes.

How do you sweet Lady?


Lady.


By Gods me I hope to call you Lady ear you dye, what mistress do you sleep
well on nights


Sleep, Ias quietly as a Clyent having great business with Lawyers.


Come, I am come to you about the old suit: my good Lord and master has sent
you a velvet gown h^are: do you like the color? three p^le, a pretty
fantastical trimming, I would God you would say it by my troth. I dreamt last
night, you looked so prettily, so sweetly, me thought so like the wisest Lady of
them al, in a velvet gown


What Is the forepart?


A very pretty stuff, I know not the name of your forepart, but it is of a hair
color


That it was my hard fortune, being so well brought up, having so great a
portion to my marriage, to match so unluckily? Why my husband and his whole
credit is not worth my apparel, well, I shall undergo a strange repo^t in
leaving my husband


Tush, if you respect your credit, never think of that, for beauty couets tich
appatell, ^hoyce diet, excellent Physic, ^o German Clock no Mathematical
Ingin: whatsoever requires so much reparation as a woman's face, and what means
has your Husband to allow sweet Docter Glister-pipe, his pention. I have heard
that you have threescore Smocks, that co^t three pounds a Smock, will these
smockes ever hold out with your husband? no, your linen and your apparel must
turn over a new^lease* I can tell you


O admirable Bawd? O excellent Birdline?


I have heard he loved you before you were ma^ryed intyrely, what of that? I
have ever found it most true in mine own experyenc^, that they which are most
violent dotards before their marryage are most voluntary Coucouldes after. Many
are honest, either because they have not wist, or because they have* not
opportunity to be dishonest, and this Italian your Husbands Countryman, holds
it impo^^ible any of their Ladies should be excellent witty, and not make the
uttermost use of their beauty, will you be a fool then


Thou do persuade me to Ill, very well.


You are nice and p^euish, how long will you hold out think you? not so long
as Ostend.


What are you? Say ye?


I forsooth.


What my most happy wife?


Why your I^aliousie?


Iealiousie: in faith I do not fear to loose that I have lost already: What
are you


Please your good worship I am a poor Gentlewoman, that cast away my self
upon an unthrifty Captain, that lives now in Ireland, I am ^aine to pick out
a poor living with selling complexion, to keep the frailty (as they say)
honest


What Is he? complexion to? you are a bawd.


I thank your good worship for it.


Do not I know these tricks,
That which thou make a color for thy sin,
Has been thy first undoing? painting, painting.

I have of all sorts forsooth? Here is the burned powder of a Hogs Iaw-bone,
to be laid with the Oil of white Poppy, an excellen^ ^^cus to kill Morphew,
weed out Freckles, and a most excellent groundwork for painting; Here is
Ginimo^y likewise burnt, and puluerized, to be mingled with the juice of
Lymmons, sublimate Mercury, and two spoonefuls of the flowers of Brimstone, a
most excellent receite to cure the flushing in the face


Do you hear, if you have any business to dispatch with that deaf goodness
there, pray you take leave: opportunity, that which most of you long for
(though you never be with Child) opportunity? I Will find some idle business in
the mean time, I will, I will in truth, you shall not need fear me, or you may
speak French, most of your kinds can understand French: god buy you. Being
certain thou art false: sleep, sleep my brain, for doubt was only that,
which fed my pain


You see what a hell I live in, I am resolved to leave him.


O the most fortunat Gentlewoman, that will be so wise, and so, so provident,
the Caroche shall come


At what hour?


Just when women and vintners are a cuni^ring at midnight. O the entertainment
my Lord will make you, sweet Wines, lusty diet, perfumed linen, soft beds, O
most fortunat Gentlewoman


Have you done? have you dispatch? it is well, and in troth what was the motion?


Motion, what motion?


Motion, why like the motion in law, that stays for a day of hearing, yours
for a night of hearing. Come lets not have Apri^l in your eyes I pray you, it
shows a wanton month follows your weeping? Love a woman for her tea^es? Let a
man love Oist^rs for their water, for women though they should weep ^cour
enough to serve a Dyer, or a Brewer, yet they may be as stale as Wenches, that
travail every second tide between Graves end, and Billingsga^e


This madness shows very well.


Why look you, I am wondrous merry, can any man discern by my face, that I
am a Cuckold? I have known many suspected for men of this misfortune; when they
have walked through the streets, wear their hats ore their eyebrows, like
pollitick pen^houses, which commonly make the shop of a Mercer, or a Linen
Draper, as dark as a room in Bedlam. His cloak shrouding his face, as if he
were a Neopolitan that had lost his beard in April, and if he wa'k through the
street, or any other narrow read (as it is rate to meet a Cuckold) he duckes at
the penthouses, like an Ancient that dares not flourish at the oath taking of
the Praetor, for fear of the signe-posts? Wife, wife, do I any of these? Come
what news from his Lordship? has not his Lordships virtue once gone against
the hair, and coueted corners


Sir, by my soul I will be plain with you.


Except the forehead dear wife, except the forehead.


The Gentleman you spoke of has often solicited my love, and has received
from me most chaste denials


I, I, provoking resistance, it is as if you come to buy wares in the City, bid
money fort, your Mercer, or Goldsmiths says, truly I cannot take it, lets his
customer pass his stall; next, nay perhaps two, or three, but if he find he
is not prone to return of himself, he calls him back, and back, and takes
his money: so you my dear wife, (O the policy of women, and Tradsmen: they will
bite at any thing.


What would you have me do? all your plate and most part of your Jewels are at
pawn, besides I hear you have made over all your esta^e to men in the Town
here? What would you have me do? would you have me turn common sinner, or
sell my apparel to my wastcoat and become a Landresse


No Landresse dear wife, though your credit would go far with Gentlemen for
taking up of Linen: no Landresse


Come, come, I will speak as my misfortune prompts me, Iealiousie has undone
many a Citizen, it has undone you, and me. You married me from the ^eruice of
an honorable Lady, and you knew what matches I might have had, what would you
have me to do? I would I had never seen your eyes, your eyes


Very good, very good.


Your prodigality, your diceing, your riding abroad, your consorting your self
with Noble men, your building a summer house has undone us, has undone us?
What would you have me do


Any thing: I have sold my House, and the wares int? I am going for Stoad next
tide, what will you do now wife


Have you indeed?


I by this light als one, I have done as some Citizens at thirty, and most
heirs at three and twenty, made all away, why do you not ask me now what you
shall do


I have no counsel in your voiag^, neither shall you have any in mine.


To his Lordship: will you not wife?


Even whether my misfortune leads me.


Go, no longer will I make my care thy prison.


O my fate; well sir, you shall answer for this sin which you force me to;
fare you well, let not the world condemn me, if I seek for mine own
maintenance


So, so.


Do not send me any letters; do not seek any reconcilement. By this light I Will
receive none, if you will send me my apparel so, if not choose, I hope we
shall neare-meete more


So, farewell the acquaintance of all the mad Devils that haunt Iealiousie, why
should a man be such an ass to play the antic for his wives appetite?
Immagine that I, or any other great man have on a velvet Nightcap, and put
case that this nightcap be to little for my ears or forehead, can any man
tell me where my Nightcap wringes me, except I besuch an ass to proclaim
it; Well, I do play the fool with my misfortune very hand somly. I am glad
that I am certain of my wives dishonesty; for a secret strumpet, is like mines
prepared to ruin goodly buildings. Farewell my care, I have told my wife I am
going for Stoad; that's not my course, for I resolve to take some shape upon me,
and to live disguised here in the City; they say for one Cuckolde to know
that his friend is in the like head-ake, and to give him counsel, is as if
there were two partners, the one to be arrested, the other to bail him: my
estate is made oue^ to. My friends, that do verily believe, I mean to leave
England. Have amongst you City dames? You that are indeed the fittest, and
most proper persons for a Comedy, nor let the world lay any imputation upon my
disguise, for Court, City, and Country, are merely as maskes one to the
other, envied of some, laughed at of others, and so to my comicall business


Moll.


What would heart?


Where Is my Casheire, are the sums right? Are the bonds sealed?


Yea sir.


Will you have the bags sealed?


O no sir, I must disburs instantly* we that be Courtyers have more plac^s to
send money to, then the devil has to send his spirits: there is a great deal of
light gold


O sir, twill away in play, and you will stay till to morrow you shall have it
all in new sovereigns


No, in-troth it is no matter, twill a way in play, let me see the bond? let me
see when this money is to be paid? the tenth of August. The first day that I
must tender this money, is the first of Dog-daies


I fear twill be hot staying for you in London then.


Scriuener, take home the bond with you. Will you stay to dinner sir? Have you
any Partridge Moll


No in-troth heart, but an excellent pickeld Goose, a new service: pray you stay.


Sooth I cannot: by this light I am so infinitely, so vnboundably beholding to
you


Well Signior, I Will leave you; My cloak there?


When will you come home heart?


In Troth self I know not, a friend of yours and mine has broke.


Who sir?


Master Iustini^no the Italian.


Broke sir.


Yea sooth, I was offered forty yesterday upon the Exchange, to assure a hundred.


By my troth I am sorry.


And his wife is gone to the party.


Gone to the party? O wicked creature?


Farewell good master Monopoly, I pre-thee visit me of^n.


Little Moll, send away the fellow?


Phill. Phillip.


Here forsooth.


Go into Bucklers-bury and fetch me two ounces of preserved Melounes, look
there be no Tobacco taken in the shop when he weighes it


I forsooth.


What do you eat preserved Melonnes for Moll?


In Troth for the shaking of the heart, I have here sometime such a shaking, and
downwards such a kind of earthquake (as it were.


Do you hear, let your man carry home my money to the ordinary, and lay it in
my Chamber, but let him not tell my host that it is money: I owe him but forty
pound, and the Rogue is hasty, he will follow me when he thinks I have money,
and pry into me as Crows perch upon Carrion, and when he has found it out,
prey upon me as Heraldes do upon Funerals


Come, come, you owe much money in Town: when you have forfeited your bond, I
shall near see you more


You are a Monky, I Will pay him for's day: I Will see you tomorrow to.


By my troth I love you very honestly, you were never the gentleman offered any
vnciuility to me, which is strange methinks in one that comes from beyond Seas,
would I had given a Thousand pound I could not love thee so


Do you hear, you shall feign some scuruy disease or other, and go to the Bath
next spring,


By your leave sweet mistress Tenterhooke.


O, how do partner?


Gentlewomen I stayed for a most happy wind, and now the (...) your sweet,
sweet lips, should set me going: good mistress Honisuckle; good mistress Wafer,
good mistress Tenterhooke, I will pray for you, that neither riuallshippe in
loves, pureness of painting, or riding out of town, not acquainting each other
withit, be a cause your sweet beautyes do fall out, and rail one upon another


Rail sir, we do not use to rail.


Why mistress, railing is your mother tongue as well as lying.


But, do you think we can fall out?


In troth beauties (as one spoke seriously) that there was no inheritance in
the amity of Princes, so think I of Women, too often interviewes amongst
women, as amongst Princes, breeds envy often to others fortune, there is only in
the amity of women an estate for will, and every puny knows that is no
certain inheritance


You are merry sir.


So may I leave you most fortunat gentlewoman.


Love shoots hear.


Tenterhooke, what Gentleman is that gone out, is he a man?


O God and an excellent Trumpetter, He came lately from the university, and
loves City dames only for their victuals, he has an excellent trick to keep
Lobsters and Crabs sweet in summer, and calls it a devise to prolong the days
of shel-fish, for which I do suspect he has been Clarke to some Noblemans
kitchen. I have heard he never loves any Wench, tell she be as stale as
Frenchmen eat their wild foul, I shall anger her


How stale good Mistress nimble-wit?


Why as stale as a Country Ostes, an Exchange Sempster, or a Court Landresse.


He is your consin, how your tongue runs?


Talk and make a noise, no matter to what purpose, I have learned that with
going to puritan Lectures. I was yesterday at a banquet, will you discharge my
ruffes of some wafers, and how does thy husband Wafer


Faith very well.


He is just like a Torch bearer to Maskers, he wears good clothes, and is
rankt in good company, but he does nothing: thou art feign to take al, and pay
all


The more happy she, would I could make such an ass of my husband to. I hear
say he breeds thy child in his teeth every year


In faith he does.


By my troth it is pity but the fool should have the other two pains incident
to the head


What are they?


Why the head-ake and horne-ake. I heard say that he would have had thee nursed
thy Child thy self to


That he would truly.


Why there is the policy of husbands to keep their Wines in. I do assure you if
a Woman of any markeable face in the World give her Child suck, look how
many wrinckles be in the Nipple of her breast, so many will be in her forheade
by that time twelve month: but sir, we are come to acquaint thee with an
excellent secret: we two learn to write


To write?


Yes believe it, and we have the finest School master, a kind of Precision,
and yet an honest knave to: by my troth if thou be a good wench let him
teach thee, thou may send him of any arrant, and trust him with any secret;
nay, to see how demurely he will bear himself before our husbands, and how
iocand when their backs are turned


For Gods love let me see him.


To morrow we will send him to thee: til then sweet Tenterhook we leave thee,
wishing thou may have the fortune to change thy name often


How? change my name?


I, for thieves and widows love to shift many names, and make sweet use of it
to


O you are a wag indeed. Good Wafer remember my school master. Farewell good
Hon^suckle


Farewell Tenterhooke.


Beniface, make an end of my cloak and Cap.


I have dispatch em Sir: both of them lie flat at your mercy.


Fore-god me thinks my joints are nimbler every Morning since I came over then
they were before. In France when I rise, I was so stiff, and so stark, I
would ha sworn my Legs had been wodden pegs: a Constable new chosen kept not
such a peripateticall gate: But now I Am as Lymber as an Antiant that has
flourisht in the rain, and as Active as a Norfolk tumbler


You may see, what change of pasture is able to do.


It makes fat Calves in Rumny Marsh, and lean knaves in London: therefore
Boniface keep your ground: Gods my pity, my forehead has more cromples, then
the back part of a counselors gown, when another rides upon his neck at the
bar: Boniface take my helmet: give your mistress my nightcap. Are my Antlers
swollen so big that my biggen pinches my brows. So, request her to make my
headpiece a little wyder


How much wider sir.


I can allow her almost an y^ch: go, tell her so, very near an inch.


If she be a right Citizens wife, now her Husband has given her an inch,
she will take an ell, or a yard at least


Master Parenthesis! Salve, Salve Domine.


Salve tu quoque Iubeo te saluere plurimum.


No more Plurimums if you love me, lattin whole-meate^ are now minced, and
serude in for English Gallimafries: Let us therefore cut out our vplandish
Neates tongues, and talk like regenerate Britains


Your worship is welcome to England: I powrd out Orisons for your arrival.


Thanks good master Parenthesis: and Que nouelles: what news flutters abroad?
do Iack-dawes dung the top of Paul's Steeple still


The more is the pity, if any dawes do come into the temple, as I fear they
do


They say Charing-crosse is falue down, since I went to Rochell: but that's no
such wonder, it was old, and stood awry (as most part of the world can tell.) And
tho it lack vnder-propping, yet (like great fellows at a wrestling) when their
heels are once flying up, no man will save em; down they fall, and there
let them lie, tho they were bigger then the Guard: Charing-crosse was old, and
old things must shrink as well as new Northern cloth


Your worship is in the right way verily: they must so, but a number of better
things between Westminster bridge and temple bar both of a worshipful, and
honorable erection, are fallen to decay, and have suffered putrefaction, since
Charing fell, that were not of half so long standing as the poor wry-neckt
Monument


Whose within there? One of you call up your mistress! tell her heeres her
writing Schoolmaster. I had not thought master Parenthesis you had bin such an
early stirrer


Sir, your vulgar and foure-peny-pen-men, that like your London Sempsters keep
open shop, and sell learning by retaile, may keep their beds, and lie at their
pleasure: But we that edify in private, and traffic by whole sale, must be up
with the lark, because like Country Atturnies, we are to shuffle up many
matters in a for-enoone. Certes master Honisuckle, I would sing Laus Deo, so I
may but please al those that come under my fingers: for it is my duty and
function, Perdy, to be fervent in my vocation


Your hand: I am glad our City has so good, so necessary, and so laborious a
member in it: we lack painful and expert penmen amongst us. Master
Parenthesis you teach many of our Merchants sir, do you not


Both Wives, Maids, and Daughters: and I thank God, the very worst of them
lie by very good men's sides: I pick out a poor living amongst em, and I am
thankful for it


Trust me I am not sorry: how long have you exercizd this quality?


Come Michaell-tide next, this thirteen year.


And how does my wife profit under you sir? hope you to do any any good upon
her


Master Honisuckle I am in great hope she shall fructify: I will do my best
for my part: I can do no more then another man can


Pray sir ply her, for she is capable of any thing.


So far as my poor tallent can stretch, It shall not be hidden from her.


Does she hold her pen well yet?


She leanes somewhat too hard upon herpen yet sir, but practice and
animaduersion will break her from that


Then she grubs her pen.


Its but my pains to mend the neb again.


And where abouts is she now master Parenthesis? She was talking of you this
morning, and commending you in her bed, and told me she was past her letters


Truly sir she took her letters very suddenly: and is now in her Minoms.


I would she were in her Crotchets too master Parenthesis: ha-ha, I must talk
merrily sir


Sir so long as your mirth be void of all Squirrility, it is not unfit for your
calling: I trust ere few days be at an end to have her fall to her joining:
for she has her letters ad vnguem: her A. her great B. and her great C. very
right D. and E. dilicate: her double F. of a good length, but that it straddels
a little to wide: at the G. very cunning


Her H. is full like mine: a goodly big H.


But her: double LL is well: her O. of a reasonable Size: at her p. and q.
neither Marchantes Daughter, Aldermans Wife, young country Gentlewoman, nor
Courtiers Mistress, can match her


And how herv.


You sir, She fetches up you best of al: her single you she ca^ fashion two or
three ways: but her double you, is as I would wish it


And faith who takes it faster; my wife, or mistress Tenterhook?


Oh! Your wife by ods: she will take more in one hour, then I can fasten either
upon mistress Tenterbooke, or mistress Wafer, or Mistress Flapdragon (the Brewers
wife) in three


Do not thy cheeks burn sweet chuckaby, for we are talking of thee.


No goodness I warrant: you have few Citizens speak well of their wives
behind their backs: but to their faces thei^e cog worse and be more suppliant,
then Clyents that sue in forma paper: how does my master? troth I am a very
trewant: have you your Ruler about you master? for look you, I go clean awry


A small fault: most of my scholars do so: look you sir, do not you think
your wife will mend: mark her dashes, and her strokes, and her breakings, and
her bendings


She knows what I have promised her if she do mende: ^ay by my fay Jude, this
is well, if you would not fly out thus, but keep your line


I shall in time when my hand is in: have you a new pen for me Master, for by
my truly, my old one is stark naught, and will cast no inck: whether are you
going lamb


To the Custom House: to the Change, to my VVarehouse, to diverse places.


Good Cole tarry not past eleven, for you turn my stomak then from my dinner.


I will make more have home, then a Stipendary Swizzer does after he is paid,
fare you well Master Parenthesis


I am so troubled with the rheum too: Mouse what is good fort?


How often have I told you, you must get a patch. I must hence.


I think when als done I must follow his counsel, and take a patch, I have
had one long ere this, but for disfiguring my face: yet I had noted that a
masticke patch upon some women's Temples, has bin the very rhe^wme of beauty


Is he departed? Is old Nestor marched into Troy?


Yes you mad Greek: the Gentleman's gone.


Why then clap up coppy-bookes: down with pens, hang up inckhornes, and now
my sweet Honisuckle, see what goldenwinged Be from Hybla, flies humming, with
Crura thymo plena, which he will empty in the Hiue of your bosom


From whom.


At the skirte of that sheet in black work is wrought his name, break not
up the wildfoule, till anon, and then feed upon him in private: there is other
irons in the fire: more sackes are coming to the Mill, O you sweet temptations
of the sons of Adam, I commend you, extol you, magnify you: Were I a Poet
by Hipocrene I swear, (which was a certain Well where all the Muses watered)
and by Pernassus eke I swear, I would ^ime you to death with praises, for that
you can be content to lie with old men all night for their money, and walk to
your gardens with young men in the day time for your pleasure: Oh you delicat
damnations: you do but as I wud do: were I the proprest, sweetest, plumpest,
Cherry-cheekt, Corrall-lipt woman in a kingdom, I would not dance after one
man's pipe


And why?


Especially after an old man's.


And why, pray!


Especially after an old Citizens.


Still, and why.


Marry because the Suburbs, and those without the bars, have more privilege
then they within the freedom: what need one woman do ate upon one Man? Or one
man be mad like Orlando for one woman


Troth it is true, considering how much flesh is in every Shambles.


Why should I long to eat of Bakers bread only, when there is so much Sifting,
and bolting, and grynding in every corner of the City; men and women are
borne, and come running into the world faster then Coaches do into Cheap Side
upon Simon and Iudes day: and are eaten up by Death faster, then Mutton and
porridge in a term time. Who would pin their hearts to any Sleeue: this world
is like a Mynt, we are no sooner cast into the fire, taken out again, hamerd,
stamped, and made Current, but presently we are changde: the new Money (like a
new Drab) is caught at by Dutch, Spanish, Welsh, French, Scotch, and English:
but the old cracked King Harry groates are shoueld up, feel bruzing, and
battring, clipping, and melting, they smoke sort


The worlds an Arrant naughty-pack I see, and is a very scuruy world.


Scuruy? worse then the conscience of a Broomeman, that carries out new ware,
and brings home old shoes: a naughty-packe? Why there is no Minute, no thought of
time passes, but some villainy or other is a brewing: why, even now, now, at
holding up of this finger, and before the turning down of this, some are
murdring, some lying with their maids, some picking of pockets, some cutting
purses, some cheating, some weying out bribes. In this City some wives are
Cuckolding some Husbands. In yonder Village some farmers are now-now grynding
the Iawbones of the poor: therefore sweet Scholar, sugared Mistress
Honisuckle, take Summer before you, and lay hold of it? why, even now must you
and I hatch an egg of iniquity


Troth master I think thou will prove a very knave.


Its the fault of many that fight under this band.


I shall love a Puritans face the worse whilst I live for that Copy of thy
countenance


We are all wethercocks, and must follow the wind of the present: from the
byas


Change a bowl then.


I will so; and now for a good cast: there is the Knight, sir Gos^n Glo-worme.


He Is a Knight made out of wax.


He took up Silks upon his bond I confess: nay more, he is a knight in
print: but let his knighthood be of what stamp it will, from him come I, to
entreat you, and Mistress Wafer, and mistress Tenterhook, being both my
scholars, and your honest pew fellows, to meet him this afternoon at the
Rhenesh-wine-house ith Stillyard. Captain Whirlepoole will be there, young
Lynstock the Alder-mans Son and Heir, there too, will you steal forth, and
taste of a Dutch Bun, and a Keg of Sturgeon


What excuse shall I coin now?


Few excuses: You must to the pawn to buy Lawne: to Saint Martins for Lace; to
the Garden: to the Glasse-house; to your Gossips: to the Powlters: else take
out an old ruff, and go to your Sempsters: excuses? Why, they are more ripe
then medlers at Christmas


I Will come. The hour.


Two: the way-through Paul's: every wench take a pillar, there clap on your
Maskes: your men will be behind you, and before your prayers be half don, be
before you, and man you out at several doors. You Will be there


If I breath.


Farewell. So: now must I go set the the other Wenches the self same Copy. A
rare Scholemaister, for all kind of hands, I. Oh: What strange curses are
powered down with one blessing? Do all tread on the heel? Have all the art to
hood-winke wise men thus? And (like those builders of Babels Tower) to speak
unknown tongues. Of all (save by their husbands) understood: Well, if (as Iuy
bout the Elm does twine

All wives love clipping, there is no fault in mine.
But if the world lay speechles, even the dead
Would rise, and thus cry out from yawning graves,
Women make men, or Fools, or Beasts, or Slaves.

Her answer! talk in music: Will she come?


Oh my sides ache in my loins, in my bones? I ha more need of a posset of
sack, and lie in my bed and sweat, than to talk in music: no honest woman
would run hurrying up and down thus and undo her self for a man of honor,
without reason? I am so lame, every foot that I set to the ground went to my
heart. I thought I had bin at Mum-chance my bones ratled so with iaunting? had it
not bin for a friend in a corner.


Minister comfort to me, Will she come.


All the Castles of comfort that I can put you into is this, that the jealous
wittal her husband, came (like a mad Ox) belowing in whilst I was there. Oh I
ha lost my sweet breath with trotting


Death to my heart? her husband? What says he?


The freeze-lerkin Rascal out with his purse, and called me plain Bawd to my
face


Affliction to me, then thouspak'st not to her?


I spoke to her, as Clients do to Lawiers without money (to no purpose) but I Will
speak with him, and hamper him to, if eue^ he fall into my clutches: I Will make
the yel^ow-hammer her husband know, (for all he is an Italian) that there is a
difference between a cogging Baud and an honest motherly gentlewoman. Now,
what cold whetstonesly over your stomacher? will you have some of my Aqua? Why
my Lord


Thou have killed me with thy words.


I see bashful lovers and young bullockes are knocked down at a blow: Come,
come* drink this draught of Cynamon water, and pluck up your spirits: up with
em, up with em. Do you hear, the whiting mop has nibled


Ha?


Oh? I thought I should fetch you: you can Ha at that: I Will make you Hem anon.
As I Am a sinner I think you will find the sweetest, sweetest bedfellow of her. Oh!
she looks so sugredly, so simpringly, so gingerly, so amarously, so amiably.
Such a red lip, such a White foreheade, such a black eye, such a full
cheek, and such a goodly little nose, now she is in that French gown, Scotch
falls, Scotch bum, and Italian head-tire you sent her, and is such an intycing
shee-witch, carrying the charms of your Jewels about her. O^^


Did she receive them? speak: Here Is is golden keys T'vnlock thy lips. Did she
vouchsa^e to take them


Did she vouchsafe to take them, there is a question: you shall find she did
vouchsafe: The troath is my Lord, I got her to my house, there she put off
her own cloths my Lord and put on yours my Lord, provided her a Coach, Searched
the middle I Will in Pawles, and with three Elizabeth twelue-pences pressed three
knaves my L. hirde three Liueries in Long-lane, to man her: for all which so God
mend me, I Am to pay this night before Sunset


This shower shall fill them al^raine in their laps, what golden drops thou will.


Alas my Lord, I do but receive it with one hand, to pay it away with another,
I Am but your Baily


Where is she?


In the green velvet Chamber; the poor sinful creature pants like a pigeon
under the hands of a Hawke, therefore use her like a woman my Lord: use her
honestly my Lord, for alas she is but a Nouice, and a very green thing


Farewell: I Will in unto her.


Fie vpont, that were not for your honor: you know gentlewomen use to come to
Lords chambers, and not Lords to the Gentlewomens; I Would not have her think you
are such a Rank-ryder: walk you here: I Will becken, you shall see i will fetch her
with a wet finger


Do so.


Hyst? why sweet heart, mistress Iustiniano, why pretty soul tread softly,
and come into this room: here be rushes, you need not fear the creaking of
your cork shoes. the marks are set up: I Will get me (...) score off, and give
Aim


Yare welcome: Sweety'are welcome. Bless my hand
With the soft touch of yours: Can you be Cruel
To one so Prostrate to you? Even my Heart,
My Happiness, and State lie at your feet:
My Hopes me flattered that the field was won,
That you had yielded, (tho you Conquer me)
And that all Marble scales that bard your eyes
From throwing light on mine, were quite taken off,
By the Cunning Woman's hand, that Works for me,
Why therefore do you wound me now with frowns?
Why do you fly me? Do not exercise
The Art of woman on me? I Am already
Your Captive: Sweet! Are these your hate, or ^eares.

I wonder lust can hang at such white hairs.

You give my love ill names, It is not lust:
Lawless desires well tempred may seem Just
A thousand mornings with the early Sun, mine eyes have from your windows
watched to steal brightness from those. As often upon the days that Consecrated
to devotion are, Within the Holy Temple have I stood disguised, waiting your
presence: and when your hands went up toward heaven to draw some blessing
down, Mine (as if all my Nerves by yours did move,

Begged in dum Signs some pity for my Love,
And thus being feasted only with your fight,
I went more pleased then sickmen with fresh health,
Rich men with Honor, Beggars do with wealth.

Part now so pleased, for now you more Enjoy me.

O you do wish me Physic to destroy me.

I have already leapt beyond the bounds of modesty, In piecing out my wings
with borrowed feathers: but you sent a Sorceres so perfect in her trade, that
did so lively breath forth your passionate Accents, and could draw a Lover
languishing so piercingly, that her charms wrought upon me, and in pity of
your sick heart which she did Counterfeit, (Oh she is a subtle Beldam!) See I
clothed my limbs (thus Player-like in Rich Attyres, not fitting mine estate,
and am come forth, but why I know not


Will you Love me?


Yes,
If you can clear me of a debt that's due but to one Man,
I Will pay my heart to thee.

Whose that?

My Husband.

Vmh.

The sums so great
I know a kingdom cannot answer it,
And therefore I beseech you good my Lord,
To take this gilding off, which is your own,
And henceforth cease to throw out golden hooks
To choke mine honor: tho my husbands poor,
I Will rather beg for him, then be your Whore.

Against beauty you plot treason, if you suffer tears to do violence to so fair
a Cheek. That face was nere made to look pale with want. Dwell here and be
the Sovereign of my fortunes. Thus shall you go attired


Till lust be tired. I must take leave my Lord.


Sweet Creature stay,
My Cofers shall be yours, my Servants yours,
My self will be your servant, and I swear by that which I hould^ dear in
you, your beauty (and which I Will not profane) you shall live here as free from
base wrong, as you are from blackenesse, so you will deigne, but let me enjoy
your sight, Answer me will you


I will think vpont.


Unless you shall perceive, that al my thoughts, and al my actions be to you
devoted, and that I very justly earne your love, Let me not taste it


I will think upon it.


But when you find my merits of full weight, will you accept their worth.


I Will think vpont.
I Would speak with the old woman.

She shall come,
Joys that are borne unlooked for, are borne dumb.

Po^erty, thou bane of Chastity,
Poison of beauty, Broker of Mayden-heades,
I see when Force, nor Wit can scale the hold, Wealth must. Sheel^ nere be won,
that defies go^de

But lives there such a creature: Oh it is rare.
To find a woman chaste, that's poor and fair.

Now lamb! has not his Honor dealt like an honest Nobleman with you. I can tell
you. you shall not find him a Templer, nor one of these cogging Cattern
pear-coloured-beards, that by their good (...) wou^d have no pretty woman escape
them


Thou art a very bawd: thou art a Devil
Cast in a reverend shape; thou stale damnation!
Why have thou me intist from mine own Paradise,
To steal fruit in a barren wilderness.

Bawd and devil, and stale damnation! Will women's tounges (like Bakers legs)
never go straight


Had thy Circaean Magic me transformd
Into that sensual shape for which thou Coniurst,
And that I were turned common Veuturer,
I could not love this old man.

This old man, vmh: this old man? do his hoarye hairs stick in your
stomach? yet methinkes his silver hairs should move you, they may serve to
make you Bodkins: Does his age grieve you? fool? Is not old wine wholesommest,
old Pippines toothsommest, old wood burn brightest, old Linen wash whitest,
old soldiers Sweet-hart are surest, and old Lovers are soundest. I hatried
both


So will not I.


Youd have some young perfumed beardles Gallants board you, that spits al his
brains out ats tongues end, wud you not


N^, none at al, not any.


None at al? what do you make there then? why are you a burden to the worlds
conscience, and an eie-sore to well given me^, I dare pawn m^ gown and all the
beds in my house, and all the gettings in Michaelmas term next to a Tavern
token, that thou shall never be an innocent


Who are so?


Fools? why then are you so precize: your husbands down the wind and will you
like a haglers Arrow, be down the weather, Strike whilst the iron is hot. A
woman when there be roses in her cheeks, Cherries on her lips, Ciuet in her
breath, Iuory in her teeth, Lyllyes in her hand, and Lickorish in her heart,
why she is like a play. If new very good company, very good company, but if
stale, like old Ieronimo: go by, go by. Therefore as I said before, strike.
Besides: you must think that the commodity of beauty was not made to lie dead
upon any young woman's hands: if your husband have given up his Cloak, let
another take measure of you in his Ierkin: for as the Cobbler, in the night time
walks with his Lantern, the Merchant, and the Lawyer with his Link, and the
Courtier with his Torch: So every lip has his Lettice to himself: the Lob has
his Less, the Collier his Dowdy, the Western- man his Pug, the Seruing-man
his Punke, the student his Nun in white Friars, the Puritan his Sister, and the
Lord his Lady: which worshipful vocation may fall upon you, if you will but
strike whilst the Iron is hot


Witch: thus I break thy Spells: Were I kept brave, On a Kings cost, I am but a
Kings slave


I see, that as Frenchmen love to be bold, Flemings to be drunk, Welchmen to
be called Brittons, and Irishmen to be Costermongers, so, Cocknyes, (especially
Shee-Cocknies) love not Aq^a-vite when tis-good for them


Saw you my uncle?


I saw him even now going the way of all flesh (that's to say) toward the
Kitchen: heeres a letter to your worship from the party


What party?


The Tenterbook your wanton.


From her? Fewh? pray thee stretch me no more upon your Tenterhook: pox on
her? Are there no Pottecariesith Town to send her Phisick-bils to, but me:
She Is not troubled with the green sickness still, Is she


The yellow I aundis, as the Doctor tells me: troth she is as good a peat: she is
fallen away so, that she is nothing but bare skin and bone: for the Turtle so
mournes for you


In black?


In black? you shall find both black and blew if you look under her eyes.


Well: sing over her ditty when I Am in tune,


Nay, but will you send her a Box of Mithridatum and Dragon water, I mean some
restoratiue words. Good Master Monopoly yo^ know how welcome yare to the
City, and will you master Monopoly, keep out of the City; I know you cannot,
would you saw how the poor gentlewoman lies


Why how lies she?


Troth as the way lies over Gads-hill, very dangerous: you would pity a woman's
case if you saw her: write to her some treatise of pacification


I Will write to her to morrow.


To morrow; she will not sleep then but tumble, and if she might have it to
night, it would better please her


Perhaps I Will doot to night, farewell.


If you doot to night, it would better please her then to morrow.


Gods so, do hear, I Am to sup this night at the Lion in Sh^redich with
certain gallants: can thou not draw forth some dilicate face, that I ha not
seen, and bring it thither, wut thou


All the painters in London shall not fit for color as I can; but we shall have
some swaggering


All as civil (by this sight) as Lawyers.


But I tell you, she is not so common as Lawyers, that I mean to betray to your
Table: for as I Am a Sinner, she is a Knights Cozen; a Yorkshire gentlwoman, and
only speaks a little broad, but of very good carriage


Nay that's no matter, we can speak as broad as she? but wut bring her?


You shall call her Cozen, do you see: two men shall wait upon her, and I Will
come in by chance: but shall not the party be there


Which party?


The writer of that simple hand.


Not for as many Angels as there be letters in her Paper: Speak not of me to
her, nor our meeting if you love me: wut come


Mum, I Will come.


Farewell.


Good Master Monopoly, I hope to see you one day a man of great credit.


If I be, I Will build Chimnies with Tobacco but I Will smoke some: and be sure
Bird. I Will stick wool upon thy back


Thanks sir, I know you will, for all the kindred of the Monopolies are held to
be great Fleecers


So draw those Curtains; and lets see the pictures under ^m.


Welcome to the Stilliard fair Ladies.


Thanks good master Lynstocke.


Hans: some wine Hans.


Yaw, yaw, you sall hebben it mester:
Old vine, or new vine?

Speak women.


New wine good sir Gozlin: wine in the must, good Dutchman, for must is best
for us women


New vine? vell: two pots of new vine.


An honest Butterbox: for if it be old, there is none of it coms into my belly.


Why Tenterhooke pray thee lets dance friskin, and be merry.


Thou art so troubled with Monopolies, they so hang at thy heart stringes.


Pox a my heart then.


I and mine too, if any Courtier of them all set up his gallows there: wench
use him as thou do thy pantables, scorn to let him kiss thy heel, for he
feeds thee with nothing but Court holy bread, good words, and cares not for
thee: sir Gozlin, will you taste a Dutch whatch you callum


Here master Lynstocke, half mine is yours. Bun, Bun, Bun, Bun.


Which room? where are they? woe ho, ho, ho, so, ho boys.


Sfoot whose that? lock our room.


Not till I am in: and then lock out the devil tho he come in the shape of a
puritan


Scholemaister, welcome? welcome in troth?


Who would not be scratcht with the briars and brambles to have such burs
sticking on his breeches: Save you gentlemen: O noble Knight


More wine Hans.


Am not I (gentlemen) a Ferret of the right hair, that can make three Conies
bolt at a clap into your pursenets? ha? little do their 3. husbands dream what
coppies I am setting their wives now? were not a rare Jest if they should come
sneaking upon us like a horrible noise of Fiddlers


Troth I Would not care: let em come: I Would tell em, weed h^ none of their dull
Music


Here mistress Tenterhooke.


Thanks good mistress Wafer.


Whose there? Peepers: Intelligencers: E^esdroppers.


Vds foot, throw a pot ats head?


Oh Lord? O Gentlemen, Knight, Ladies, that may be, Citizens wives that are,
shift for your selves, for a pair of your husbands heads are knocking together
with Hans his, and inquiring for you. Omni. Keep the door locked


Oh I, do, do: and let sir Gozlin (because he has bin in the low Countries)
swear go^z Sacrament, and drive them away with broken Dutch


Here Is a wench has simple Sparks in her: she is my pupile Gallants: Good-god? I
see a man is not sure that his wife is in the Chamber, tho his own fingers
hung on the Padlocke: Trap-doores, false Drabs, and Spring-lockes, may cozen a
Co^y of Constables. How the silly Husbands might here ha been guld with
Flemish money: Come: drink up Rhene, Thames and Meander dry, There Is Nobody


Ah thou ungodly master.


I did but make a false fire, to try your valor, because you cried let em
come. By this glass of woman's wine, I^would not ha seen their Spirits walk
here, to be dubd deputy of a Ward, I, they would ha Chronicled me for a Fox
in a Lambs skin: But come: Is this merry Midsomer night agreed upon? when shall
it be? where shall it be


Why faith to morrow at night.


We Will take a Coach and ride to Ham, or so.


O fie vpont: a Coach? I cannot abide to be iolted.


Yet most of your Citizens wives love iolting?


What say you to B^ack-wall, or Lime-house?


Every room there smells to much of Tar.


Lets to mine host Dogbolts at Brainford then, there you are out of eyes, out
of ears* private rooms, sweet Ly^nen, winking attendance, and what cheer you
will


Content, to Bramford?


I, I, lets go by water, for sir Gozlin I have heard you say you love to go by
water


But wenches, with what pullies shall we slide with some ^lenly excuse, out of
our husbands suspicion, being gone Westward for smelts all night


That's the block now we all stumble at: Wind up that ^^ring well, and all the
consorts in tune


Why then goodman scrape^ it is wound up, I have it. Sir Wafer, thy childs at
nurse, if you that are the men could provide some wise ass that could keep
his countenance


Nay if he be an Ass he will keep his countenance.


I, but I mean, one that could set out his tale with audacity, and say that
the child were sick, and near stagger at it: That last should serve all our
feet


But where will that wise Ass be found now?


I see I Am borne still to draw Dun out ath mire for you: that wise beast will
I be. I Will be that Ass that shall groan under the burden of that abominable
lie. Heaven pardon me, and pray God the infant be not punished fort. Let me see:
I Will break out in some filthy shape like a Thrasher, or a Thatcher, or a
Sowg^lder, or something: and speak dreamingly, and swear how the child pukes,
and eats nothing (as perhaps it does not) and lies at the mercy of God, (as
all children and old^folkes do) and then scholar Wafer, play you your part


Fear not me, for a veny or two?


Where will you meet ith morning?


At some Tavern near the waterside, that's private.


The Greyhound, the Greyhound in Blackfriars, an excellent Randeuous.


Content the Greyhound by eight?


And then you may whip forth two first, and two next, on a sudden, and take
Boat at Bridewell Dock most privately


Beet so: a good place?


I Will go make ready my rusticall properties: let me see scholar hie you home,
for your child shall be sick within this half hour


It Is the vprightest dealing man? Gods my pity, whose yonder?


I Am bold to press my self under the Colors of of your company, hearing
that Gentlewoman was in the room: A word mistress


How now, what says he?


Zounds what she? a Bawd, bith Lord Is It not?


No indeed, sir Gozlin she is a very honest woman, and a Mid-wi^e.


At the Lion in Shoredich? And would he not read it? nor write to me? I Will
poison his Supper


But no words that I bewrayd him.


Gentlemen I must be gone. I cannot stay in faith: pardon me: I Will meet to
morrow: come Nurse, cannot tarry by this element


Mother, you: Grannam drink ere you go. Bird: I am going to a woman's labor,
indeed sir, cannot stay


I hold my life the blacke-beard her husband whissels for her.


A reckoning: Break one, break all.


Here Hans, draw not, I Will draw for all as I Am true knight.


Let him: amongst women this does stand for law, the worthiest man (tho he be
fool) must draw


What book is that sweet heart?


Why the book of bonds that are due to you.


Come, what do you with it? Why do you trouble your self to take care about
my business


Why sir, does not that which concerns you, concern me. You told me Monopoly
had discharged his bond, I find by the book of accounts here, that it is not
canceld. Ear I would suffer such a cheating companion to laugh at me, I Would see
him hanged I* Good sweet heart as ever you loved me, as ever my bed was
pleasing to you, arrest the knave, we were never beholding to him for a pin,
but for eating up our victuals. Good Mouse enter an action against him


In troth love I may do the gentleman much discredit, and besides it may be
other actions may fall very heavy upon him


Hang him, to see the dishonesty of the knave.


O wise, good words: A Courtier, A gentleman.


Why may not a Gentleman be a knave, that were strange in faith: but as I was a
saying, to see the dishonesty of him, that would never come since he received
the money to visit us you know. Master Tenterhook he has hung long upon you.
Master Tenterhooke as I am virtuous you shall arrest him


Why, I know not when he will come to Town.


He Is in town: this night he sups at the Lion in Shoaredich, good husband enter
your action, and make have to the Lion presently, there is an honest fellow
(Sergeant Ambush) will do it in a trice, he never salutes a man in Courtesy,
but he catches him as if he would arrest him. Good heart let Seriant Ambush ly
in wait for him


Well at thy entreaty I will do it. Give me my Cloak there, buy a linck and
meet me at the Counter in Woodstreete; busse me Moll


Why now you love me. I Will go to bed sweet heart.


Do not sleep till I come Moll.


No lamb, baa sheep, if a woman will be free in this intricate laborinth of a
husband, let her marry a man of a melancholy complexion, she shall not be much
troubled with him. By my sooth my Husband has a hand as dry as his brains,
and a breath as strong as six common gardens. Well my husband is gone to arrest
Monopoly. I have dealt with a Sargeant privately, to entreat him, pretending
that he is my Aunts Son, by this means shall I see my young gallant that in
this has played his part. When they owe money in the City once, they deal with
their Lawyers by atturny, follow the Court though the Court do them not the
grace to allow them their dyer. O the wit of a woman when she is put to the
pinch


Come Sergeant Ambush, come yeoman Clutch, yons the Tavern* the Gentleman will
come out presently: thou art resolute


Who I, I carry fire and sword that fight for me, hear, and hear. I know most
of the knaves about London, and most of the Thieves to, I thank God* and good
intelligence


I wonder thou do not turn Broker then.


Pew; I have bin a Broker already; for I was first a Puritan, then a
Banquerout, then a Broker, then a Fencer, and then Sergeant, were not these
Trades would make a man honest? peace the door opes, wheel about yeoman
Clutch


And ear I come to sup in this Tavern again. There Is no more attendance then
in a Iaile, and there had bin a Punk ot two in the company then we should not
have bin rid of the drawers: now were I in an excellent humor to go to a
valting house* I would break down all their Glass-windowes, hew in pieces all
their join stools, tear silk petticotes, ruffle their Periwigges, and spoil
their Painting, O the Gods what I could do: I could undergo fifteen bawds by
this darkness, or if I could meet one of these Varlets that were Pannier ally
on their baks (Sergeants) I would make them scud so fast from me, that they
should think it a shorter way between this and Ludgate, then a condemned
Cu^purse thinks it between Newgate and Tyburne


You are for no action to night.


No I Will to bed.


Am not I drunk now: Implentur veteris bacchi, pi^quisque Tobacco.


Faith we are all heated.


Captain Whirlepoole when wilt come to Court and dine with me?


One of these days Frank, but I Will get me two Gaunlets for ^eare I lose my
fingers in the dishes, their be excellent shauers I hear in the most of your
under offices? I protest I have often come thither, sat down drawn, my knife,
and ear I could say grace all the meat has bin gone. I have risen, and
departed thence as hungry, as ever came Country Atturny from Westminster? Good
night honest Frank, do not swagger with the watch Frank


So now they are gone you may take him.


Sir I arrest you?


Arrest me, at whose suite you varlets?


At master Tenterhookes.


Why you varlets dare you arrest one of the Court.


Come will you be quiet sir?


Pray thee good yeoman call the gentlemen back again. There Is a Gentleman has
carried a hundred pound of mine home with him to his lodging, because I dare not
carry it over the fields, I Will discharge it presently


That's a trick sir, you would procure a reskue.


Catchpole do you see, I will have the hair of your head and beard shaued off
for this, and ear I catch you at Grayes Inn by this light law


Come will you march.


Are you Sergeants Christians? Sir thou look like a good pittyfull
rascal, and thou art a tall man to it seems, thou have backed many a man in
thy time I warrant


I have had many a man by the back sir.


Welsaide in-troth, I love your quality, las it is needful every man should come
by his own* but as God mend m^ gentlemen I have not one cross about me, only
you two. Might not you let a Gentlemen pass out of your hands, and say you
saw him not? Is there not such a kind of mercy in you now and then my
Masters, as I live, if you come to my lodging to morrow morning, I Will give you
five brace of Angels? good yeoman persuade your graduat here: I know some of
you to be honest faithful Drunkards, respect a poor Gentleman in my case


Come, it will not serve your turn, Officers look to him, upon your perril.


Do you hear sir, you see I am in the hands of a couple of Ravens here, as you
are a Gentleman lend me forty shillings, let me not live if I do not pay you
the forfeiture of the whole bond, and never plead Conscience


Not a penny, not a penny: God night sir.


Well, a man ought not to sweat by any thing in the hands of Sergeants but by
silver, and because my pocket is no lawful Justice to Minister any such oath
unto me, I will patiently encounter the Counter. Which is the dearest ward in
Prison Sergeant! the knights ward


No sir, the Masters side.


Well the knight is above the master though his Table be worse furnished: I Will
go thither


Come sir, I must use you kindly the Gentleman's Wife that has arrested you.


I what of her.


She says you are her Antes son.


I, am?


She takes on so pitifully for your Arresting, it was much against her will (good
Gentlewoma^) that this affliction lighted upon you


She has reason, if she respect her poor kindred.


You shall not go to prison.


Honest Sergeant, Conscionable Officer, did I forget my self even now, a vice
that sticks to me always when I am drunk to abuse my best friends: where
did buy this buffe? Let me not live but I Will give thee a good suite of
durance, Will thou take my bond Sergeant? Where Is a Scriuener, a Scriuener good
Yeoman? you shall have my sword and hangers to pay him


Not so Sir: but you shall be prisoner in my house: I do not think but that
your Cousin will visit you there in the morning, and take order for you


Well said; wast not a most treacherous part to arrest a man in the night* and
when he is almost drunk, when he has not his wits about him to remember which
of his friends is in the Subsedy: Come did I abuse you, I recant, you are as
necessary in a city as Tumblers in Norfolk, Sumners in Lancashire, or
Rake-hels in an Army


Buy any small Coal, buy any small Coal.


Collier, Collier?


What say boy.


Ware the Pillory.


O boy the pillory assures many a man that he is no cukold, for how impossible
wear it a man should thrust his head through so small a Loope-ho'e if his
foreheade were brauncht boy


Collier: how came the goose to be put upon you, ha?


I Will tell thee, the Term lying at Winchester in Henry the Thirds days, and
many French Women coming out of the Isle of Wight thither (as it has always
been seen) though the Isle of Wight could not of long time neither in dure
Foxes nor Lawyers. yet it could brook the more dreadful Cockatrice, there were
many Punkes in the Town (as you know our Term is their Term) your Farmers
that would spend but three pence on his ordinary, would lavish half a Crown
on his Leachery: and many men (Calves as they were) would ride in a Farmers
foul boots before breakefast, the commonst sinner had more fluttering about
her, then a fresh punke has when she comes to a Town of Garrison, or to a
university. Captains, Scholars, Seruingmen, Jurors, Clarks, Townsmen, and the
Blacke-guarde used all to one Ordinarye, and most of them were called to a
pitiful reckoning* for before two returns of Michaelmas, Surgeons were full
of business, the care of most secrecy grew as common as Lice in Ireland, or as
scabbes in France. One of my Tribe a Collier carried in his Cart 40. maimed
soldiers to Salsbury, looking as pitifully as Dutchmen first made drunk,
then carried to bee-heading. Every one that met him cried, ware the Goose
Collier, and from that day to this, there is a record to be seen at Croiden, how
that pitiful wa^tage which in deed was virtue in the Collier, that all that
time would carry no Coals, laid this Imputation on all the posterity


You are full of tricks Colliar.


Boy where dwells master Wafer?


Why hear! what would? I am one of his Iuvinals?


Has he not a child at nursse at More-clacke?


Yes, do thou dwell there?


That I do, the Child is wondrous sick: I was wild to acquaint thy master
and Mistress with it


I Will up and tell them presently.


So, if al should fail me, I could turn Collier. O the villainy of this age,
how full of secrecy and silence (contrary to the opinion of the world) have I
ever found most women. I have sat a whole afternoon many times by my wife, and
looked upon her eyes, and felt if her pulses have beat, when I have named a
suspected love, yet all this while have not drawn from her the least scruple
of confession. I have lain awake a thousand nights, thinking she would have
revealed somewhat in her dreams, and when she has begun to speak any thing
in her sleep, I have iog'd he^, and cried I sweet heart. But when will your
love come, or what did he say to thee over the stall? Or what did he do to
thee in the Garden-chamber? Or when will he send to thee any letters, or when
will thou send to him any money, what an idle coxcombe jealousy will make a man.


O my sweet Child, where is the Collier?


Here forsooth.


Run into Bucklers burry for two ounces of Draggon water, so^e Sperma (...) and
Treakle. What is it sick of Coliar? ^ burning Fever


Faith mistress I do not know the infirmity of it: will you buy any small Coal,
say you


Prithee go in and empty them, come be not so impatient.


I, I, I, if you had groand fort as I have done you would have bin more natural.
Take my riding hat, and my kirtle there: I Will away presently


You will not go to night, I am sure.


As I live but I will.


Faith sweet heart I have great business to night, stay til to morrow and I Will go
with you


No sir I will not hinder your business. I see how little you respect the fruits
of your own body. I shall find some body to bear me company


Well, I will defer my business for once, and go with thee.


By this light but you shall not, you shall not hit me in the teeth that I was your
hindrance, will you to Bucklers burry sir


Come you are a fool leave yeur weeping.


You shall not go with me as I live.


Puple.


Exc^llent master.


Admirable Mistress, how happy be our Englishwomen that are not troubled with
Jealous husbands; why your Italians in general are so Sunburned with these
Dog-daies, that your great Lady there thinks her husband loves her not if he
be not ^ealious: what confirms the liberty of our women more in England, then
the Italian Proverb, which says if there were a bridge over the narrow Seas,
all the women in Italy would show their husbands a Million of light pair of
heels, and fly over into England


The time of our meeting? Come?


Seven.


The place.


In Blacke-Friers, there take Water, keep a loofe from the shore, on with
your Masks, up with your sails, and Westward Ho


So.


O the quick apprehension of women, the'ile groape out a man's meaning
presently, well, it rests now that I discover my self in my true shape to these
Gentlewomens husbands: for though I have played the fool a little to beguile
the memory of mine own misfortune, I would not play the knave, though I be
taken for a Banquerout, but indeed as in other things, so in that, the world
is much deceived in me, for I have yet three thousand pounds in the hands of a
sufficient friend, and all my debts discharged. I have received here a letter
from my wife* directed to S^ode, wherein she most repenta^tly entreats my
return, with protestation to give me assured trial of her honesty. I cannot
tell what to think of it, but I will put it to the test, there is a great
strife between beauty, and Chastity, and that which pleases many is neue^
free from ^emtation: as for Jealousy, it makes many Cuckoldes, many fools,
and many banquerouts: It may have abused me and not my wifes honesty: I Will try
it: but first to my secure and do^ing Companion


I beseech you Mistress Tenterhooke,
Before God I Will be sick if you will not be merry.

You are a sweet Beagle.


Come, because I kept from Town a little, let me not live if I did not hear
the sickness was in Town very hot: In troth thy hair is of an excellent color
since I saw it. O those bright tresses like to threads of gold


Lie, and ashes, suffer much in the city for that comparison.


Here Is an honest Gentleman will be here by and by, was borne at Foolham: his
name is Gos^^ng Gloo-worme


I know him, what is he?


He is a Knight: what aild your husband to be so hasty to arrest me.


Shall I speak truly? shall I speak not like a woman.


Why not like a woman.


Because women's tongues are like to c^ocks, if they go too fast they never go
true, it was I that got my husband to arrest thee, I have


I am beholding to you.


For sooth I could not come to the speech of you, I think you may be spoken
with all now


I thank you, I hope you will bail me Cousin?


And yet why should I speak with you, I protest I love my husband


Tush let not any young woman love a man in years too well.


Why? Mono Because heel dye before he can requi^e it.


I have acquainted Wafer and Honysuckle with it, and they allow my wit for it
extremely.


Welcome good mistress Tenterhooke.


Sergeant I must needs have my Cousin go a little Way out of Town with me and to
secure thee, here are two Diamonds, they are worth two hundred pound, keep
them til I return him


Well it is good security.


Do not come in my husbands sight in the mean time


Welcome Gallants.


How now Monopoly Arrested?


O my little Honysuckle art come to visit a Prisoner?


Yes faith as Gentlemen visit Merchants, to fare well, or as Poets young quaint
R^uellers, to laugh at them. Sirrah if I were some foolish Justice, if I would
not beg thy wit never trust me


Why I pray you?


Because it has bin conceald all this while, but come shall we to boat, we are
furnished for attendants as Ladies are, We have our fools, and our Vshers


I thank you Madame, I shall meet your wit in the close one day.


Sir, thou know my husband keeps a Kennell of hounds?


Yes.


Does thy husband love venery?


Venery?


I, hunting, and venery are words of one signification.


Your two husband, and he have made a match to go find a Hare about Busty
Causy


They Will keep an excellent house till we come home again.


O excellent, a Spanish dinner, a Pilcher, and a Dutch supper, butter and
Onions


O thou art a mad wench.


Sergeant carry this ell of Cambrick to mistress Bird. tell her but that it is a
rough tide, and that she fears the water, she should have gone with us


O thou have an excellent wit.


To Boat hay?


Sir Gozlin? I do take it your legs are married.


Why mistress?


They look so thin upon it.


Ever since I measurd with your husband, I have shrunk in the cal^e.


And yet you have a sweet tooth in your head.


O well dealt for the Calves head, you may talk what you will of legs, and
rising in the small, and swelling beneath the garter. But it is certain when lank
thighs brought long stockings out of fashion, the Courtiers Leg, and his
slender tilting staff grew both of a bigness. Come for Brainford


Good morrow mistress Luce: how did you take your rest to night? how does your
good worship like your lodging? what will you have to breakfast


A pox of the Knight that was here last night, he promised to have sent me some
wild foul; he was drunk I Will bestewed else


Why do not you think he will send them?


Hang them: ^^s no more in fashion for them to keep their promises, then it is
for men to pay their debtes. He will lie faster then a Dog tro^s: what a filthy
knocking was at door last night; some puny Inn-a-court-men, I Will hold my
contribution


Yes in troth were they, civil gentlemen without beards, b^t to say the truth,
I did take exceptions at their knocking: took them a side and said to them:
Gentlemen this is not well, that you should come in this habit, Cloakes and
Rapiers, Boots and Spurs, I protest to you, those that be your Ancientes in the
house would have come to my house in their Caps and Gowns, ciuilly, and
modestly. I promise you they might have bin taken for Citizens, but that they
talk more liker fools. Who knocks there? up into your Chamber.


Whose above?


Let me see your face first. O master Honisuckle, why the old party: the old
party


Pew I will not go up to her: no body else?


As I live will you give me some Sack? where is Opportunity.


What do call her?


Her name is Christian, but mistress Luce cannot abide that name, and so she
calls her Oppertunity


Very good, good.


Is It a shilling, bring the rest in Aqua vit^.
Come shals go to Noddy.

I and thou will for half an hour.


Here are the Cards? deal, God send me Dcces and Aces with a Court Card,
and I shall get by it


That can make thee nothing.


Yes if I have a coat Card turn up.


I show four games?


By my troth I must show all and little enough to, six games: play your single
game, I shall double with you anon

Pray you lend me some silver to count my games?
How now is it good Sack?

There Is a gentleman at door would speak with you.


Gods so, I will not be seen by any means.


Into that closet then? What another mufler?


How do thou mistress Birdlime?


Master Tenterhook^ the party is above in the dining Chamber.


Above.


All alone?


Is he gone up? who wast I pray thee?


By this sack I will not tell you I say that yo^ were a contry Gentleman, or a
Citizen that has a young wife, or an Inn of Chauncery Man, should I tell
you? Pardon me; this Sack tastes of Horse flesh, I warrant you the leg of a
dead horse hangs in the But of Sack to keep it quick


I beseech thee good Mistress Birdlime tell me who it was.


O God sir we are sworn to secrecy as well as Surgeons. Come drink to me, and
lets to our game


Who am I?

vnblind me, you are not sir Gozling Glo-worme, for he we^res no Ringes of his
fingers! Master Freeze-leather, O your are George the drawer at the Miter,
pray you vnblinde me, Captain Puckfoist, Master Counterpaine the Lawier,
what the devil mean you, beshrew your heart you have a very dry hand, are you
not mine host Dog-bolt of Brainford, Mistress Birdlyme, master Honysuckle,
Master Wafer


What the last of al your Clients.


O how do thou good Cousin.


I you have many Cosins.


Faith I can name many that I do not know, and suppose I did know them what
then? I will suffer one to keep me in diet, another in apparel; another in
Physic; another to pay my house rent. I am just of the Nature of Alcumy; I will
suffer every plodding fool to spend money upon me, marry none but some
worthy friend to enjoy my more retired and useful faithfulness


Your love, your love.


O I, it is the curse that is laid upon our quallitie, what we gleane from
others we lavish upon some trothlesse welfac'd younger Brother, that Loves us
only for maintenance


Have a good ^earme Luce?


A pox on the Term, and n^w I think o^t, says a gentleman last night let
the pox be in the Town seven year, Westminster never breeds Cob-webs, and
yet it is as catching as the plagu, though not also general, there be a thousand
bragging lackes in* London, that will protest they can wrest comfort from me
when (I swear) not one of them know wheather my palm be moiste or not: In
troth I love thee: You promised me seven Else of Cambrick. Wafer knocks and
enters, Whose that knocks


What, more Sacks to the Myl, I Will to my old retireme^t.

Very well God ^^mercy.


Your good worsh. I think be riding out of town.


Yes believe me, I love to be once a week a horseback, for methinks nothing
sets a man out, better than a Horse


It Is certain, nothing sets a woman out better than a man.


What, is mist. Luce above?


Yes truly.


Not any company with her.


Company? Shall I say to your good worship and not lie, she has had no company
(let me see how long it was since your Worcester. was hear) you w^t to a Butchers
feast at Cuckolds-hauen the next day after Saint Lukes day. Not this fortnight,
in good truth


Alas, good soul.


And why was it? Go to, go to, I think you know better than I* The wench
asks every day when will M. wafer be here: And if Knights ask for her,
she cries out at stayre-hed, As you love my life let em not come up, I Will do my
self vyolence if they enter: Have not you promised her somewhat


Faith, I think she loves me.


Loves: Well, wud you knew what I know, then you wud say somewhat. In good faith
she is very poor, all her gowns are at pawn: she owes me five pound for her
diet, besides 40. sh. I lent her to redeem two half silk Kirtles from the
Brokers, And do you think she needed be in debt thus, if she thought not of
Some^body


Good honest Wench.


Nay in troth, she is now entering into bond for 5. pounds more, the Scriuener
is but new gone up to take ber bond


Come, let her not enter into bond, I Will lend her 5. pound, i will pay the rest of
her debts, Call down the Scriuener


I pray you when he comes down, stand mufled, and I Will tell him you are her
brother


If a man have a good honest wench, that lives wholly to his use, let him not
see her want


O, mist. Luce, mist. Luce, you are the most unfortunate gentlewoman that ever
breathde: your young wild brother came newly out of the Country, he calls me
Bawd, swears I keep a Bawdy house, says his sister is turned whore, and that
he will kill, and slay any man that he finds in her company


What conuayance will you make with mistress Birdlime.


O God let him not come up, it is the swaggringst wild-oats.


I have pacified him somewhat, for I told him, that you were a Scriuener come to
take a band of her, now as you go ^oorth say she might have had so much money if
she had pleased, and say, she is an honest Gentlewoman and al will be well


Enough, farewell good Luce.


Come change your voice, and muffle you.


What trick should this be, I have never a brother, I^e hold my life some
franker customer is come, that she slides him off so smoothly


The Gentlewoman is an honest Gentlewoman as any is in London, and should have
had thrice as much money upon her single bond for the good report I hear of
her


No sir her friends can furnish her with money.


By this light I should know that voice, Wafer, od'sfoote are you the
Gentlewomans Brother


Are your turned a Scriuener Tenterhooke?


I am spoild.


Tricks of mistress Birdlyme by this light.


Hoick Covert, hoick covert, why Gentlemen is this your hunting?


A Consort, what make you here Honysuckle?


Nay what make you two hear, O excellent mistress Bird. thou have more tricks
in thee then a Punke has V^ckles, cosins, Brothers. Sons or Fathers: an
infinite Company


If I did it not to make your good worships merry, never ^el^eue me, I will
drink to your worship a glass of Sack


God save you.


Master Iustiniano welcome from St^ad.


Why Gentlemen I never came there.


Never there ^ where have you bin then?


Mary your daily guest I thank you.

brought you news your child was sick, but the truth is, for ought I know,
the Child is in health, and your wives are gone to make merry at Brainford


By my troth good wenches, they little dream where we are now*


You little dream what gallants are with them.


Gallants with them! I de laugh at that.


Four Gallants by this light, May* Monopoly is one of them.

Would you laugh at that! why do ye laugh at it then, they are there by this
time, I cannot stay to give you more particular intelligence: I have received a
letter from my wife hear, if you will call me at Putney, I Will bear you company


Od'sfoot what a Rogue is Sergeant Ambush, I Will undo him by this light.


I met Sergeant Ambush, and wild him come to this house to you presently, so
Gentlemen I leave you ^ Bawd I have nothing to say to you now; do not think to
much in so dangerous a matter for in women's matters it is more dangerous to stand
long deliberating* then before a battai^e


This fellows poverty has made him an arrant knave.


will your worship drink any Aquavitae?


Apox on your Aquavitae. Monopoly, that my wife urged me to arrest gone to
Brainford.


I am come si^ to know your pleasure.


What has Monopoly paid the money yet?


No sir, but he sent for money.


You have not carried him to the counter, he is at your house still.


O Lord I sir as melancholic etc.


You lie like an arrant varlet, by this candle I laugh at the jest


And yet he is ready to cry.


He Is gone with my wife to Brainford, and there be any Law in England I Will
tickle ye for this


Do your worst, for I have good security and I care not, besides it was his
cousin your wines pleasure that he should go along with her


Hoy day, her cousin, ^el sir, your security.


Why sir two Diamonds here.

O my heart: my wives two Diamonds,
Well, you will go along and instifie this.

That I will sir.


Who am I?


What the Murrion care I who you are, hold off your Fingers, or I Will cut them
with this Diamond


I Will see em in faith,

So, I Will keep these Diamonds tell I have my silk gown, and six else of
Cambricke


By this light you shall not.


No, what do you think you have Fops in hand, sue me for them.


As you respect your credit lets go.


Good Luce as you love me let me have them, it stands upon my Credit, thou
shall have any thing, take my pursse


I will not be crossed in my humor sir.


You are a damned filthy punke, what an unfortunate Rogue was I, that ever I
came into this house


Do not spurn any body in my house you were best.


Well, well.


Excellent Luce, the getting of these two Diamondes mai^ chance to save the
Gentlewomens credit; thou heardst all


O I, and by my troath pittye them, what a filthy Knave was that betrayed them.


One that put me into pitiful fear, master I^stiniano here has laid
lurking like a sheep-biter, and in my knowledge has drawn these gentlewomen
to this misfortune: but I Will down to Queene-hiue, and the Watermen which were
wont to carry you to Lambeth Marsh, shall carry me thither: It may be I may
come before them; I think I shall pray more, what for sear of the water, and
for my good success then I did this tweluemonth


Have you perfumed this Chamber?


Yes my Lord.


The banquet?


It stands ready.


Go, let music
Charm with her excellent voice an awful scilence
Through all this building, that her sphaery soul
May (on the wings of Air) in thousand forms
Inuisibly fly, yet be inioy'd. Away.

Does my Lord mean to Conjure that he draws this strange Characters.


He does: but we shall see neither the Spirit that rises, nor the Circle it
rises in


Twould make our hair stand up an end if we should, come fools come, meddle
not with his matters, Lords may do any thing


This night shall my desires be amply Crowned,
And al those powers, that taste of man in us,
Shall now aspire that point of happiness,
Beyond which, sensual eyes never look, (sweet pleasure!)
Delicious pleasure? Earths Supreamest good,
The spring of blood, tho it dry up our blood.
Rob me of that, (tho to be drunk with pleasure,
As rank excess even in best things is bad;
Turns man into a beast) yet that being gone,
A horse and this (the goodliest shape) al one.
We feed: wear rich attires: and strive to cleave
The stars with Marble Towers, fight battles: Spend
Our blood to buy us names: and in Iron hold
Will we eat roots, to imprison fugitive gold:
But to do thus, what Spell can us excite,
This the strong Magic of our appetite:
To feast which richly, life it self undoes,
Whoo'd not die thus? to see, and then to choose
Why even those that starve in Voluntary wants,
And to advance the mind, keep the flesh poor,
The world Inioying them, they not the world,
Wud they do this, but that they are proud to suck
A sweetness from such sowrenes; let em so,
The torrent of my appetite shall flow
With happier stream. A woman! Oh, the Spirit
And extract of Creation! This, this night,
The Sun shall envy. What cold checks our blood?
Her body is the Chariot of my soul,
Her eyes my bodies light, which if I want,
Life wants, or if possess, I undo her;
Turn her into a devil, whom I adore,
By scorching her with the hot steeme of lust,
It Is but a minutes pleasure: and the sin
Scarce acted is repented. Shun it than:
O he that can Abs^aine, is more than man!
Tush. Resolu'st thou to do ill: be not precize
Who writes of Virtue best, are slaves to vize,
The music sounds all arum to my blood,
What Is bad I follow, yet I see what is good.

Fair! be not doubly maskt: with that and night,
Beauty (like gold) being used becomes more bright.

Will it please your Lordship to ^it, I shall receive small pleasure if I see your
Lordship stand


Witch, hag, what art thou proud damnation?


A Merchants wife.


Fury who raizd thee up, what come thou for!


For a banquet.


I am abused, deluded: Speak what art thou?
Vds death speak, or i will kill thee: in that habit
I looked to find an Angel, but thy face,
Shows thou art a Devil.

My fa^e is as God made it my Lord: I am no devil unless women be devils, but
men find em not so, for they daily hunte for them


What art thou that do cozen me thus?


A Merchants wife I say: Iustinianos wife. She, whom that long burding piece
of yours, I mean that Wicked mother Birdlyme caught for your honor. Why my
Lord, has your Lordshippe forgot how ye courted me last morning


The devil I did.


Kissed me last morning.


Succubus* not thee.


Gave me this Jewel last morning.


Not to thee Harpy.


To me upon mine honesty, swore you would build me a lodging by the Thames
side with a watergate to it: or else take me a lodging in Cole-harbor


I swore so.


Or keep me in a Laborinth as Harry kept Ro^amond where the Minotaure my husband
should not enter


I swear so, but Gypsy not to thee?


To me upon my honor, hard was the siege, which you laid to the Crystal walls
of my chastity, but I held out you know: but because I cannot be too stony
hearted, I yielded my Lord, by this token my Lord (which token lies at my heart
like lead) but by this token my Lord, that this night you should commit that
sin which we al know with me


The^?


Do I look ugly, that you put thee upon me: did I give you my hand to horn
my head, that's to say my husband, and is it com to thee: is my face a filthy^^
face, now it is yours, then when it was his: or have I two faces under one
hoode. I confess I have laid mine eyes in brine, and that may change the
copy. But my Lord I know what I am


A Sorceres^e, thou shall witch mine ears no more,
If thou can pray, doot quickly for thou die.

I can pray but I will not die, thou lie:
My Lord there drops your Lady; And now know,
Thou unseasonable Lecher, I am her husband
Whom thou would make whore, read: she speaks there thus,
Unless I came to her, her hand should free
Her Chastity from blemish, proud I was
Of her brave mind, I came, and seeing what slavery
Poverty, and the frai^tie of her Sex
H^d, and was like to make her Subject to,
I begd that she would die, my suite was granted,
I poisoned her, thy lust there strikes her dead,
Horns feared, plague worse, than sticking on the head.

Oh God thou have undone thy self and me,
None live to match this piece, thou art to bloody,
Yet for her sake, whom I Will embalme with tears,
This Act with her I bury, and to quit
Thy loss of such a Jewel, thou shall share
My living with me, Come embrace.

My Lord.

Vilaine, dambd merciless slave, I Will torture thee
To every ynch of flesh: what ho: help, whose there?
Come hither: here is a murderer, bind him. How now,
What noise is this.

My Lord there are three Citizens face me down, that here is one master
Parenthesis a schoolemaister with your Lordship and desire he may be
forth-comming to em


That borrowed name is mine. Sh^ft for your selves:
Away, shift for your selves; fly, I am taken.

Why should they fly thou Skreech-owle.

I will tell thee,
Those three are partners with me in the murder,
We four commixt the poison, shift for your selves.

Stops mouth, and drag him back: entreat em enter.
O what a conflict feel I in my blood,
I would I were less great to be more good:
You Are welcome, wherefore came you! guard the doors;
When I behold that object, al my senses
Revolt from reason, he that offers flight,
Drops down a Coarse.

a Coarse?

I a coarse, do you scorn to be worms meat more then she?

See Gentlemen, the Italian that does scorn,
Beneath the Moon, no baseness like the horn,
Has powered through all the veins of yon chaste bosom,
Strong poison to preserve it from that plague,
This flesh'y Lord: he doted on my wife,
He would have wrought on her and played on me.
But to pare off these brims, I cut off her,
And guld him with this lie, that you had hands
Dipped in her blood with mine, but this I did,
That his staind age and name might not be hid.
My Act (tho vild) the world shall crown a^ just,
I shall dye eleere, when he lives soyld with lust:
But come: rise Moll. Awake sweet Moll, thou have played
The woman rarely, counterfetted well.

Sure she has nine lives.

See, Lucrece is not slain,
Her eyes which lust called Suns, have their first beams,
And all these fr^ghtments are but idle dreams:
Yet (before Jove) she had her knife prepared
To let his blood forth ere it should run black?
Do not these open cuts now, cool your back?
Methinkes they should: when Vice sees with broad eyes
Her ugly form, she does h^rselfe despise.

Mirror of dames, I look upon thee now,
As men long blind, (having recovered sight)
Amazd: scarce able are to endure the lig^t:
Mine own shame strikes me dumb: hence forth the book
I Will read shall be thy mind, and not thy look.

I would either we were at Braineford to see our wiue^, or our wives here to
see this Pageant


So would I, I stand upon thorns.


The jewels which I gave you: wear: your fortunes,
I Will raise on golden Pillars: fare you well,
Lust in old age like burnt straw, does even choke
The kiudlers, and consumes, in stinking Smoke.

You may follow your Lord by the smoke, Badgers.


If fortune had fauord him, we might have followed you by the horns.


Fortune favors fools, your Lords a wise Lord: So: how now? ha? This is that
makes me fat now, is it not Rats-bane to you Gentlemen, as pap was to Nestor, but
I know the invisible sins of your wives hang at your eye-lides, and that makes
you so heavy headed


If I do take em napping I know what I Will do.


I Will nap some of them.


That villain Monopoly, and that sir Gozlin treads em all.


Wud I might come to that ^reading.


Ha ha, sownd I: come Moll: the book of the siedge of Oftend, writ by one that
dropped in the action, will never sell so well, as a report of the siedge between
this Gr^^e, this wicked elder and ^hy self, an impression of you two, would
away in a May-morning: was it ever heard that such tyrings, were brought away
from a Lord by any wench but thee Moll, without paying, unless the wench
connycatcht him? go thy thy ways: if all the great Turks Concubins were but
like thee, the ten-penny-infidell should never need keep so many geldings to
ney ouerem: come shall this Western voyage hold my hearts


Yes, yes.


Yes, yes: Sfoot you speak as if you had no hearts, and look as if you were
going westward indeed: to see how plain dealing women can pull down men:
Moll you will help us to catch Smelts too


If you be pleased.


Never better since I wore a Smock.


I fear our oars have given us the bag.


Good, I Would laughed at that.


If they have, would where is might give them the Bottle: come march whilst the
women double their files: Married men fee, there is comfort: the Moons up: fore
Don Pha^us, I doubt we shall have a Frost this night, her horns are so sharp:
do you not feel it bite


I do, I Am sure.


But we will sit upon one another skir^^ith Boat, and lie close in straw, like
the hoary Courtier. Set on to Brainford now: where if you meet frail wi^es,
Nere swear against horns, invaine dame Nature strives


Why Chamberlin? will not these Fiddlers be drawn forth? are they not in tune
yet? Or are the Rogues a fraid ath Statute, and dare not travel so far without
a passe-port


What Chamberlin?


Where Is mine host? what Chamberlin.


Anon sir, here sir, at hand sir.


Where Is this noise? what a lousy Towns this? Has Brainford no music int.


They are but rozining sir, and they will scrape themselves into your company
presently


Plague a their Cats guts, and their scraping: do not see women here, and can
wethinkst thou be without a noise then


The troth is sir, one of the poor instruments caught a sore mischance last
night: his most base bridge fell down, and belike they are making a gathering
for the reparations of that


When they come, lets have em with apox.


Well sir, you shall sir.


Stay Chamberlin: where is our knight sir Gozlin? where is sir Gozlin.


Troth sir, my master, and sir Gozlin are guzling: they are dabling together
fathom deep: the Knight has drunk so much Health to the Gentleman yonder, on
his knees, that he has almost lost the use of his legs


O for love, let none of em enter our room, fie.


I wud not have em cast up their accounts here, for more then they mean to be
drunk this tweluemonth


Good Chamberlin keep them and their Helthes out of our company. I warrant
you, their Helthes shall not hu^t you


I, well said: they are none of our giving: let em keep their own quarter: Nay
I told you the man would soake him if he were ten Knights: if he were a Knight
of Gold theyd fetch him over


Out upon him?


There Is a Liefetennant and a Captain amongst em too.


Nay, then look to have some body l^e on the earth fort: Its ordinary for your
Liefe tennant to be drunk with your Captain, and your Capten to cast with
your Knight


Did you never hear how sir Fabian Scarerow (even such another) took me up one
night before my husband being in wine


No indeed, how was it?


But I think I took him down with a witness,


How? Good Tenterhooke.


Nay I Will have all your ear^s take part of it.


Come, on then.


Hevsd to freequent me and my Husband diverse times* And at last comes he out
one morning to my husband, and says, master Tenterhooke says he, I must
trouble you to lend me200. pound about a commodity which I am to deal in, and
what was that comm^dity but his knighthood


So.


Why you shall Master Scarcrow says my good man: So within a little while
after, Master Fabian was created Knight


Created a Knight! that's no good heraldry: you must say dubd.


And why not Created pray.


I well done, put him down ats own weapon.


Not Created, why al things have their being by creation.


Yes by my faith is it.


But to return to my tale.


I mary: mark now.


When he had climbed up this costly ladder of preferment, he disburses the money
back again very honorably: comes home, and was by my husband invited to
supper: There supt with us besides, another Gentleman incident to the Court,
one that had bespoke me of my husband to help me into the banqueting house
and see the reuelling: a young Gentleman, and that wagge (our schoolemaister)
marster Parenthesis, for I remember he said grace, methinks I see him yet, how
he turned up the white a'th eye, when he came to the last Gasp, and that he
was almost past Grace


Nay he can doot.


All supper time, my New-minted knight, made Wine the wagon to his meat, for
it ran down his throat so fast, that before my Chambermaid had taken half
up, he was not scarce able to stand


A general fault at Citizens tables.


And I thinking to play upon him, asked him, Sir Fabian Scarcrow quoth I, what
pretty Gentlewoman will you raise up now to stal her your Lady? but he like a
foul-mouthd man, swore zounds I Will stal never a punke in England. A Lady, there is
two many already: O fie Sir Fabian (quoth I) will you call her that shall be
your wife such an odious name! and then he sets out a throat and swore again
(like a stinking breathd knight as he was) that women were like horse


O filthy knave.


Theyde break over any hedge to change their pasture, the it were worse: Fie
man fie, (says the Gentlewoman.


Very good.


And he bristling up his beard to rail at her too, I cut him over the thumbs
thus: why sir Fabian Searcrow did I incese my husband to lend you so much money
upon your bare word, and do you backbite my friends, and me so our faces! I
thought you had had more perseverance; if you bore a Knightly and a degenerous
mind you would scorn it: you had wont to be more deformable amongst women:
Fie, that you will be so humorsome: here was Nobodie so egregious toward you sir
Fabian! and thus in good sadness, I gave him the best words I could pick out
to make him ashamd of his doings


And how took he this Correction.


Very heavily: for he slept presently vpont: and in the morning was the
sorriest Knight, and I warrant is so to this day, that lives by bread in
England


To fee what wine and women can do, the one makes a man not to have a word to
throw at a Dog, the other makes a man to eat his own words tho they were
never so filthy


I see these Fiddlers cannot build up their bridge, that some Music may come
over us


No faith they are drunk too, what shals do therefore.


Sit up at Cards al night?


That's Serning man's fashion.


Drink burnt wine and Eggs then?


That's an exercise for your sub-burbe wenches.


No no, lets set upon our posset and so march to bed, for I begin to wax light
with having my Natural sleep p^ld^out a mineeies


Agreed: beet so, the sack posset and to bed.


What Chamberlain? I must take a pipe of Tobacco.


Not here, not here, not here.


I Will rather love a man that takes a purse, then him that takes Tobacco.


By my little finger I Will break al your pipes, and burn the Case, and the box
too, and you draw out your stinking smoakeafore me


Prithee good mist^^^ (...), I Will ha done in a trice.


Do you long to have me swoune?


I Will use but half a pipe in troth.


Do you long to see me lie at your feet!


Smell toot: ^i^ perfumed.


Oh God? Oh God? you anger me: you stir my blood: you move me: you make me
spoil a good face with frowning at you: this was ever your fashion, so to
smoke my Husband when you come home, that I could not abide him in mine eye:
he was a moate in it me thought a month after: pray spawle in another room:
fie, fie, fie


Well, well, come, we will for once feed her humor.


Get two rooms off at least if you love us.


Three, three, mai^^er Lynstocke three.


Sfoote we will dance to Norwich, and take it there, if you will stay till we
return again? Heeres a stir, you will ill abide a fiery face, that cannot endure a
smoaky nose


Come lets satisfy our appetite.


And that will be hard for us, but we will do our best.


So: are they departed? What string may we three think that these three
gallants harp upon, by bringing us to this sinful town of Brainford? ha


I know what string they would harp upon, if they could put us into the righ
tune


I know what one of em buz'd in mine ear, till like a These in a Candle, he
made mine ears burn, but I swore to say nothing


I know as verily they hope, and brag one to another, that this night they will
row westward in our husbands whirries, as we hope to be rowd to London to
morrow morning in a pair of oars. But wenches lets be wise, and make Rookes
of them that I warrant are now setting pursenets to conycatch us


Content.


They shall know that Cit^izens wi^es have wit enough to out strip twenty such
guls; tho we are me^^y, lets not be mad: be as wanton as new married wives, as
fantastic and light headed to the eye, as fether-makers, but as pure about
the heart, as if we dwelt amongst em in Black Friars


We Will eat and drink with em.


Oh yes: eat with em as hungetly as soldiers: drink* as if we were Froes:
talk as freely as Iestors, but do as little as misers. Who (like dry Nurses)
have great breasts but give no milk. It were better we should laugh at their
popin-^ayes, then live in fear of their prating tongues: tho we lie all night
out of the City, they shall not find country wenches of us: but since we ha
brought em thus far into a fools Paradise, leave em int: the Jest shall be a
stock to maintain us and our pewfellowes in laughing at christnings, cryings
out, and vpsittings this 12. month: how say you wenches, have I set the Sadle
on the right horse


O twill be excellent.


But how shall we shift em off?


Not as ill debtors do their Creditors (with good words) but as Lawyers do
their Clyents when their ouerthrown, by some new knauish trick: and thus it
shall be: one of us must dislemble to be suddenly very sick


I Will be she.


Nay, tho we can all dissemble well, yet I Will be she: for men are so jealous, or
rather envious of one another happiness (Especially in this out of town
g^ssipings) that he who shall miss his hen, if he be a right Cock ^ndeede,
will watch the other from treading


That's certain, I know that by my self.


And like Esops Dog, unless himself might eat hay, will lie in the manger and
starve: but heel hinder the horse from eating any: besides it will be as good
as a Welsh hook for you to keep out the other at the Staves end: for you may
boldly stand upon this point, that vnle^se every man's heels may be tript up,
you scor^e to play at football


That's certaine^ peace I hear them spitting after their Tobacco.


A chair, a chair, one of you keep as great a coil and calling, and as if
you ran for a midwife: tho'ther hold ^y head: whylst I cut my lace


Passion of me? master Monopoly, master Linstock^ and you be men, help to daw
mistress Tenterhooke: O quickly, quickly, she is sick and taken with an Agony


Sick? How? how now? what is the matter?


Sweet Clare call up thy spirits.


O master Monop^ly, my spirits will not comet a my calling, I am terrible and
Ill: Sure, sure, I Am struck with some wicked planet, for it (...) my very
heart: Oh I feel my self worse and worse


Some burnt Sack for her good wenche^: or possit drink, pox a this Rogue
Chamberlin, one of you call him: how her pulses beat: a draught of Cynamon
water now for her, were better than two Tankerdes out of the Thames: how now?
Ha


Ill, ill, ill, ill, ill.


I Am accursed to spend money in this Town of iniquity: there is no good thing
ever comes out of it: and it stands upon such musty ground, by reason of the
River, that I cannot see how a tender woman can do well int, Sfoot? Sick now?
cast down now it is come to the push


My mind misgiues me that als not sound at London.


Pox on em that be not sound, what need that touch you?


I fear you will never carry me thither.


Puh, puh, say not so.


Pray let my clothes be utterly undone, and then lay me in my bed.


Walk up and down a little.


O master Lynstock, it is no walking will serve my turn: have me to bed good
sweet Mistress Honisuckle, I doubt that old Hag Gillian of Braineford has
bewitched me


Look to her good wenches.


I so we will, and to you too: this was excellent.


This is strange.


Villainous spiteful luck: no matter, th, other two hold ^yas.


Peace, mark how he is nipt: nothing greeues me so much as that poor Pyramus
here must have a wall this night between him and his Thisbe


No remedy trusty Troylus: and it greeues me as much, that you will want your
false Cressida to night, for heeres no sir Pandarus to usher you into your
Chamber


I Will somon a parlee to one of the Wenches, and see how all goes.


No whispring with the common enemy by this Iron: he sees the Devil that sees
how all goes amongst the women to night: Nay Sfoot? If I stand piping till you
dance, damn me


Why you will let me call to em but at the keyhole.


Puh, good master Lynstocke, I Will not stand by whilst you give Fire at your
Key-holes? I Will hold no Trencher till an other ^eedes: no stirrup till another
gets up: be no doore-keeper. I ha not been so often at Court, but I know what
the backside of the Hangings are made of I Will trust none under a piece of
Tapistry, viz. a Couerlet


What will you say if the Wenches do this to gull us?


No matter, I Will not be doubly guld, by them and by you: go, will you take the
lease of the next chamber and do as I do


And what is that?


Any villainy in your company, but nothing out on it will you sit up, or lie
by'te


Nay lie sure, for lying is most in fashion.


Troth then; I Will have you before me.


It shall be youres.


Yours in faith: I Will play Ianus with two faces and look a squinte both ways for
one night


Well Sir, you shall be our dore-keeper.


Since we must swim, lets leap into one flood,
We Will either be all naught, or else all good.

Come, come, come, follow me, follow me. I warrant you ha lost more by not
falling into a sound last night, than ever you got at one Job since it pleased

thrash all the Country together, hedge in the house with Flayles, Pike-staues,

Hamlet; and cry revenge, come, and (...) do so


Pray stay, be not so heady at my entreaty.


My wife (...) you, and I entreat you to have mercy on your (...), though you
have none over the women. I Will tell you a tale: this last Christmas a Citizen
and his wife (as it might be one of you) were invited to the Reuells one night
at one of the (...) a Court: the husband (having business) trusts his wife
thither to take up a room for him before: she did so: but before she went;
doubts a rising, what blocks her husband would stumble at, to hinder his
entrance, It was consulted upon, by what token, by what trick,, by what banner,
or brooch he should be known to be he when he wrapped at the Gate


Very good.


The crowd he was told would be greater, their clamors greater, and able to
droune the throats of a shoule of fish wives: he himself therefore (...) an
excellent watchword, and the sigue at which he would hang out himself, should
be a horn: he would wind his horn, and that should give 'hem warning that he
was come


So.


The torchmen and (...) had an Item to receaiue him: he comes, ringes out his
horn with an allarum, enters with a showte, all the house rises (thinking some
sowgelder pressed in) his wife blushed, the company Iested, the simple man like a
beggar going to the stocks laughed, as not being sencible of his own disgrace,
and hereupon the punyes set down this decre that no man shall hereafter come
to laugh at their reuells (if his wife be entered before him) unless he carry his
horn about hi


I Will not trouble them.


So if you trompet a broad and preach at the market cross, you wives shame,
it is your own shame


What shall we do then!


Take my council, I Will ask no fee sort: bar out host: banish mine hosts,
beat a way the Chamberlin, let the ost^ers walk, enter you the ch^mbers
peaceably, lock the doors gingerly, look upon your wives woefully, but upon
the euill-doers, most wickedly


What shall we reap by this.


An excellent harvest, this, you shall hear the poor
mouse-trapt-guilty-gentlemen call for mercy; your wives you shall see kneelig
at your feet, and weeping, and wringing, and blushing, and cursing Brainford
and crying pardona may pardona may, pardona may, whilst you have the choice to
stand either as Judges to condemn 'hem, beadles to torment 'hem, or confessors
to absolved 'hem: And what a glory will it be for you 3. to kiss your wives
like forgetful husbands, to exhort and forgive the young men like pitiful
fathers; then to call for ^ares, then to cry hay for London, then to make a
Supper, then to drown all in Sack and Sugar, then to go to bed, and then to
rise and open shop, where you may ask any man what he lacks with your cap off,
and none shall perceive whether the brims wring you


We Will raise no towns.


No, no, lets knock first.

What means this.


Have we defied you upon the walls all night to open our gates to you ith
morning. Our honest husbands they (silly me^) lie praying in their beds now,
that the water under us may not be rough, the tilt that couers us may not be

they walk upon Queen-hiue (as Leander did for Hero) to watch for our landing,
and should we wrong such kind hearts? wud we might ever be trobled with the

And then if the female party that is cliented aboue-Staires, be young, She Is a
Squires daughter of low degree, that lies there for physic, or comes up tobe
placed with a Countess: if of middle age, she is a Widow, and has suits at the
term or so


O fie upon her, burn the witch out of our company.


Lets hem her out off Brainford, if she get not the faster to London.


O no, for Gods sake, rather hem her out off London and let her keep in
Brainford still


No you cannot hem me out of London; had I known this your rings should ha bin
poxt er -- I wud ha touched 'hem: I will take a pair of Oars, and leave you


Let that ruin of intemperance be rakt up in dust and ashes, and now tell me,
if you had raised the Town, had not the tiles tumbled upon your heads: for you
see your Wives are chaste, these Gentlemen civil, all is but a merriment, all
but a May Game; she has her Diamonds, you shall have your money the child is
recovered, the false Collier discovered, they came to Brainford to be merry,
you were caught in Bird-lime; and therefore set the Hares-head against the
Goose-giblets, put all instruments in tune, and every husband play music upon
the lips of his Wife whilst I begin first


Come wenches be it so,


Mist. Iustiniano is it you were ashamed all this while of showing your face, is
she your wife Schoolemaister


Look you, your Schoole-maister has bin in France, and lost his hair, no more
Parenthesis now, but Iustiniano, I will now play the Merchant with you. Look
not strange at her, nor at me, the story of us both, shall be as good, as an
old wives tale, to cut off our way to London.


Alas Sir, the Knight yonder Sir Gozlin has almost his throat cut by Powlterers
and Townes-men and rascals, and all the Noise that went with him poor
fellows have their Fidle-cases pulled over their ears


Is Sir Gozlin hurt?


Not much hurt Sir, but he bleedes like a Pig, for his crowne's cracked.


Then has he been twice cut ith head since we landed, once with a
Pottle-po^and now with old iron


Gentlemen hasten to his rescue some, whilst others call for Oars.


Away then to London.


Farewell Brainford.
Gold that buys health, can never be ill spent,
Nor hours laid out in harmless meryment.

Oars, Oars, Oars, Oars:
To London hay, to London hay:
Hoist up sails and lets away,
for the safest bay
For us to land is London shores.
Oars, Oars, Oars, Oars:
Quickly shall we get to Land,
If you, if you, if you,
Lend us but half a hand.
O lend us half a hand.
