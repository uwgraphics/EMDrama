So ill success have Poets now adays,
That shortly none will dare to write you Plays.
Dramatick Wit is ominous of late;
The little Flash does still prognosticate
A Paper-war, or a more scurvie Fate.
And (like a graceless Child) Heroic Rattle
Is realliz'd, and turned the Poets Battle.
To Avoid such fears, we shall present to day
An innocent and unprovoking Play:
And that is his comfort, The Author bid me say.
It Is plain, well meant; hardly a Song or Dance,
Scene, nor Machine, its Credit to advance.
Yo've nothing here of such prodigious strains,
To swell your Envy greater than his Pains.
But being of English growth, we have cause to fear,
Against homebred Wit their censure too severe,
Who still usurp a Power to disapprove
What the sick Fancy cannot digest, or Love.
Persist -- But Letchers thus, when they decline,
Borrow both Heat and Love from sparkling Wine.
And though poor Chloris thinks their Love's her Prize,
It Is Burgundy becomes her Sacrifice.
While healthful Lovers vigorously improve
With Native Food and heat th'Entrigues of Love.

HOnest Ned Goodfeild, in faith I Am as glad to see thee as any man living. Once
more thou art welcome to London. But, what good Star directed thee to my
Chamber


Marry, that did the good Porter: he showed me the Staircase; and when I
mounted, the first I happened to meet was your Boy. Gad, Jack, thou live here
a delicate life; these are better Lodgings than thou had at the College


Aye, faith, and somewhat better Company. But what a Devil makes thee tarry
thus long at Cambridge? Sure thou art graduated up to the Ears by this time.
Do thou intend for the Pulpit, or by the way of Physic, will thou cure thy
friends of all Diseases? --


No more of that, good Jack; I have a Mother alive, who till I come to age (of
which I lack not many weeks) is also my Guardian. She is a good Soul (as Sancho
said of his Wife) but of a downright Country-principle. She hates your City
here, and all that belongs to it. Look ye, Jack; when you left the College, I
would have followed you with all my heart, but my Mother very gravely, and like
a Mother, writ me her Commands, and I think, sent one of her servants to
acquaint me, that I must still continue my Studies where I was: for to come
into the Country, and enter into Commission of the Peace, I was yet too young;
and to go to the Inns a Court she would never think on it, for that was the
ready way to be undone, London being the very sink of all Debauchery


Hold there: Let me view thee well. Do thou come from the University, and
charge us with Debauchery? O tempora! O mores! Belike then you made this Voyage
without your Mothers knowledge


Aye.


Why there is a dutiful Son. Art not thou ashamed, Ned?


For what? for coming to Town without her leave?


No, Ned, for blaming the poor Town, for a lewd ill-manner'd Town, or as your
Mother thinks it, a sink of Perdition. I tell thee, Ned, thou art quite beside
the Cushion. Mind what I say: Your University-men no sooner come hither, but
they forget their dear Art of Drinking. And for a Clap, or so, many are so far
from getting it here, that they bring it with em. -- Boy, see who knocks


Sir, here is Mr. Docket's Clerk has a Message from his Master, he says, and
desires you would please to dispatch him


Dispatch him? why how long has he waited?


Not at all, Sir; but you know he is so full of his Lawterms, he cannot speak
without 'em


Bid him enter.


Mr. Dashwel, you may enter.


Sir, I humbly thank ye. May it please you, Mr. Truman, my Master desires to
speak with you some time this afternoon


How does he do?


Very well, and in good practice, I thank God, Sir.


I Am glad on it. Tell your Master, Sir, I will not fail to wait on him about
three a clock


By no means, Sir, for then he will be very busy in examining a special Plea in
Trover, which will hold him at least half an hour


Why then I Will be with him at five.


That cannot be, Sir, for then he will be gone out to the Walks to meet his
Brother Nuper, and sign Judgment betwixt Wiseman and Spendal: It Is a 2000 l.
Action, and cannot be put off


No? What a Devil -- why then tell him I Will not fail to come as soon as I Have
dined, 'twixt one and two a clock


Aye, Sir, I think that will do very well. Fare you well, Sir.


Godb'w'ye Mr. Dashwel.


Oh Lord! Sir, I had almost forgot; you must not come then, for then there will
be with him a certain Country-Lady, one Madam Goodfeild, who comes about
business; and you must not come then by any means


Madam Goodfeild, say you friend?


Yes, Sir, of Darbyshire.


Do You know her business?


To that, Sir, I answer Ignoramus: I can say little --


To the purpose, I Am sure. --


Her Servant, one Mr. Trupenny, was with my Master this morning, to desire an
Imparlance after Dinner, and then she will open her Case. --


Mr. Dashwel, when shall I come to your Master? be brief.


Even when you please, Sir.


Well then, I Will come a little before three, e're he goes upon his Plea; and
that will be a good time


Aye, Sir, a very good time: Your Servant Sir, your Servant Gentlemen.


My Mother in Town! this amazes me.


Suspend thy wonder a little, Ned; I Will know all if possible, when I go to
Dockets


In the mean time, what a Devil is this Docket, and this formal Coxcomb his
man, that comes with such a damned Message


It Is worth your enquiry indeed, for they are two as notable Creatures as e're
were showed at Bartholomew-Fair. The man you have seen already, and should you
see him a year together, you would see neither more nor less in him; yet people
of his Tribe say he is a good Clerk (as they phrase it.) He Is one that manages
his Masters Practice so assiduously, that he can do nothing else -- But a pox
on him, what do I spend so many words of such an Owl


Then for the Master.


Aye, the Master. There Is a rare plece of flesh for ye -- never was Master and
Man so proportioned to one another. You have heard part of the man's Character
already; and, If the man such dullness have -- you know the old Rhyme in the
Arcadia. To be brief, (for I hate to discourse of such unpleasant subjects) He
is a pure downright Attorney, with as little mixture of Gentleman or Scholar as
possible can be imagined to one who lives in London, the Staple of refined
converse. To this I must add, he is Old and Rich


In The name of Wonder, how came you acquainted with such things as these? Is
this the refined Converse, you talk of


Oh, Ned! thereby hangs a tale. You must know then, in an evil hour, I owe him
6000 l. which my Father heretofore borrowed, partly to marry a Daughter, and
partly on other occasions: For this Debt he mortgaged five hundred a year,
which Mortgage has been now forfeited about four year, and he in the Devils
name, has entered. Since my Father's death, Ned, I have been very sensible of
this loss, it being (betwixt you and I) the best half of my Estate. In fine, I
have been several times with him to take in this Mortgage, and get him to
release the Estate. I have offered him, to that end, to pay down 3000 l. with
the Interest due, and a Judgment from my self and two substantial Citizens, for
the other three


And so he replies that you offer him to his loss, and that he has eleven
Points of the Law against ye; does he not


Much to that purpose; but in his Gibberish, he tells me, Null tort null
disseisin, I must not complain of wrong, he has but what the Law gives him, and
Executio Iuris non habet Injuriam: And this is all I could ever get from him,
till yesterday, and then we were in somewhat more complaisant terms. He sends
for me now, I am confident, about this business


Well, is this all you can tell me of him?


No.


Proceed.


He has a pretty Niece, that I must bring you acquainted with.


Me! Gad Jack, you have made such a fine Character of him, I have no ambition
to know any of the Breed


You mistake me, Ned Goodfeild; she is no ways a kin to the dis-ingenuity of
her Uncle. Believe me, Friend, she is both Young, Pretty, of a good Humor, and
besides a Fortune


And with all these good Qualities, why do not you strike her up, and by that
means pay off your Mortgage


Not so fast: The Affair is less feazable to me than any man, for several
reasons that I know. Her Father dying, left this his only Daughter, and 6000
l. to the management of his Wives Brother, this Docket, who he appointed her
Guardian, with this Proviso in his Will, that if she married without her said
Guardian's consent, then to forfeit the said sum intended for her Portion, and
that her Uncle might dispose of it as he thought fit. Her Uncle, a covetous
Jew, has swallowed all this Estate already in imagination, intending never to
marry her with his consent: To that end, confines her (while with him in
London) constantly to her Chamber, never suffering her to see the open air,
unless once or twice a fortnight in the Temple or Lincolns-Inn-Gardens; and
that too, with himself or some such trusty Governor


These are Impediments, I confess Jack, especially to a Debtor.


This is not all. The damned dull course of life her Uncle has imposed upon
her, has rendered both her discourse and behavior very reserved, or to say
true, a little heavy; which suits not at all with my fancy; for I must have my
Mistress, Ned, full of Air and Gayety to the utmost extent


Faith, then I Have a Sister will fit thee to a hair.


Where is she, Ned?


Ah Pox, she is in Darby-shire.


That Is a great way off. But how do you know she is not come up with your Mother?


Oh, it can never enter into my thoughts: She Will sooner send her to the Nunnery
at Ghent, than bring her hither. She believes this Town spoils all young men
that come to it; but for women, she is confident the very air of London meets
'em, and debauches 'em at Highate. Hang me if I can comprehend what a Devil
brings my Mother her self up: it must be some extraordinary occasion. She has
not made such a Voyage, to my knowledge, this twenty years


Well, we shall know all when I have been at Dockets. In the mean time, Ned,
thou shall dine with me: I Will acquaint thee with the humor of the
Eating-houses. Boy, give me my Sword, and follow me


NOw, Franck, that we are arrived at London, and have luckily taken Lodgings
near my Mother, our first care must be, to conceal our Disguize; to that end,
be sure you never speak to me otherwise than by the name of Sir: 'ware tripping


Leave that to me, Sir; I was the first that thought of this Adventure, and if
I cannot manage it, may I never live to be married, and that is no small Curse.
I Will be so far from betraying the secret in public, that even in private, when
we are alone, you shall pass with me for what you seem


My next endeavors must be, how to suit my own behavior to what I intend, a
Town-Gallant. In this, Franck, you must instruct me, for you have known the
Town before you came to my service


True. First then, have you seen any of our new Plays?


Yes, I have read 'em all as they came out in Print.


Good: that will be a great help. For look ye, Sir, just as some raw Poets
borrow their Scenes from the Fop-company they frequent, in the same manner,
many raw Gallants square their behavior to their Fop-scenes. What else makes
these sort of Phrases so common, Dear heart -- You understand me -- Let me die
-- And all that --


For my own part, I don't know whether people in London talk thus or no; but if
you would have me discourse out of Plays, let me alone


Besides this, you must be sure to be very confident, or if you please,
impudent in all your actions: That Is the prime Rule of Converse


Gad take me, I cannot promise very much in that particular, but I Will endeavor.


Gad take me! Oh, fie, fie, I Am ashamed to hear ye; why that is an Oath for a
Country-Schoolmaster: You must learn to swear more like a Gentleman, or you will
spoil a Gallant


Why prithee, how swears a Gentleman? does not a Cobbler swear as well?


No, Sir, a Cobbler swears at the second hand. To swear like a Gentleman, is to
swear in a new Phrase, and with a full mouth. I know a Lady near the place
where I was born, that never encouraged her Children with Apples or
Sugar-plums, but when they had invented some handsome new Oath, as, By my
Mothers Maidenhead, or, By my Fathers dapple Mare; or rather than none at all,
a Rapper would content her, so that it came in, in a right place, and had a
good Emphasis. I have seen her little Imps of four or five years old swear as
heartily for a Breakfast, as e're I heard our Chaplain pray


But may not a man hope for an indifferent good Behavior without such blunt
downright Profaneness


If you converse only with Ladies, indeed, why you may do pretty well if you
have often, Gad Madam, and, As I hope to live Madam, and the like. But e'faith
Sir, if you have to do with a Coachman or a Mechanic, you must be at it with,
Damn me ye Son of a Tinker, or you will do no good


Why Son of a Tinker?


Oh Sir, that is a new Phrase, and much more significant, than Son of a Whore:
Alas, that is grown so common, as it is become a term of indearment, only to be
used to Friends and Familiars; as what is more usual, than Dear Son of a Whore,
how I love thee! No body's ashamed of Son of a Whore, but a Son of a Tinker is
not company for a Footboy. -- Then young Gentleman, can you Curse well


Faith, Franck, I doubt, not.


Why there is it; yet you may perhaps when you're moved. But above all, have a
care when any one offends you, not to cry A Pox take him, or The Devil take
him, for these are (as I said before) Terms of Friendship. Is there any thing
more ready, than A Pox take thee Jack, where have thou been all this while? and
for the other business, it is so innocent, we use it of our selves; as, The
Devil take me, Sir, that is a good Jest


It Is very true.


Therefore I think a more terrible way of Execration would be to say of your
Enemy, May he never see his Mistriss's Eyes again; or May his Tailor never
trust him: But this, Sir, I leave to your Discretion


These are general Rules fit for all Companies and places. Now for my
particular daily Exercise


That, Sir, must be divided betwixt Drinking --


I Am naught at that Weapon --


Not so good as your Mother, I confess; -- but I say you must spend the day in
Drinking, Gaming, and Wenching: but in this last affair, you must not enter too
far, for a reason that I know


If I do, the Devil's in me. But prithee Frank, how must I spend the morning,
which some call the sober part of the day


Why there is your mistake: The morning is part of the night. A true Gallant
should never wake 'till eleven, nor be dressed 'till twelve at soonest


Then what is to be done in the night?


For the night, Sir, you must be sure never to go home 'till toward one; then
in your way as you go, you must take occasion to beat two or three Watchmen,
and break all the Windows that dare oppose ye


This is something harsh, methinks, for a Learner: then to break windows shows
too much like Confederacy with the Glasiers: and for a Gentleman to correspond
with Mechanics, is, I fancy, very odious


No matter what you fancy. There is, I confess, a milder way of
Night-adventures; and that is, to pass the Watch, give 'em a shilling, abuse
the Constable in clean Language, for which he will thank ye: and instead of
breaking windows, to serenade your Mistress. --


No more. I Will serenade my Mother, this very night. Let it be your care to
provide Music; and for a Song or so, you can perform it as well as any
Shepherdess in London


Leave that to me, Sir: In the mean time look ye who comes yonder, to exercise
your Courtship. 'Foregad, Mrs. Loveal, my old Lady's Woman, the easiest Quarry
in the world to enter a young beginner. Go pick her up, and when you have tired
that humor pretty well, I Will cross the way and meet you full in the mouth, and
so give you occasion to drop her


Sweet Lady, your humble Servant.


O Lord, Sir, I Am in great haste.


Nay, if you are in haste, I can be as hasty as you, and keep pace with ye, I
warrant ye. I cannot in Conscience see such a Delicate, Little, Plump, Pretty,
Young thing, and of such a Ravishing Air, walk the streets alone, as if
disconsolate and forsaken of all mankind: In Faith, Madam, you must not
therefore refuse me both the Honor and Satisfaction to wait on ye


Oh, Sir, excuse me for that: I am but a Servant my self, and have been but now
at the New Exchange to buy my Ladies things, who is new come to Town. I know,
Sir, a Gentleman of your Quality cannot abase your self so much, to love such a
one as I am


Love, my Dear? never talk of that; for I must tell thee, my friend, and so
forth, (as my Cousen Wildbloud has it) I am an exceeding Honourer of course
Linen; it is as proper sometimes in an under Garment, as a course Towel to rub
and scrub me


Pardon me, Sir, I vow you are such an obliging Gentleman -- but I know my Lady
expects me


Never trouble your self; she has other affairs to think on. Look you, sweet
Lady, here is a Tavern hard by, where we may have a very convenient Room, and be
private. And I protest now, I Am so taken with your Discourse and Person, we
cannot part with dry Lips, as they say


Aye, Sir, but if my Lady should think me long. --





Sir, the next Tavern is downwards.





Well, Sir, I am a Stranger in Town, and therefore submit to your better
experience


Frank, where is she?


Sir Thomas Whimsey, your most humble Servant.


Honest Rogue, how do thou? come along with me; I Will tell thee the best Jest.


Darby-shire, and the well-meaning Country-Gentlemen again, if this be not a
pitiful trick: The first man that ever made Love to me in London, serve me
thus; offer me the Wine-tavern, and then run away, without taking his leave
too? Now out upon him: I have been often deceived in my life, but never in so
few words before. Sir Thomas Whimsey quoth a? well, my comfort is, I know no
such Whimseys in the Country. There, if a young man offers Kindness to a young
maid, he will go thorough-stich with it; which does the poor Soul good at
heart. And -- Oh me! it strikes two a clock. Madam I come, I come Madam, I
come, I come


Where Is Dashwel?


At the Office, Sir.


It Is well: Go bid my Niece come hither.


Yes, Sir.


This Niece of mine is much offended at her confinement; but it is no matter:
she is young and handsome, and I am old and wary. If she be known broad, she will
quickly get a Husband, and that will be no small Nuisance to my Estate: For
though her Father devised her and 6000 l. to my tuition, with proviso, that if
she marries without my consent, then to forfeit the said sum; Yet if she
happens to be well married, and without disparagement, what the Chancery may
decree in this Case, I know not


Niece, I have considered of your grievances, which you moved at Dinner; but I
perceive you are young, and do not weigh things with discretion. Should I
suffer ye to go abroad, or let people come to ye, some vain idle fellow with a
white Perriwig and a long Sword, would marry ye, Niece, do you mind me? would
marry ye; and then you're undone. -- Look ye, Niece, Abundans cautela non
nocet, pray observe that


In the mean time, Sir, the continual imprisonment of my Chamber is
insufferable: I Am sure it is very prejudicial to my health; and I Am troubled
with such a Headache, flesh and blood is not able to endure it


Nay, good Lucy, never talk of that, but consider the Maxim; A private damage
is to be suffered, rather than a public inconveniencie. Your distemper
concerns only your self, Niece: But should I see you married to one of those
Fops I told you of but now, it would break my heart. --





Yet because you shall not say I Am made of Marble, and have no consideration of
your Infirmities, look ye, Niece, you and your Maid shall have a turn in the
Temple-Garden this Evening, and there taste the sweet air of the Thames. What
would thou have more, poor thing


Besides, Sir, by reason of this strict life you impose upon me, I have forgot
all the Education my Friends had heretofore given me


You would say, you have lost your Dancing; I understand ye: It Is no matter, a
modest woman should not Dance well. You have not lost your Singing, I Am sure;
yo'are often practicing: yet it were better if you could only sing Psalms


What to do, Sir? you seldom let me go to Church.


It is not necessary: You have good Books at home, read them: There Is The whole
duty of man; think of that, Niece, think of that


So I do, Sir, as much as possible I can; but --


It Is enough. I understand what you would say; but you would have some of these
naughty Plays. Niece, I must tell ye, they are not good for ye, and let that
suffice: Yet ye shall have variety, Niece. Look ye, I Will buy ye the Seven
Champions, and I think, Dashwel has Clark's lives of Famous men; I Will borrow
that of him, and you shall read that too: And for Education, you shall have
enough, Lucy. I scorn it should be said that any of my Blood should want
Education. Dashwel shall teach ye French, he understands Littleton perfectly
well: And if you please, I Will have a Master come and teach ye to cast Account,
and write Shorthand. --


Sir, here is Madam Goodfeild newly light out of her Coach, and coming up stairs.


Away, Niece, here is a Client of Quality coming, and I would not have you seen
in this dress for the world


Is that your Master?


Yes, Madam.


Mr. Docket, I am come now, only to tell you I cannot stay; I must only
acquaint you with my business, and be gone again


First, Madam, let me bid you welcome. Spruce, reach me Pen, Ink, and Paper, to
take instructions


You must know then, good Mr. Docket, that I come to you with Commendations
from my Lady Simple of Darbyshire


Yes, Madam, I know her very well: her Husband, old Sir Simon, late deceased,
was the very first Client I ever had


God bless her good Ladyship, say I, for she is my good Neighbor; but let that
pass: I love few words, Mr. Docket, and those to the purpose. --


My own humor directly. --


You must know then, Mr. Docket, that I have a one and only Daughter in the
Country, her name is Elizabeth Goodfeild, (you may set her down, if you please)
a wild Wench she is, and therefore it is high time to marry her, (but you need
not set that down.) Now, Sir, my good Lady Simple has but one Son, who since
his Fathers death, is Sir Alexander Simple, (pray set him down;) and my Lady
Simple and I considering that it is better to wed over the Mixon, than over the
Moor, as they say in our parts, (but you need not set that down.) Therefore,
Mr. Docket, we two Mothers, like loving Neighbors, have concluded to marry
together


You mean your Children, but I understand ye: Very good.


My Lady Simple, Sir, is very badly handled with the Gout, that is the plain
truth on it; and therefore she cannot travel: And for Sir Alexander, he being the
only Sprig of the Family of the Simples remaining, we were not willing to
venture him to such a naughty Town; he might not only have been spoiled
himself, but done my Daughter no good too. For you know, Mr. Docket, Husband
and Wife are but one flesh


It Is very true, Madam, there is a scurvy Disease here in Town, which many a man
gets, besides the Simples


To conclude, Sir, I am entrusted of all hands, to come to you, as my Lady
Simples Lawyer, to take care with you that my Daughter be well feofft in
something: For the truth is, Mr. Docket, her Father, honest Justice Goodfeild,
before he died, set her a very good Portion, namely 5000 l. which you know
requires a good Jointure


For that, Madam, let me alone; but will you have it by way of Uses, Feoffment,
Bargain and Sale, Lease and Release, Fine and Recovery, or how? The usual way,
is by way of settlement to certain Uses; but then I must know the names of your
Feoffees in trust: And here Madam, there needs no Livery nor Attornment


For my part, I understand not a word you say: but here is your Fee, Mr. Docket;
and I Will send Steven Trupenny --


Sir, here is Mr. Truman, without.


Let him attend, and do you bear him company.


And as I was saying, Sir, I ll send my Steward Stephen Truepenny to ye; he can
draw Bonds and Conditions, and he will acquaint you with the very inside of this
business. In the mean time you see I cannot stay now: I go hence to visit a
Nephew, a Turkey Merchant in the City, with whom I sup; but I shall not fail to
be at my Lodgings within an hour after Sunset, at furthest


Then, Madam, give me leave to wait upon you at your Return, and at the same
time I Will consult with your Steward about this Affair


Sir, you shall be heartily welcome. I have two or three Bottles of Darby
there, which I brought up in my Coach, (for I hate your London-Drink) you will
say when you taste it, it is the best you ever drank. Till then, God be with
you, good Mr. Docket, I shall not fail to be at home


I Will wait on ye to your Coach, Madam.


To one Sir Alexander Simple, say thou?


Yes, Sir.


But is her Daughter in Town?


No; the two young people remain with the old Gouty Lady in the Country.


There Is the Devil. --


But I have better news for you, Sir; Madam Lucia and her Maid have leave to be
in the Temple-Garden this Evening


That Is well.


And her Maid bid me take care to let you know it.


That Is better: I will not fail to meet her.


Whist; not a word more, as you hope to be Knighted.


Mr. Truman, I sent for you, this morning, by my man.


You did Sir, and you see I Am come according to the Summons.


Yo'are welcome. Look ye, Mr. Truman, you and I have often treated about this
Mortgage. I have now considered of it; and you shall know my resolution in few
words. Look ye, Mr. Truman, I will not have you say that Summum jus est Summa
injuria. Therefore mind me, Sir: you know you owe me 6000 l. Principal


Well, Sir.


Besides this, there is above 300 l. due for Interest, and about 200 l. farily
reckoned for Costs which I have been at in outing your Tenants, and recovering
quiet Possession of your Estate; that is 500 l. Now observe me, Mr. Truman, I ll
pay you down 500 l. more upon the Nail; all which Sums amount to 7000 l. And
for this, you shall confirm the Estate to me and my Heirs for ever, with a
General Warranty contra omnes gentes, and pass a Fine of the said Estate, Come
ceo que il ad de son done. And so you and I will continue good friends, Mr.
Truman


So in effect, you will have an Estate of 500 l. a year in the best Lands in
Hartfordshire, all improvable, with 100 Acres of Timber, and all this for 7000
l. And so you and I shall continue good Friends


As any live, I protest.


Never upon these Conditions, I assure ye. Look ye, Mr. Docket, you would have
me confirm the Estate abovesaid, upon the Conditions aforesaid


Aye.


Nay mind me, Sir; you would have me pass a Fine upon the said Estate, with
Warranty to you and your Heirs for ever


Aye.


First the Devil shall have you and your Heirs for ever; observe me, Mr.
Docket. And besides this, I would have ye take notice, and if you think fit, ye
may put down the Memorandum in your Almanac; I will take in my Mortgage within
two days, and that malgre your damned Worship, and all your Confederates in
Hell, do you mind me? And so farewell, Mr. Attorney Docket


Oh, farewell Huff, if you are so impatient.

Go, spend your grease, vain Fop, fret, swell, and vex:
I laugh at idle words, with Currat Lex.

Here Is no appearance of the Game you expect.


No matter: It is yet too early. I confide in my intelligence; my Lawyer's
Clerk never failed me


Is your Correspondent that dull Beast that brought you the Message from his
Master this morning? --


Oh Plague on him, no: Mine is a brisk fellow that has Sense and Ingenuity in
him. All of the Tribe are not like Dashwel and Docket; if they were, here would
be no living among 'em: They would infect the Town worse than the Sickness, or
Pox. -- In the mean time, Ned, you little think what your good Mother comes up
about


Have thou learnt that? prithee tell me --


Not so hasty; the News is not so welcome. You must know then, Mr. Edward, that
your old woman has agreed with another old woman in the Country, to match your
Sister to her Son; and she has now made this Journey to dispatch the
settlements of Marriage, and so forth: So that my Interest in the party
aforesaid, is dwindled to nothing


Do You know the Son's name?


Yes; Sir Alexander Simple --


It Is enough. Remember that I tell ye, Jack, it lies not in the power of Fate
to make up the Match. The old people may please themselves in talking, but it is
the young ones must do in these cases. I know Simple well enough; he has a
large Estate indeed, but is the veriest Coxcomb in ten Counties. And for my
Sister, I am sufficiently assured, she would rather come to London and sell
Oranges, than marry him, of all the Cullies in England. -- But who are these


This is the Lady, Ned, into whose good Graces I must introdue thee. What
think thou of her


She seems a delicate Creature, and full of Sweetness. Let us engage 'em.


I thought I should not stave ye off. Allons. -- Madam Lucia! I know not to
what kind Star I owe this happiness; but to see you here, compleats my joys


Mr. Truman, your Servant. You are always in this strain -- What Gentleman is
that


My very particular Friend. Let me beg you, Madam, to gratify his ambition
with the favor to kiss your fair hand


Being your friend, Sir, he has sufficient merit to commend him to the most
noted Beauty of the Town. You pass too great a Complement on me, I assure ye,
Mr. Truman


Your pardon, Madam. As to be noted, is not always to be a Beauty, so I find,
to be the most noted Beauty, is not to be the Greatest or the best. Witness
your self: it is in your example, Madam, I perceive, that Fame neither speaks
always truth, nor all truths


Nay, Gentlemen, never railly me in this manner: I Would rather you would call me
ugly in plain intelligible expressions, than laugh at my ill face in you fine
Language. My Glass tells me what I am, better than all the Courting Monsieurs
'twixt Ludgate and the Abbey


Oh, Madam, Ladies are no Competent Judges of their own Beauty.


They always value it too much, or too little.


On the other side, Gallants that are always praising their Mistrisses Beauty,
at the same time dispraise their own Wit. It Is to be presumed, their
Commonplace runs all on that Subject and they have no other matter to
discourse of. -- Therefore, if you please, Gentlemen, we'll talk of something
else





Faith, Madam, let us improve the time as well for action as discourse; let us
all to the Park this inviting Evening: My Coach will be ready in three minutes


Mr. Truman, you speak like a stranger to my condition. I am but a Prisoner at
large, and my Fetters reach not farther than this. Garden


All Curses on the damned Geaolor, your Uncle.


Mr. Truman, I have always looked upon you as my friend. -- Alas, I have but
few. --


Madam, this Gentleman and I, have but one heart: Either direct us how to serve
you, or be pleased to submit* to our advice, and I Will secure your Liberty
before to morrow-night, that Devil of an Uncle shall no longer abuse such
Innocence


Observe, Frank; is not that my Brother, so busy with yonder Lady?


Yes I vow, or my eyes are the veriest Liars in London.


What a Devil makes he in Town? he is as great a stranger here as I am. When we
left the Country, was not he at Cambridge


We all thought so: As sure as can be, this is some Mistress. But what is he
that stands with him


He seems much a Gentleman. I Am resolved to make one of the Company: My Brother
can never know me in this Disguise. Have among'e, e'faith. -- Gallants, are ye
for Love alone, Conversation alone, or Love and Conversation together


Why, young Bully?


If ye are for Love alone, I Will leave the Lady to ye, and Bien proface
Messieurs. If ye are for Conversation alone, why then Gentlemen, pray learn to
be civil, and you two go together by your selves; it is rude to stay here, and
over-hear our discourse, when the Lady and I would be private. --


This is the maddest young Raskal I ever saw in my life.


But if ye are for Love and Conversation together, why then, faith, let us
share the blessed Community; here are four men to two women: A good proportion
for Town-Ladies; two to two is only fit for Nuns that have vowed Chastity: But
I hope, Madam, you are not so vain to think of that. --


Away, rude fellow. --


Belike you think your self a man then. Alas, poor thing, thou art below a
kicking; -- but be gone, or --


Not so fast, Sir; be I man or boy, or whatever I am, I would have thee know,
Bully-hec, I am able to give satisfaction to any man in the Bed of Honor. --
No more huffing. If you are minded to speak to me By the way of Bilbo (as the
Play has it) I Will answer ye by the way of Dangerfeild. Hark ye --


Nay, never urge me, I swear I will not: it is not handsome to tell Names.


Alas poor Creature, thou do not understand what belongs to a Waiting-Damsel;
it is part of her office to discover her Lady's Secrets. I perceive by this,
thou art but a Callow-maid -- and of my Conscience a Virigin


A Virgin? Aye, a pure one.


Fie, fie, Sweetheart, learn more behavior; though perhaps, you are such, you
should not acknowledge it. Should you talk thus before Company, you would be laughed
at for being so out of the Mode. A Maidenhead of this bigness? out upon it


Now, fie upon you; you are the strangest man, I ever talked with.


-- And without Seconds; if you fail, I Will post ye for a Coward: I know your
name; Goodfeild


Spare your provocations. I Will meet thee, though thou were the Devil in the
shape of a Boy: as thou may be for ought I know, by thy intelligence


Well, Sir, now you and I have agreed, I am your very humble Servant. In the
next place, I must borrow a few words of your friend that stands yonder, so
like a civil Gentleman, and has not a word to say for himself


With me? What would the Child have with me? Come, speak thy mind quickly,
little fellow, thou feast I am engaged


You would say, with Monsieur Palamede, that T'are a man of business: Yes, no
doubt on it. I suppose; sweet Sir, you are one of those hard Students, whose
delight is continually to affront Littleton and the Law, by writing Farce, to
be laughed at by the Player-women en Chivalier; or else en Debauche to hussah
for a Wench, be perpetually drunk, and break your friends windows that go to
bed before ye


So: And this you suppose my Character?


Yes: with only this Addition: Yo'are a man of a very excellent temper, you are
not easily provoked neither to Anger nor Raillery. Come, shall I answer for
you? As sure as can be, you either would or should say, Sweet young Gentleman,
or Sweet Sir, or Plain Sir, or something to that purpose; You see I have been
lately discoursing with a Lady, and as I hope to breathe now, she has drawn me
so dry, and all that -- I have not Language enough left me to say, Your
Servant, Sir. -- Come, Sir, confess ingenuously, would you not have said thus,
if you could


Said thus; quoth a? why thou say so fast, thou wou't not let me say a word
in thy presence. -- What a Devil art thou? whence come thou? thou art the
pertest little thing I ever met with


Perhaps, Sir, I have wronged ye, and ye are a Wit. For (as the Play says) All
Wits have their failings, and have the fortune to be thought Fools one in their
lives; and who knows but this is your critical minute


So, so; thou art a very forward stripling, and do begin betimes to be bolder
than welcome. Thou may thank thy Childhood for this Liberty: If thou were a
man, I should talk to thee in another Dialect


Then it seems, Sir, you can talk to a man, though not to a boy: but can you
talk to a woman? Suppose me a woman a little, though As arrant a Fruit-woman as
any is in Rome; de grace Monsieur, how would you behave your self


Away, Boy; if thou have any business with me, dispatch it: Time's precious,
and I can waste no more


Nay, never mince the matter. If I were a woman, I know what you would do. First of
all, you would pelt me with two or three little pretty deux yeux: Then off goes the
Hat, thus, and out comes the Comb, thus; and after having friskt over the
bottom of your Perriwig a little, and exalted the foretop thus, you would make
Love according to the latest (...), thus -- Sweet Lady, you have here a man to
your mind: For to confess the truth to you, I can but counterfeit Love to try
you. Gad, Madam, I never yet could love any woman: and since I have seen you,
and I do not, I am certain now I shall escape for ever


Why thou art a very impudent fellow to talk of things so much above thee.
Alas, poor child! thou do not understand what belongs to Love, nor will not
these seven years


Forbear such frightful words; I am not so young, wise Sir, (...) I understand
what Love is. It Is the seducer of Virtue, the disturber of Quiet, the madness
of Youth, the dotage of old Age, the enemy to good Humor, and, as the Play
says very well, The reason of all unreasonable Actions


And is this all you know of Love?


No: Love was thus from the beginning; our Grandfathers know as much as this.
In our Age the face of Love is very much altered. Our Gallants have wisely
considered Love has been made so common, trite, and out of fashion, that,
though there is something belonging to the thing that is very useful and much
affected, yet the damned Name is hateful; and both Sexes have agreed, though
their designs be never so sensual, to disown the scandal of Love, and call it
Gallantry, Mirth; and Raillery. Love, out upon it! it is got into all places,
though never so improper and abusrd. Have ye not Love in a Maze, Love in a Tub,
Love in a Wood, nay, Love in a Nunnery and Love in a Pipkin


Hold a little, I thou everlasting Talker; I think I must stop thy mouth: Let
me view thee well; things of thy age, are not usually thus witty. I begin to
love thy humor. --


Then, Woe. woe to poor Benito, I sinde my abundance of Wit has ruined me. Dare
you name Love, when yo've heard me declare so much against it? Farewell, Sir --
( Is going, but turns again. Yet if you have Courage enough to be Loves
Champion, I desie you upon it; and will attend you to morrow-morning at five,
near Lambs-Conduit, if you dare meet me


I dare.


Adieu then, Iusque a revoir.


Nay, but one word more; stay a little --


Not a moment: I never talk with Enemies. Your are engaged: Look, your company
expects you. -- Come Frank


What have thou been doing all this while, Jack, with that Boy?


It Is a witty Impertinent, and Raillies well. -- But how go affairs with you?
what have you resolved on


Faith, we are not come to Resolutions, but so far from that point, that this
Lady is pleased to refuse whatever I propose. She is too much her own enemy,
and too great a friend to something that looks like Honor, to admit us to
serve her


Excuse me, Sir, you have obliged me much in such generous offers, but I have
many Reasons not to use 'em. Mr. Truman, you are best acquainted with my
condition, and therefore can best judge of what I tell ye. Should I leave my
Uncle, (though his usage is both unhandsome, and unnatural) I shall not only
loose my Fortune, for my Father has committed both me and it to his
Arbitration. --


Madam, I value not your Fortune, I am already Master of so liberal an Estate,
I care not to increase it. If you please to make me happy in your person, I Will
venture loosing, what your Uncle covets


That, Sir, is the least of all my thoughts: And had I not, that to think on,
yet I can never consent to leave so near a Relation, to whose Government my
dying Father gave me, without, not only his Consent, but Knowledge: And that
too, with two young men. This, Gentlemen, (although I do not question in the
least your Honor) is so very scandalous, I never can admit it


Your Uncle has justly forfeited his Trust, abusing it: and, Madam, you may
well be confident your Father never fancied him for such a Guardian, when he
first named him yours


Sir, I not doubt it. And though I sigh for death or a more pleasing life, --
yet I had rather ever continue thus wretched as I am, than be made happy, by
any means that gives the least offense or prejudice to the spotless Fame of an
innocent Maid


In the mean time, Madam, will you make me so happy as to let me hope I may
hereafter be admitted to your service when you shall be a more absolute Mistress
of your self, and free from the constraint of such a Guardian


Provided, Sir, you use no violent means to accomplish such a freedom. I am not
so ungrateful to forget a friendship, nor yet so dull as not to apprehend who
has obliged me. -- But Gentlemen, no more. -- You must not know me: This is one
of my Uncle's Spies


Mistress Lucia, my Master desires to be recommended to you, and has sent me to
conduct you home; he and I are just going forth about business, and he desires
to see your Ingress before our Egress


So: Have ye any other Commendations from your Master?


Non sum Informatus: That is to say, in English, He gave me no farther
Instructions


Then come along.


Mr. Dashwel, your humble Servant: Pray, Sir, quota cloka?


Sweet Sir, I think it is near octa hora: Your Servant Gentlemen.


Farewell Cods-head.


Now, Ned, what do thou think of this Lady?


I think so well of her, that I think the worse of thee for bringing me
acquainted with her to no purpose


Why to no purpose?


You see she admits not my Addresses.


Thou art a Fool, Ned; and though thou have studied so long at the University,
thou art very illiterate in Women. Why all her discourse was nothing but I will
and I will not: and when they are once arrived at that, they need but little
Courting


I perceive thou art very learned in this sort of Philosophy, Jack: I think I
had best get thee to read to me


Read, quoth a? no faith it needs not, I have it all by heart. In the first
place, you must know, Friend mine, Women are not now so dull, and
unapprehensive, as in former Ages: For just as times and seasons change, so
Behavior grows more polite; of which, the particular we discourse of, is one
of the chief Examples. Anciently Girls had such a gross Education, that most of
them knew neither to read, Bawdry; nor write, Assignations; their Parents not
caring to improve their judgment to be more capable than to distinguish betwixt
their Husbands Doublet and Breeches; which not only made them ashamed to demand
what most they wanted, but also when they had occasion to do so, or so, -- Gad,
they durst not, though one and twenty years old, without their Mothers leave


But in this Age --


Aye, Ned, in this Age they begin to refine their Behavior, and have found out
the way of speaking, and yet not say a word


How Jack? to speak, and not say a word? that is a xsstrong Line.


No matter, Ned, you have used to such at the place from whence you come. I
say, they can speak their mind, and yet not say a word. And besides this, when
they speak, they have invented such a delicate Language, that they will talk
with you an hour together, and all the while discover a sense quite different
from their words. The advantages they have acquired from Habits and Dress, to
supply the defects of Nature in spite of mankind, I Will omit


Aye, prithee do: It Is a Subject only proper to Tailors and Tyre-women.


By the way, Ned, I must tell thee, I am of opinion, the Mystery of Dress is
now arrived to its utmost perfection; and must of necessity, like the Roman
Empire, decay in after-Ages


Thou talk high, Jack.


Not so high as the Ladies Toors. I tell thee, Ned Goodfeild, it is a frightful
thing to see some women, that pass for Beauties in due time and place,
undressed: I do not mean naked; but only their face without the Toor, Shades,
Locks, Hollows, Bullies, and some transitory Patches


But to let all this pass for this time. You observed the young fellow was here
but now


Aye, what is the matter?


Is he not some little Bully here about Fleetstreet?


No: I know 'em all, but never saw his eyes before: But why all these inquiries?


Nothing; but the little Wasp has challenged me, and I Am to meet him to
morrow-morning at four, in Redlyon-fields


Why this is the maddest Rogue I e're heard of. He has challenged me too, to be
at five, near Lambs-Canduit. Belike, Ned, he makes nothing of thee; he has done
thy business in imagination, and has chosen me for a second course to
Breakfast. Two Duels in a morning are pretty fair, for such a young beginner


I rather think he will meet neither on's. I fancy he neither looked nor spoke
like a Fighter. However, I Will not venture the disgrace of failing in such an
occasion. I Am resolved to observe the place and time appointed


And I. It Is possible the Encounter may be pleasanter than we imagine. I am
much of thy opinion, Ned: He did not at all behave himself like a Killer of
men. --


But hark ye, Jack, you must not be seen with me, for I Am to meet without
Seconds


No fear of that: I have another field appointed, at sufficient distance.


Come, let us go find out some Company and be merry. This Garden is unpleasant,
now the Lady's gone


BE pleased, Sir, to repose a while in the Dining Room: I expect my Lady's
Return every minute


Well said: But hark ye, Youth, is Mr. Trupenny about the house?


Yes, Sir, he is a writing above in his Chamber.


Prithee, Sweetheart, tell him here is one Docket desires to see him.


Yes, Sir.


Do You hear, Young man? Mr. Docket of Cliffords-Inn: You must ever give things
their due Addition


Well, Sir.


Have thou brought thy Inkhorn with thee, Tom?


Yes, yes, Sir, vouz avez the Inkhorn, look ye, Sir, but -- alas, I Have forgot
my Almanac


No matter, man, if thou have any Paper about thee?


O Lord, Sir, I put a whole Quire of Copying-paper in my Pocket, and here is two
Quills --


Nay, perhaps we may have no occasion to use 'em.


But you know, Sir, it is good to be sure. -- Look ye, Sir, here comes Mr.
Trupenny. I vow he looks like a very understanding man, and one that can do
business: I wonder whether he can write Court-hand


Mr. Trupenny, your Servant.


Your most humble Servant, good Mr. Docket; I am heartily glad to see ye at our
Quarters: And I vow you're very welcome, as I may say


Sir, I thank you. Here Is I and my man Dashwel are come to wait upon your Lady,
about a little Concern of hers; I suppose, Sir, you're no stranger to it


No, Sir; my Lady ordered me to draw up the particulars of Sir Alexander
Simple's Estate, which are to pass into my young Mistress Betty's Jointure. I
have been at it e're since she went out; and here it is in Writing: Look ye,
Sir, mine is but an indifferent Hand


Good enough, Mr. Trupenny, good enough. Let me see; here is the Manor of --
uh; and the Manor of -- uh; with the Advouson appurtenant -- Appendant you
mean; but I understand ye. Then here is 600 Acres of Pasture, and 400 Acres of
Meadow -- O fie, that must not be, you must always put Pratum before Pastura:
Remember the old Verse as long as you live, and you will never do amiss:
Messuagium, Toftum, etc. Dashwel shall gi't you in writing


Yes, Sir, with all my heart.


I thank ye most kindly, good Sir; I Will do as much for you at any time.


Then here is -- All, and all manner of Commons thereunto belonging, In quodam
look vocate be peak juxta Podex Diaboli, anglice the Devil's Britch. -- Well,
Sir I understand ye: I Will even take these parcels home with me, and put 'em
into due order, and so we'll proceed. I suppose, Mr. Trupenny, you will submit to
me, as for Form and false Latin


I Sir, and reason good. Form and false Latin, Mr. Docket? why, if it had not
been for that, we need not ha'come to London. Our Curate might a made the
Jointure well enough, but only for Form and false Latin


Mr. Trupenny, pray will you instruct me in one thing?


With all my heart, Sir, if I can: But it is a likely matter that I should
instruct your Wordship in any thing, that have been bred all your lifetime at
the Inns of Chancery


O Sir, you are pleased to say so. But pray, Mr. Trupenny, what was Justice
Goodfeilds Christen-name


Anthony, Sir; and I vow to ye, Mr. Docket, it was great pity it was not Sir
Anthony: For though he was but a Justice of Peace and Coram, so that he could a
brought Rogues Coram nobis at any time, yet he might a been a Knight, and a
good one, both for his Estate and Wit


Indeed?


Sir, Let me tell ye; There is my young Master Edward, who is now at Cambridge,
God bless him, and send him well at age, for he lacks not much now. Mr. Docket,
he will have about a three months hence, 800 a year, good Rents; and after his
Mothers death, 600 a year more, which is her Jointure


Dashwel, what think ye, if I strike in with this Widow, ha, Tom?


Innuendo Widow Goodfeild, Sir? I protest that would be excellent.


I have the value of all their Estate to a penny, in my books at home. Besides
this, their Tenants are able men, and special Paymasters; and indeed, my Lady
does oblige 'em to it: For every Christmas she calls 'em all to dinner at the
Hall: Then have we the Bagpipes, and are so passing merry. -- But look ye, Sir,
here comes my Lady her self: I knew she could not tarry long out, after Sunset


O. Mr. Docket, you are welcome. I doubt I Have made you expect me too long -- But
I protest now, I Have had such a life since I saw you; I Will go no more into the
City an God 'ill


Why, I pray, Madam?


Aw Lord, Sir, there is such doings -- Here Loveal, take my Scarf -- And then,
Sir, there are such Cruel noises, all along the streets as you go, I dare say,
it would make ones heart ache to hear'em. There was a woman, and she cried old
Stockins, and ends a Gold and Silver; and a little further I met a fellow
crying old Shoos and Brooms. For my part, I could not ha'thought that old thing
had been worth whistling for in this Town, where there is so much Pride and
Ranting. -- Come, Mr. Docket, pray take a feat by me here. -- But that which
will never out of my head, no I shall carry it to my grave wi'me, was somebody
that stood just behind my Coach, and cried -- what was it Loveal


Mackerel, Madam.


Aye, Mackerel. Mr. Docket, if you will believe me, it made so hideous a Din,
it frighted me out of my place full upon Loveal that fate over against me; and
had it not been a great mercy, I had broke her face


Pray, Madam, were you never in Town before?


Yes, Sir, once; but I was very young then. It was when I was new married to
Squire Goodfeild: he brought me up to see the Fashion, and have a new Gown
made, and so we went down again. But to proceed, Sir, beside the noises, here
are such ugly smells in every corner -- O, Loveal, did you observe the fine
Gentlewoman that light out of the Coach with the Gentleman at the end of the
long street, as we turned down the narrow lane by the new Church


Do You mean her, Madam, with the great black Toor, and face all spotted, with
the Flowr'd-sattin Petticoat laced up almost as high as --


Aye, aye, she: I warrant she is naught -- But as I was saying, Mr. Docket, your
smells, here in London, are most wickedly bad: I have been told, the occasion
is your Sea-coal; but I rather think it is the sins of your naughty City, that
makes it stink above ground. Had not you Londoners better come down to
Darbyshire and fetch of our Coal from the Pits, which is (though I say it) a
delicate Fuel, and almost as sweet as green Ash


Indeed, Madam, the Town is offensive to most strangers, in these cases; but if
you were to be demorant here a while, that is, to live among us, you would
quickly be familiar with these things, which otherwise are troublesome to one
that Discontinues the Visinage


Oh, Mr. Docket, never talk of that; I would not live in London, to be Lady
Mayoress, -- But now I think on it, ha'you done any thing in my Daughters
business yet


Yes, Madam, Mr. Trupenny has gi'n me sufficient Instructions for the
Conveyance, before your Ladyship made your Entry


I Am glad on it with all my heart; there is so much time saved. Now have we
nothing to do, but to be merry -- Steven -- Mr. Docket, gi'me your hand: I vow
yo'are heartily welcome. Come, Sir, you shall taste a glass of our Country-ale,
famous all over England -- Come, Boy, fill out -- observe how it flowers and
sparkles: They talk of Canary, but there is no Canary in England like it. Well,
I say nothing: the proof of the Pudding's in the eating -- Sir, my Service to
ye, remembering my good Lady Simple, and all our Friends in Darbyshire


With all my heart, Madam.


Come, Sir, You and I Will go into the next Room, where I can entertain ye with
more liberty


Aye, with all my heart; I vow I Am under Coverture, as 'twere, while in my
Masters presence


Here, Boy, fill -- I protest I had all sorts of your London-Wine at Supper to
night, and it has lain something heavy at my stomach; but this glass of Ale has
done me as much good as a cup of Aqua Mirabilis. -- Give it Mr. Docket


Mr. Trupenny, here is to ye -- My Lady Simple's good Health.


Come, Steven, sit down and drink with us. -- Mr. Docket, I hate to keep
overmuch state with my Steward: There is a time when Ladies may be familiar
with their Servants, an they were never so high and haughty


It Is very true, Madam.


Aye, Aye, haughty looks must be humbled sometimes, as well as others. -- Mr.
Docket, do you take any Tobacco


Yes, Madam; but I fear the smell may be a Nocument to you.


What do you mean by that, Sir?


Madam, I mean, it may be a Nuisance to ye; that is, it may offend ye.


Oh, not at all, Sir: nay, you shall see I can bear you company. Boy, fetch
some Pipes and a Light; I have my Box about me. For my part, Mr. Docket, I Will
tell ye truly, I was advised to it three or four years ago, for a certain
infirmity; and indeed I have continued it ever since, and find a great deal of
good by it. It comforts the Stomach, warms the Heart, and cheers the Brain: And
then for Rheum, it is an excellent drier


Nay, Madam, here are women in Town that take Tobacco.


I but they run into a corner to do it, as if they were a going to be naught --
Steven, fill me a Pipe -- For my part, I am downright honest: I hate
dissimulation. Come, come, there is no shame to take it: it is neither sinful,
nor unlawful. I say, let your women in London be ashamed to take other things,
and 'twould be better for 'em -- But, Mr. Docket, you don't tell me how you
like my Ale


It Is excellent Drink indeed, Madam.


Has it not a rare Farewell with it? Nay, it is brewed in my own house, and I see
to the working it my self: I put nine Strike to the Hogshead, I prorest --


And as good Malt as any in the Country; though I say it: and that is a bold
word


Come, the other Glass, and then we'll taste our Tobacco -- pray, Sir, make use
of my Box -- Where stands the Ale? Fie, Steven, do you let your Drink die in
your hands? put it about, man, put it about


Madam, my Service to ye.


Well said. Mr. Docket, have at ye: Whose Health shall this be?


Madam, I seldom use to drink Healths.


O, Sir, two or three will do ye no harm, in a civil way, I Will secure ye --
Come, God bless his Majesty -- ( drinks) here, boy, fill


Gently, good Youth. -- Mr. Trupenny, his Majesty's Health to ye.


You have, Sir: Now gi't Trupenny, and reach the Candle. -- Come, Sir -- light
your Pipe -- Docket -- this is a Pipe of -- good -- Tobacco -- It Is. the very
best sort of -- Virginia -- and that is better -- than Spanish -- ( Trupenny,
lend me your stopper) -- what think ye, Mr. Docket


Indeed, Madam -- I think it -- is very -- excellent -- To -- bacco -- and has
no -- fault -- unless it be -- a little too -- hot in the -- mouth


The better for that, Sir -- but I pray, Mr. -- Docket -- are you -- a married
man? --





Aw Lord, Sir, -- here Truepenny, pick this Pipe; it don't come worth a Rush.
-- I vow, Mr. Docket, you are a very staid Batchelour, and have lived a single
man a long time: but I doubt you have not been honest all this while. -- Boy,
fill a glass of Ale. Come Sir, you shall give me leave to begin your Mistriss's
Health


Ah, Madam!


Here, Trupenny. -- Docket, she must be very deserving Lady for whom you have
waited thus long: And no doubt but you will meet with some virtuous body that
will reward all your patience at the long run, never fear it, Sir. For my part,
I have been a Widow now these eight years and upwards, and yet it is possible I
may marry again before I die: The truth is, I have made no vow against it


Ah, Madam! --


Mr. Docket, your Lady's good health, Sir. Super Naculum.


Sir, I thank ye. -- Now, young man, give it me, and fill it lustily. So; Mr.
Trupenny, with my Lady's leave here, I Will begin to you --


Nay, Mr. Docket, first pledge your Mistriss's Health, before ye begin a new
one. I love fair drinking, and fair dealing with all my heart: For my part, I
cannot dissemble


Why then, Madam, there it is. --


Take the other Pipe?


No, Madam; make a motion to your Ladyship.


To me, Sir? pray what is it?


Why, Madam, nothing but -- Sweetheart, prithee gi'me the other Glass; I Will have
one Health more, and then I Will tell ye. Methinks I begin to be very cheerful.
Ha, ha, ha, I cannot choose but laugh at the Jest: this is called in our Law,
Idemptitate nominis. Ha, ha, ha, -- Madam, here is your Ladyships good Health,
and I with it were a Sea to the bottom; Mr. Trupenny, here is to ye


Sir, you oblige me.


Now, Madam, I Will tell ye. You see, Madam, I Am a Bachelor, and you see withal
that your self are a Widow. Faith, Madam, what think ye, if we two, to save
charges, and the like, should make but one Match on it? You see, Madam, I am
plain


I like ye the better for that, Sir; plain dealing's a Jewel: But alas, alas,
you can never pass this upon me


Why, pray Madam? do you think I don't know what belongs to a Widow?


Do You think I can imagine, Sir, that a man of your practice would ever think
of marrying such a one as I am


Nay, never talk of that: but gi'me your hand on it, Widow. You see the worst
of me. Come, shall it be, I Daniel take thee Mary


Soft Sir, Two words to a Bargain.


Then consult thy Pillow upon it, Widow: You shall find me reasonable.


Indeed, Sir, that is the fittest place where to think of Marriage: But here is
my hand, you shall know more of my mind to morrow. In the mean time, good
night, Sir. Trupenny, wait upon Mr. Docket. Loveal


Nay, nay, here is my man: and besides that, look ye, I am not so drunk, but I
can find the way home: therefore, Mr. Trupenny, you may stay, look ye


O pardon me for that, Sir; indeed I Will wait on ye home: I know what belongs to
breeding


Well then, Widow farewell 'till to morrow. Be sure ye think of me to night,
and think well. If I imagined, do you see, you would think amiss, I Would stay all
night, look ye, and correct your thoughts


No, no, Sir, no fear of that. Good night, good night.


The Lawyer's drunk.


No, not so; only a little fuddled. But this is for the honor of our Country,
wench. An my Lord Mayor were here, and all his Aldermen, I Would serve 'em all so:
It Is for the honor of Darbyshire


Aye, Madam, and for the honor of our Sex too.


True, Wench; what is a clock?


Past eleven, Madam.


O me! it is late: let us hye to bed; I am not used to these late hours.


HEre, Gentlemen, this is the Window. Range your selves here, and strike a
sprightly Air. Frank, the Song I gave ye


Gentlemen, my Lady is but just laid down in her naked Bed; but she remembers
her Respects to ye, and has sent ye here half a Crown. She says, she knows Mr.
Docket has sent ye on to welcome her to Town; and she acknowledges the
Civility. Then, Gentlemen, here is a Shilling more of my good will: My Name's
Loveal, and I am my Lady's Woman. I vow, it is the finest Music I e're heard in
my life, and much better than our Country Harp and Bagpipe: And then the Song
was such a pretty thing, I Would give any thing for a Copy. -- But it is late, and I
cannot stay. Farewell, Gentlemen, and hye ye to bed. Good night to ye all; I wish
ye well home


Nay, but hark ye, Damsel.


She Is gone. -- Ah, Plague! This Widow don't know what belongs to Serenading.


She should ha'come to the Balconey in her Nightgown, and cried, Who Is that
comes at this unseasonable hour to disturb my Quiet? Then I should have
answered in a dying Tone, It Is I, forsooth; and have laid all the blame upon
Love. Then raising my voice, I should a huft, Allons, Widow; let me come in to
ye, hand to fist. Then she thinking I had been drunk, should have replied, (as
another Play has it very well) No, Sir, no, -- I wonder you have the confidence
to ask me, when you were so rude to me the last time. --


But instead of this, she shows her Breeding, to keep her Bed, and never speak
to a Gentleman at all. This is, A-la-mode de pais, Ierny


Did not the Chambriere name one Docket, to whom her Lady ascribes this
Civility


Yes. What a Devil should he be?


I cannot imagine. It Is no matter: Content the Music,


and follow me to my Lodging.


Here, my Masters, here is that will satisfy ye all. Go --

March boldly home, Sirs, without longer staying.
Fear not the Watch, they will spare ye for your playing.

O the little delights that a Lover takes
To tell his dear Phillis how much he despairs;
How great are his Cares,
And how his heart aches!
Now praising, now blaming, now flattering Miss,
While all the fine story not stgnifies this.
Sure Love cannot consist in ill Language and Railing?
To term Miss a Monster for Beauty and Parts,
The thief of men's hearts;
Nay, call her for failing
A Tyrant with all sorts of mischievous Arms,
And make us believe she is a Witch for her Charms.
Much better in my mind, though less like a Poet,
Is plainly to show her, when in a Love-fit,
The meaning of it;
And let her to know it
In such Terms as Nature shall dictate and tell us,
And not like your scribbling Fop-amorous fellows.
LOok ye, Ned; this is the Champain where you are to do Feats: Mine lies a
little lower. But still I see no appearance of our little Duellist. I Will stay a
while with thee, 'till he begins to appear; and then I Will retire, and leave
thee to his mercy


Aye, aye, there is no great danger.


Have thou got a Fighting sword on? 'Sbud, Ned, thou art not mad, to venture
thy life with this


Come, waive this Raillery, and let us talk of something else. -- Did thou
observe yesterday, what havoc the little Rogue made among the Plays


Aye, like Don Quixot among the Romances, for all the world.


Why, his discourse was almost all Dramatick.


True: but I perceived withal, he did it a purpose; and not through any want of
Invention, or defect in his own Genius, as your Country-Squire uses Wit's
Common Wealth, and the Academy of Complements. For, sometimes you should have
him speak his own Sense, and that in very witty Terms too. -- But, e'faith
yonder he comes. I vanish: Farewell, Ned, take heed he hits you not in Tierce,
when it should be in Quart


So, now for my Gamester.


Oh, Sir, are ye here already? Well, I perceive you ride the Fore-horse: Yet
methinks, ye don't look like one prepared for Fighting -- Come, 'faith, what
satisfaction will you give me to take up the Duel


Satisfaction, quoth a? thou talk as if I were in a posture to beg my life.
Soft, Sir, it is not come to that yet


No? why then belike you are resolved to fight? Come, Sir, unbutton.


Stay a little. --


Nay, then I perceive you are one of those that will not rend the Buttons from
your Doublet for any man's pleasure; and with good Sir Nicholas, Your
Conscience will not let you fight in a wrong Cause. I thought so at first


I tell thee, young Sir, thou art much mistaken: Thou shall have fighting
enough -- but first you shall hear me --


Ad autre, ad autre, this Whedle will not pass. I see, you are minded to reverse
the laudable course of the world; and instead of falling from Disputing to
Fighting, you would drill me from Fighting to Disputing; but this must not be
among friends: Therefore, resolve, sweet Sir, either to give me Amend
honorable, or fight. Choose which you please: you see I am reasonable


Oh, very reasonable! -- I protest, it is a shame for a man to engage with such
a little young Thing: and yet, I vow, I think I must be forced to chastize him
when all is done. -- Hark ye, Child, do you know what Amend honorable signifies


Yes, very well. It Is only to confess your offense on your knees, and ask me
pardon, in certain forms proper to that purpose. It Is a French Mode of
satisfaction, and of great use among men of Honor. -- Well then, you are
willing to perform it


Not yet: Hold a little. First let me know how I Have offended ye, and for what I
must ask your pardon


Uds bud, Sir, do you come here only to ask Questions? -- This is not to be
endured: You have wasted my whole stock of Patience; and now you shall find me
as arrant a Lion, as if ye had called my Mistress Son of a Whore. -- Come, Sir,
draw


Must not we uncase then?


It Is no matter; I Will fight you with your Coat on. Of My Conscience, there is no
foul play under it


Nay then, if ye are desperate, have at ye.


So, Sir, to your Guard -- Good. -- I use always, before I begin a Duel, to
throw off my Perriwig. It Is troublesome in fighting.


-- Sister --


-- Brother --


I the name of wonder, what make you at London?


Nay, rather, what make you at London?


And why in this Disguize?


You shall first answer me; By my Virginity you shall. You know what the Play
says, For Decency, the man should offer first


My Tale is quickly told. I grew weary of Cambridge, and came hither to give my
self the Divertisements of the Town. I have been here but three days, and
yesterday my very good friend helped me to a Mistress, with whom I am
desperately in Love. You saw both the parties last night in the Temple-garden


They seem both of much worth. -- But well, Sir, you have, I suppose,
discovered to her de ver great Affecshoon vid which your heart does boil over,
and all that


Yes.


And, She takes it to the death?


Not so: Nor much to the life. I am in the middle Class of Lovers.


So much the better; Extremes are dangerous.


But, to observe the method of Romances, now you have had my Adventure, pray
let us know yours


You shall. But first -- hem.


What Is the matter?


Nothing, nothing.


More tricks still? who is this?


One, out of whose company I never venture my self, as much a man as I am. --
You need not be so strange, Brother, it is my Maid


Old Acquaintance! how do thou? Let Us kiss a little. How do thy Breeches fit
thee? Ha, Wench


Out upon ye, Mr. Goodfeild, you are the strangest man; will ye never leave
your old tricks


Now, Sister, your story.


It Is briefly this: My Mother (like a very dutiful Mother in the mean time) has
lately concluded, without my consent or knowledge, to marry me to Sir Alexander
Simple. (you know the fool.) And now she is come up to perfect the Match here,
as to the Law-part --


All this I know already.


That breeds my wonder. -- But to proceed: You may well suppose I abhorred to
marry such a Coxcomb: 'twas therefore by my Maid's advice, here, I resolved to
follow the old woman, Incognito; I performed it, and by good fortune have got
Lodgings near hers: Here I have means to observe her progress in this Affair,
and take all opportunities to interrupt it. And before I left the Country, I
resolved, if I found the business desperate on my part, I would never see her
again, nor leave London. Then in few days I had acquainted you at Cambridge,
where I was, and the occasion, and submitted my self to your conduct


Well said, my Girl! thou shall loose nothing by my conduct, unless it be thy
Maidenhead, to a good Husband. -- Have not you appointed another Duel this
morning


Something of that nature. Your friend that I saw with you last night, appeared
so much a Gentleman, and I liked his presence so well, I could not forbear
quarrelling with him; or if you had rather have it Stilo recitativo -- E're
since his bright Eyes, my heart did surprise, I could not extinguish the flame


Nay, nay, your Champion expects you yonder at the place appointed; and let me
tell ye, you cannot be more taken with his person, than he is with your Wit and
Raillery. But when he knows you are my Sister, he will be over head and ears in
Love, for he has often heard me speak of ye, and received your Character with
much pleasure. -- Well; you and I have met this morning to fight, and parted
without breathing a vein, or so; but in all probability your second Duel will
have a more bloody conclusion than the first


Madam, Madam, fear nothing; your Brother talks thus only to fright ye.


Fright me? that is a good one, e'faith! no, Frank, I am more a woman than to
fear any thing of that nature


Well, a propos; to loose no more time, and keep neither of ye any longer in
suspense, shall I conduct ye to him


Stay -- were it not better, and more to the honor of our Sex, for you to
fetch him hither


Away, away; are you a man, and stand upon such Effeminate Punctilio's? You see
he has met you half way; and you cannot in honor, but observe the appointed
place of Combat


So, in effect, the Challenge will prove no better than an Assignation.


No matter: it is the pleasanter Encounter; and that sort of single Combat has
less of danger in it


As it may happen, Brother. -- But let that pass. A Sudden thought is sprung
within my breast (as the new Play has it) -- you say he fancies me extremely,
as I am a Boy


Yes.


And withal, he has a very great love for my Name, as I am your Sister in
Darbyshire: I mean, Love by hearsay


It Is very true. --


Enough. Come along; we'll to him immediately: But observe that you do and say
exactly what I tell ye, as we go


Well! thou art so full o'thy Tricks!


Methinks my little Monsieur makes me wait too long: I am almost a weary with
walking for him. Hum. Susppose he has fought Ned Goodfeild in earnest, and so
the Constables have apprehended them in the Fact, and thereupon conveyed'em
both to a certain place. -- Yet it cannot be so, I Am confident; that little
fellow cannot be a Fighter -- and yet what a Devil makes him so tedious? they
might have dispatched it one way or other before this time. I long to see my
young opposite; it is a very witty Rogue; and I know the Duel will prove but a
Wit combat at most -- But these delays are naught for Wit, as well as Love and
Fighting -- Pox on it, the humour's gone over before we draw our Weapons. --
Well, l'll take the other Turn, and then --


Look where he walks yonder, as dull as a Platonic Lover: Is it the thought of
Fighting makes him thus pensive


No, I assure you: he is none of those. -- Jack Truman.


Ned! art thou alive still? -- What! my little Bully too? Now I perceive thou
art a Boy of thy word. I thought thou would ha'proved Recreant


Who, I fall back from my own Challenge? Gad, Sir, you have nothing about ye,
that I Am afraid of


Hark ye, Jack; a word in private. -- Do You observe this little Raskal?


Aye, what is the matter?


Little do you think what was his Affair with me this morning -- he had no
design of fighting


Why, I always thought so. -- He a fighter? who a Devil can fancy, that
Smock-face to look like a Hector


In brief, Jack, he is a young fellow of a good Estate in our Country; I have
often heard of him, but never saw him till now: When he challenged me
yesterday, 'twas only to procure a more private opportunity of discourse; and
now he tells me, he is much a Servant to my Sister, and loves her to the last
point: my Mother knows nothing, but he has made several addresses to her, and
finds she is wholly at my disposal, and will never fancy any one, but who I
commend: And now he comes to open himself to me, and get my good will, as they
say. --


He seems moved at this. I warrant him a thorough-paced-Lover.


This is the way to try him, Wench. --


And so; you have consented?


What a question is there! Have not I engaged my self to thee? -- Thou have
obliged me with a Mistress, Jack Truman; and e'faith I Will fit thy humor with
an other. -- As for the Squire there --


Damn him; does he come hither to disturb my Amors? -- Hark ye,
Country-Gentleman


'Say ye, Sir?


Nay, nay, leave your Grimace, and be serious: I am not disposed to railly. --
I understand you pretend to a young Lady in the Country that is my Mistress.
Look ye, Mister -- you must quit your claim to her, and that quickly too, or I
shall give your little Worship much Correction; do you mind me? much
Correction: for I hate a Rival, and love her extremely


And never saw her in your life? I perceive you are a good Catholic lover, and
have a strong implicit faith. It were a happy time for crooked Virgins, and the
like, if all Matches might be made thus, without Demonstration


These are but idle words: Come, Sir, to the matter. Will ye surrender your
Mistress


How, Sir, surrender? Morblew! do you talk of surrendering, when I come here to
bid you battle? -- Look ye, Sir, there is Mr. Goodfeild on your side, if he
please, and I have here my friend to oppose him; so that we are provided of
Seconds: But I confess I had rather fight ye single


Aye, aye, let it be so. -- But I could wish --


That I would surrender without fighting --


No: that thou were more a man, and then I need not blush at such a little
Conquest


For my part, I Will be ingenious. I confess I have been a servant to your
Mistress; and to tell ye true, I have been very familiar with her: therefore,
look ye, I care not two pins if I do quit her to ye, for once; but I must tell
ye, you will have no such Prize of her. She Is damnably Crooked, and all that:
then she paints like the Devil: she has a Mouth like a Monster: and is blind
of one Eye: her Nose, I confess, is a rich one; but (to be brief) she has the
poorest Presence that e're ye saw in a woman. Then for her Wit and Genius, it is
as defective as her Beauty. -- With such a Match as this is, give ye Joy, Sir


Why, this is not to be endured! I Would rather he had continued still to be my
Rival, than thus blaspheme my Mistress. -- Come, Sir, draw --


Hold, Jack; be thine own Judge whether she lies, or no.


Nay, nay, let him run his Mistress through, and see who will repent it.


Mock me not, friend: can I be so happy to find a Mistress in a Rival? -- Oh,
Madam


Where was now your good Genius to prompt ye? (as you know who says) -- Perhaps
you will say my Brother played that part. -- Come, put up, put up your Weapon,
Sir; you are a little too forward: it is not the Mode to quarrel 'till after
Marriage


Well, Madam, by this fair hand --


No threatenings, I beseech you, Sir. Your great Threatners are ever the least
performers


Are you not much surprised, Jack, at this discovery?


Extremely; but more pleased.


Nay, I my self was as great a stranger to the Intrigue, till this morning. --
Come, you shall know all, as we go


Aye, aye, let us return: Now my Duels are over, I have no more occasion for the
open field


True, Sister: A private apartment is much more proper for what is like to
follow


But as we walk, Madam, how are you pleased I shall treat ye in this disguize?
as a Mistress, or a friend


As a friend, Sir, for life. If you appear too servile while I am in Breeches,
you will encourage me to wear 'em always. --


Here Is my boy -- Honnow, Sirrah, what is the matter?


Sir, this Letter was brought to your Chamber this morning. I have been in
quest of ye at several places, and at last imagined you might be here a walking


Look here, Ned Goodfeild, this comes to me from Spruce, Docket's Clerk; no
doubt it contains intelligence of your Mistress -- read it


Sir, my Master, the Venerable Attorney Mr. Docket, sallies forth this morning
to one Madam Goodfeild, a rich Country-Widow, I mean a Wooing, or perhaps
something more; for if I can apprehend any thing from what I hear, it is
possible it may succeed. He began with her last night in no ill hour, and
(according to a Widows expedition in these affairs) he may meet with his match
this morning. -- But this is not the business of my Letter. If you have any
affairs with Mistress Lucia, you may use your discretion. Be at your Chamber,
and within these few hours you shall receive further assistance fro

Your Servant I. S.




Frank, do thou hear? why, this is he that Loveal mentioned at the window.


Assuredly.


Then have I obliged a poor Lover, and never knew it. No doubt but I have had a
great hand in making this Match


How Is that?


Being minded last night to Gallant my Mother, not dreaming that she had a
Servant, I gave her a Song, and the Fiddles, about twelve: to be short, her
Maid came to the window, and from her Mistress told us, she knew we were Mr.
Docket's Music, and very honestly confessed he had much engaged her; or words to
that purpose


Gad, ye have done well. Did you but know the nature of the beast, you would not
fancy him for a Father-in-Law, of all men living


Oh! what a Coup d'etourdy have I committed?


No more of that: It Is a very happy accident, and will conduce much to our
advantage, for a Reason that I know. -- In the mean time, Ned, we must be
active: It Is a shame that young people should be outstrip'd in their Amors, by
two such old Creatures, that have not known what Love is, and the true ends of
Marriage, these twenty years. Let Us see who shall be married first of all us,
and the Devil take the hindmost. -- I am for this morning


And I.


Nay, nay, though the old folks dote, and are hasty, it would not become us to
do so. Marriage is a serious thing, and should be thought of. Pray let us look a
little before we leap into Wedlock


How now, Sister! did not you commit your self to my conduct this morning? Gad,
I Will not have my Amors put off one minute for ye, an you were my flesh and
blood a thousand times more than ye are


Nay, be not furious, Brother. Ha, ha, ha, I know what is what as well as all
the Brothers in England. For my part, look ye, if it must be so, ye shall find
me civil


Well, Ned, I Will go now about thy Affair: In the mean time I commit my dear
Mistress to thy charge. As we go, I Will appoint where to meet thee with thine,
before the Canonical hour be over


Come, Sister, now I Am at your service, to wait upon you to your Lodgings, and
help to shift ye


Sweet Sir, I have a Maid.


Then I Will shift her.


That you shall not I assure you, Sir; for to shift a Maid, is to make her a woman.


Loveal, what is a clock?


It Is near Eight, Madam.


Come, dress me quickly; for I Am resolved to make a day on it. I protest, Mr.
Docket's Music run in my head all night


They call it Serenading here in London, as the people of the house tell me:
Without doubt it was a sign of great kindness to your Ladyship. Well; I vow,
Madam, I dreamt of him to night, and me thought he was such a fine man; and
performed things so well. -- Oh, Jupiter, that I had but such a Husband, I
could be contented to stay a whole half year longer on that condition


Nay, Wench, I confess he is a well-made man: But methinks I could wish he were
a little younger


O, Madam, never fear that: I warrant he is tough; and though his hair looks now
a little grisled, yet one may easily perceive 'twas black; and that is a hardy
color, and holds out well. -- But did you observe his Nose, Madam


Aye, aye, it is a promising Member. But that which likes me best, was to see
how loving he appeared in his drink last night: He must needs be good
conditioned. -- Well, Loveal, how say thou, had I best encourage his Wooing,
or send him a flat denial? what is thy advice


Advice, Madam? I hope there needs no advice in the matter: if your own flesh
and blood cannot advise ye, you are in a sad condition. For my part, Madam, I Will
tell ye true, if I were under your Ladyships Coats, I Would make no more ado but
send him a comfortable Message, and marry him this very morning


Nay, I know there is seldom any good comes of delaying.


I Am sure, Madam, if you had lost so many Suitors as I have by that means, and
been so often Bob'd as I have been, you would hate a put-off as you hate the Devil


Well said, Wench; nay, nay, I am not much averse to the business: I only felt
you a little, how you were inclined; and since I find you are of my opinion, I
perceive two heads are better than one. -- Prithee, Loveal, call the Boy


Jack -- he is a coming, Madam.


Come hither, Sirrah. Can you go to Mr. Dockets? and come again presently; and
not play at Chuck-farthing by the way


Yes forsooth, Madam.


Yet it is no matter, neither. -- Is Trupenny about the house?


Yes, Madam.


Go, send him to me quickly.


Yes, Madam.


I vow, Madam, our Boy is become very mannerly of late.


Aye, aye, Wench; I hope to get credit by him: and your proud Citizens Wives
shall see that we in the Country can tell how to breed other peoples children,
too, if we are minded. -- But here comes Trupenny. Steven. What, you went home
with Mr. Docket last night


Yes, Madam: And I protest, he kept me with him above an hour, to toss your
Ladyships Health over and over in a quart of Mum


Well, Steven, in my mind your Mum is not comparable to our Darbyshire-Ale: it
has a good Body, indeed, but is nothing so palletable


Kuds niggers, Madam, you say true: it tastes so strong of Beans, of my
conscience they Malt Beans in that Country where they make it, and so put in a
double quantity of Hops, and that is all


Nay, nay, I believe I could tell how to brew Mum, an I had a mind. -- But let
that pass: Come hither, Steven, and mind what I say. I would have ye go
presently to Mr. Dockets -- do you observe


Yes, Madam.


Well: tell him, I sent you to see how he does this morning -- would not that
be best, Loveal


No, Madam, I think 'twou'd be better thus -- tell him, my Lady and I -- do you
observe me, Steven? -- present our Service to him, and would desire him of all
Love --


Aw, Loveal, I doubt that would not be handsome, neither. Therefore, do you
mind me, Steven? only tell him this, I would have him make haste, and put on a
clean Band, and --


Oh, Madam, never talk of a clean Band; he will wear a Cravat to day, sure,
though he never wore one in his life before. Look ye, Steven, mind me; Tell
him thus; First of all knock at the door, and ask if he be within, then ask if
he be stirring; then he will send for you up to his Bedside -- I protest, Madam,
I think ye had better let me go, foro'my Conscience, he will never do the
business handsomely


I war'nt ye, Madam. -- Lord, Mrs. Loveal, do you think your self such a woman
for the business? I hold a Crown, I do it as well as you can for your heart and
blood, or your Mother before ye. --


Well, good Steven, no more words, but make haste; and tell him only this, I
would have him come and speak with me presently, and I shall satisfy him in
the business which he mentioned last night. This is all at present, but run,
good Steven, for fear he be gone out


I shall, Madam.


Hark ye, Steven, tell him, my Lady desires he would bring his man with him
that was here last night


He don't hear. -- But it is no matter; leave that to me; I Will provide thee a
Husband, I warrant thee, Wench


Aye, Madam, you have often said so; but words are wind, and I want something
that is more substantial


Nay, if I say I will, I will; though it cost me a hundred pound. -- Come, put
on my shoos


I Will fetch'em, Madam; they are in the next Room.


No matter: I Will go thither my self, and take one Pipe, and by that time,
perhaps, the party will be come


Sir, what are you pleased shall be done in Mr. Richman's business? the Sheriff
of Essex has returned nulla Bona on the sifa; and to take out a Casa, would be
to little purpose; for I am told, the Defendant cannot be found in rerum
naturum, and some say he is gone to Sea


No matter; let that rest. The Plaintiff han't fee'd me for Expedition this
Term. -- But have you delivered the Declarations in Ejectment yet


What, those in Holborn, Sir?


Yes, in Com. Middlesex.


No, I protest, Sir, not yet.


O fie, Thomas, don't you know the Tenants in Possession are to appear and
defend Crastino Trin? and you no forwarder? -- Away, man, and about it
presently; and as ye go, take the Devonshire Latitats, and seal 'em. But do you
hear, Thomas, be sure ye return within this hour, for I intend then to go
forth; and we must not be both out


It shall be done, Sir.


This Dashwel, is a rare fellow for business: I protest, I have had many
Clerks, but never had the like. Spruce, come hither: Do you observe the
Tallents of your fellow Dashwel


Yes, Sir; they are something long. He cuts his Nails but once a fortnight, and
then observes the Moon precisely


Ye Fool; I mean his gifts, and Qualifications.


Cry ye mercy, Sir, I understand ye now. Indeed, Sir, he writes an excellent
Hand; but his Court is beyond comparison


That Is not all, Spruce, that is not all: He Is one that loves the Law, nay,
doats upon the Law; I mean, the Practick part: and of my conscience he was cut
out for a Practiser in his Mothers belly. He Is one that has found out the
amorous Beauties, and the ravishing Graces of Practice; things that none can
perceive, but such a one as he is. In comparison to these, he hates your Plays,
your Masquerades, your Serenades, your Revellings (except only at Christmas,
and then the good Soul is ravished in the Temple-hall where he drinks small
Beer, and sees'em dance till his belly aches again) but above all things, he
abhors, like a child of the Law, your damned Poetry; with which, Spruce, I
fear you are a little infected


Who I, Sir? God forbid. I vow, I have so great an aversion to Meeter, and all
that, that if you will believe me, I dare not sing Psalms for fear of the worst


Nay, Spruce, there you are again a the other side: I would not have ye think
there is any harm in Robert Wiseman's Psalms, nor in the old Song of Chevie
Chase, but that they may be both used, and very innocently. And more than so, I
believe there are some Volumes of Meeter that are very convenient, and of great
use in a Lawyer's Study, as The Garland of Good will, The furious fight of
Floddon-field, and all Mr. Wither's his Works; all these I believe Dashwel has,
and need not be ashamed of 'em. Nay, I can very well remember, when I first
learnt Court-hand I had all the Ballat of the Two little Children by heart, and
me thought it was so comfortable. But that which ought to be odious to the
understanding of all true Clerks, is your modern Poetry, your new fashion or
modish Poetry, your Play-Poetry, or Dramatick Meeter, your ranting and tearing
Poetry, your Poetry that breaks windows, or, as they themselves call it, your
Heroic Poetry. --


Trupenny, with urgent business from his Lady.


Oh, Sweet Mr. Trupenny! Let me embrace my dear friend: And how does thy good
Lady, ha? I protest, Mr. Trupenny, I was resolved to wait upon her within this
half hour, to know her resolutions in the business aforesaid: You understand me


Lord, Sir! how you and my Lady jump together. Let me never stir now, if she
has not sent me to you for the very same end and purpose; namely, that ye
should hye ye to her, and she would give your Worship all the satisfaction
imaginable


Say thou so, old boy? hold, here is six Fees I protest, a whole Guiny for
thy good news: Ten groats is below such a Message -- Spruce, here, take my Hat,
run, fetch my new Beaver, my Cane and my Gloves, quickly: I Will not demur a
minute. Oh, Sweet Mr. Trupenny


I vow to God, Sir, you are such an obliging man. -- Pray, Sir, have ye done
any thing in Mrs. Betty's business? I make bold to ask, because my Lady has
ordered me to slit that cause, as they say


Not yet, Sir; I protest, I have been so busy: But it shall be dispatched in
good time


Nay, nay, let it rest: it is fit the old one should be served first.


Sir, here are your things.


Well said: Give 'em me. So; now, Mr. Trupenny, I am ready to wait upon ye.
Come, Sir --


After you, Sir --


Lord, Mr. Trupenny, you are so Complemental! I vow, you shall go first --


Well, if it must be so --


O Lord, what had I forgot! Now if my life lay on it I cannot go till Dashwel
returns


I hope not so, Mr. Docket. God knows what occasion my Lady has of ye.


Ah, Mr. Trupenny, ye say true; and I would go with all my heart; but if you
did but know what occasion I have to stay at home at this time, you would not
blame me -- Hark ye, Sir, a word in private. You must know, Mr. Trupenny, I
have here in the house a very pretty young Niece, a great fortune she is: her
Father and Mother are both dead, but that is all one, for I am her Guardian


How Is this? a pretty woman in the house, and I never set eye on her as often as I
have been here? Time has been, that I have smelt out a pretty Wench at a
streets length: it is a sign I grow old


Nay, never wonder, Mr. Trupenny: She always keeps her Chamber, or to say true,
I keep her there. For I protest, here are so many idle fellows about the Town,
that I dare not let her be seen, as little as possibly. And besides that, I
have a constant eye upon her my self; but in my absence, I commit that trust
generally to Dashwel. As for this Spruce, he is a sly fellow, and I dare not
leave her to him


What, you are afraid they would be naught together while you are out? not
unlikely


No; but he is a cunning Raskal in these affairs: and who knows but he may let
her out to some young fellow, or else help some young fellow in to her?
Therefore I dare not trust him; and yet I would sain go to your Lady. --


What an unluckie thing is this! Is there no way? --


O Lord, Mr. Trupenny, now I think on it -- are you engaged in any urgent
business, at this time


All my business was only to you, Sir, with this Message -- But since you cannot
come, I must return, and let my Lady know it


No, no, that shall not be. I Will go my self: But in the mean time, sweet Mr.
Trupenny, let me conjure you, as you are my friend, and the like, to stay
behind and supply my place, as it were. You understand me? It Is but only till
Dashwel comes, which will be within this half hour


Nay, nay, if that be all, let me alone to watch her water; I Am old dog at that
office. I dare swear, I have occupied the place above twenty times in the
Country


O, Sir, how you oblige me? Well, I Will leave ye. Say nothing, but fall into
discourse with Spruce, and all is, well. I have tarri'd too long from your Lady,
I confess, but I Will redeem the time, and run all the way


What, is he gone, and does this fellow stay? O the Devil! Truman; and then
I Have lost my Credit for ever. Some trick must be thought of. -- Dear Sir, how
glad am I my Master has left us together? I have often wished this happy
opportunity, to be better acquainted with good Mr. Trupenny. I vow, Sir, you
are the goodest Gentleman I ever met with


O, Sir, your humble Servant. No great Gentleman neither: My Father was a
High-constable, and I am my Lady's Steward, in default of a better -- But I
pray, Mr. Spruce, if a man may be so bold -- what a clock is it


Not bolder than welcome, I assure ye, Sir. Why truly, Sir, I think it is
betwixt nine and ten


Aye, Sir; but I meant to have craved a glass of your small Beer, but I protest
I was almost ashamed


Indeed, Sir, it is none of the best, being very thin, and something sour: and
(as you say very well) it is a shame to drink it


Not so neither, Sir; I do not mean so, Sir; but I vow to Gad, Sir, your Master
pli'd me so with Mum last night, that I Am as dry this morning, as a Post horse;
and my stomach is a little -- as it were


Shall we go to the next Apothecaries, and drink a Gill of Stomach-water?


No, Sir, no, that needs not; my Lady has an excellent water in the Country
that she makes her self: but that is nothing, you will say, we are here, and
that is there


When all is done, I say, after a nights drinking, there is no settler like a
Dose of the same next morning. Come, Sir, you shall go with me to a place hard
by, where there is excellent Mum; faith, we'll have one pint together. Nay, it
shall not cost ye a farthing








Why don't ye hear, man?


Oh, cry ye mercy; I hear it now: It Is a young Lady of my acquaintance that
would be private


Nay, nay, I w'ont disturb her.


To tell ye true, it is my Masters Niece, whom he has, for faults best known to
himself, confined to her Chamber. I perceive she is preparing for a Song; and
then you will hear the best Voice in London, Mr. Trupenny


Aye marry Sir, I love singing with all my heart; and time was, when I could a
--


Whist, whist.


Ah! how charming is the shade,
How sweet the calm delight,
That in this amorous Grove is made;
How cool the shade, and yet the day how bright!
Hark! the little Philomel
On yonder Bough complains,
And while she her sad tale does tell,
Echo replies in the same mournful strains.
Thus, thus, is both the eye and ear
Ravished with what they see and hear.
Does not all this
Invite us to soft Love, and mutual Bliss?
See my Clymene, see,
How that enamored pair of Doves
With melting Sympathy,
Enjoy their ever equal Loves.
They know no ears, nor feel they ought
To trouble the more pleasing thought.
Full of the same
Soft fire they burn, and cherish the kind flame.
Ah! happy, happy they!
We two may full as happy be,
If you but smile, and say,
Content, Amyntas, I agree.
Content, Amyntas, I agree.
By that sigh, with which the Lady concludes her Song, I presume, Mr. Spruce,
she is in Love


Truly, Mr. Trupenny, it is not impossible; for our Ladies here in London are
apt, once in their lives at least, to love something or other: what they do in
the Country I know not. -- But a fig for your women, and all that belongs to
'em: Let us behave our selves like men. Methinks it is the unseemliest thing in
the world for us two to sit here like sots, when we have so excellent an
opportunity for a Voyage to the next Tavern or Alehouse, and taste a merry
Glass





I perceive ye are all very sober men, in your Country.


Nay, nay, no more Sobriety than will do us good; but that is all one. Look ye,
Mr. Spruce, for your Wine I don't love it, and for your Ale, ye have not a drop
in London worth drinking; that is the short on it


How, Mr. Trupenny, not a drop worth drinking? Did you ever taste our Cock-ale?


Cock-ale, no; what is that?


Why, there you show your ignorance. Look ye, Sir, I lay ye five pound you
shall say, ye never tasted the like in the Country


Nay, nay, nay, nay, five pound is a wager not to be laid among friends; and
besides that, I have not so much about me; but I hold a Crown, let it be what
it will, we have Ale in Darbyshire worth ten on it. --


Ye make me mad. I hold an Angel to your Crown, that after the first Bottle,
you your self shall confess, that for Color, Taste, Farewell, Body, and all
that, it excels your Darbyshire, as far as your Darbyshire excels your Dashwood


How, I confess it? Sir, here is the Guiny your Master gave me even now, I wager
this to your Angel, I Will be hanged first. Come, lead away; this wager shall be
tried presently. -- I Will stand up for my Country while I breathe


But perhaps you are otherways engaged at present; or perhaps you have made a
vow not to he seen in an Alehouse


No matter for that, Sir, I Will not suffer my Country to be run down, by never a
pitiful Londoner in England. Come along, Sir


Nay, then prepare to say, we have better drink.


Which if I do, I Will hang; that is fair I think.


WEll, now I have brought ye together, ye know best your own Affairs, and how
to husband time with most advantage. I must return to my Steward, that was so
lately, Madam, your trusty Overlooker


Prithee, what have thou done with him?


Why, faith, Sir, after I had drawn him from his Post, by the means I told ye,
I very soberly conveyed my Gentleman to the Cock-ale-house, where in conclusion
he will be very drunk: for, as good luck would have it, I was no sooner
entered, but I met there a certain true Trojan (indeed a Brother Clerk of my
acquaintance) I left him, after a charming glass or two gone round --


But missing you, may he not make an escape, suspecting --


His Companion's more trusty Keeper. No, Sir, no, he is as fast as if he were in
the Stocks for three lives; I mean, for parting Compos mentis. If he have not a
better opinion of London-Liquor ever after, let 'em spare their Cocks, and boil
me in the next Brewing: And that shall be called Spruce-ale -- Oh, how your
City-wives will flock to it


Sir, your Coach is ready, and waits where you appointed:


Enough. Come, Madam, give me the honor to conduct you to your Servant; whom
when you have known but half as well as I do, you will confess to be the
worthiest Lover, as I the best of Friends


You see, Sir, what a confidence I give to what you tell me, and how I trust
your Conduct. I must confess, with many Blushes, I have no Aversion to his love
or person: But still I tremble when I think my Uncle (whose severe nature I too
well know) may dash my happiness with many sorrows


Think not of that, dear Madam, Fortune is more indulgent. Your Uncle is this
morning with my Friend's Mother, a rich Widow, in the height of his Wooing:
And you may easily conclude, Madam, he dares not show displeasure at her Sons
Match, since so advantageous, for that is the way to disoblige his Mistress


Then, Sir, why may not he know it beforehand?


By no means. If so, he will undoubtedly by some sinister means prevent it, and
that purely for lucre of your Portion, Madam: But when it is done, he cannot
disapprove it, for the former Reason. Besides, an opportunity or advantage once
neglected, is in Love, as in a Battle, never to be recovered. --


Oh, Madam! we are all defeated: Yonder comes Dashwel, your old spy; if he sees
us here, or finds us not at home, he will raise the Hue and Cry, and we are lost
for ever


Fear nothing; but you three cross over there, and away: Leave me to him, and
if I don't prevent his doing mischief, think me a duller sot than he is


Oh! you are a rare one, to stay thus long.


I could not help it for my heart and blood, I vow now. A Countryman, an old
acquaintance, met me in Holborn, and would needs give me a Pint. -- But is my
Master gone out


No.


Then omnia been. I Will make haste to him, for I know he sits upon thorns. --


Hold. You must not go in: there is Madam Goodfeild with him, and they are
private. But should you know all, you would cut your throat, that is certain, for
being out of the way


What, Felo de se? I Will be hanged first. -- But prithee, good Spruce, what is
the matter


Of My Conscience, you deal with the Devil, or else you were wrapped in your
Mothers Smock; one of the two, I Am confident. Come, come, I know you make use of
Philters, Amulets, and Lovepotions, or something of that nature. --


If I do, the Dews take me. You know there is the Statute of Primo against it.


Aye, aye, but that is nothing: for here was Mrs. Loveal came with her Lady; but
now she is gone. --


Ah, what a Rogue was I to be away. -- Ah, sweet Mrs. Loveal! and how much she
made of me last night


Look ye; I knew you would run mad at this, and never hear me out.


Yes, yes, I will hear thee: Dear Spruce, say on.


With Mrs. Loveal came a delicate young thing about Eighteen, whom she called
Couzin; but I vow, she was the finest woman, I e're saw in my life --


Oh! --


Such a pretty Mouth, and such a little plump Lip, --


Oh! --


A little nimble Hand and Foot; and then withal so slender, you might span her.
--


Oh! --


Round amorous Breasts, that heave and pant with Love: white and soft as Down
of Swans --


Oh! --


Then to crown all, an Eye like any Basilick -- you know, Tom, a Basilick has a
delicate Eye


Aye, aye, -- Oh! that I had been at home. Oh! that cursed Countryman, and
that damned Tavern


Mrs. Loveal had not been entered so long as you might tell one hundred, but
that she asked me for ye -- and smiled like any thing


Did she e'faith? I vow, I am beholding to her.


I told her you were abroad. At this she seemed as sad as if she would had her
purse cut


Alack, alack, Poor heart!


After this she staid but little; and parting, with a low Courtesy, desired me
to remember her Love to ye, and tell ye, she and her Couzin were going directly
to the Folly, where they should both be very glad to see ye


Edad, I Will go put on a clean pair of Sleeves, and follow 'em immediately. --


Ye ben't mad? If ye loose time ye loose 'em. They are hardly got to the'
Temple-stairs yet: Away directly, it is ten to one you overtake 'em


Ye say true; farewell. If my Master ask for me, make some Lie or other, and
all is well


Let me alone for lying -- But do you hear? She bid me tell you, that if you
find 'em not at the Folly, you will not fail to have 'em in the long Walk at
the New-spring-garden


Enough --


One word more. -- But, says she, If we should chance to be gone from thence,
he will be sure to meet me at my Couzins Lodgings --


Dear Spruce, where is that?


At the sign of the Windmil in the Old-pell-mell.


Enough, enough; I Will not delay my joys one minute longer.


So; thou art secure for one three hours. This Dashwel is the easiest Gudgion!
he gulps a Lie as readily as Juglers swallow Knives. Now to my Steward; if he
has swallowed Glasses with equal haste and pleasure, he is in his altitudes by
this time


NOW I can call you Sister again, with a safe Conscience. Methinks, before ye
looked like a Brother of the Blade, or a kind of little Huff. -- Come, bear up,
the Rendezvous is not far off


Methinks you are grown very Heroic, Brother? you think of nothing but close
fighting. For my part, since I am returned to Petticoats again, my mind is not
so masculine as lately. And I consider, more distance would more become this
Habit


Cunning Hypocrite! Now should not I proceed in this Assignation, you your self
would be my chief Tormentor; and my own flesh and blood, like another Brutus,
would give me the first Bodkin. --


As sure as can be.


Fie, fie, Sister, be more ingenious: This backward dissimulation of a longing
Female, is odious in a Person of Quality, and a Town-Lady, and shows the
coursest breeding in the world. I shall be ashamed to keep you company, unless
you converse with more Integrity and Candor


Faith, Brother, I cannot help it. Since I shifted my Apparel, I am infected
with what belongs to a Petticoat and Wastecoat: it is the humor of the Garment,
and therefore you must pardon me


I do; but Jack Truman shall prescribe your Penance, which if it be more
pleasant than the fault deserves, you ought to thank your too indulgent
Confessor


A propos: Let us make haste then to the place of Exccution. But by the way,
Brother, let me tell you, I think it would be better if --


Away with your impertinent Propositions. I think there is nothing in nature so
Capricious as a she-wit. Is this a time for advice, when it is now near eleven
a clock, and you know what we are to do effectually before twelve


Yet do but hear my Reasons.


Well, Madam, since we are agreed on the main point in Issue, and you are
pleased once more to lie under Covert-Baron, there is now no more to be done,
but to turn down this lane, and we shall quickly arrive at an honest Parson's,
my intimate acquaintance, indeed the Ordinary of Newgate, who will give us the
Book of Matrimony as compendiously as if he were to teach the Neckverse


Soft, Mr. Docket, though we have a Country-proverb, that Marriage and Hanging
go by Destiny, yet methinks, for lucksake, I would not be married by one that
deals so near the Gallows


The truth is, Madam, he has often promised to marry me for nothing: but that is
all one; rather than displease my dear Widow, I am content to loose his
Assumpsit. How like ye, Madam, to be married by a Reader of an Inns a Court? I
know 'em all


By no means, Sir: Do your Readers at the Inns a Court marry fokes? Never stir,
now that is as bad as to be married by a Justice of Peace, out upon it


Nay, my Dear, you mistake me clearly. I mean, a Chappel-Reader.


Cry ye mercy, Mr. Docket, I understand ye now. Well, Sir, what you please. --
O my heart! Come hither, Loveal; do ye know those two that stand talking yonder


As I hope to live and do well, Madam, I dare say it is Mr. Edward Goodfeild,
and Mrs. Betty, your Ladyships only Son and Daughter. Nay, I Will be sworn
yonder is Frank too


I vow, I think so. But how come they together, and in London? I left my
Daughter in the Country, and sure an God'll my Son's at Cambridge


I fear me, Madam, there is some naughty design in hand; for I dare swearupon a
Book it is they


Never trouble your self, Madam, London's a large place, and here is one body or
other like every body in the Nation. For my part; I have sometimes met somebody
as I have been going along the street, as like somebody as I know, as e're you
saw; and yet when all came to all I have been deceived


Now let me die, and all that, Brother, but yonder is my Mother and her new
Servant, a't'other side the way; and as the Devil would have it, she has spied
us. What shall we do in this case? this is no time to take notice of Mothers


Well, to be sure, Loveal, we'll walk softly before. Do you step over the way,
and see if it be they for certain, and then follow us


Brother, we are all undone: This wicked Mother of ours has sent her woman over
to make further discovery. Look where she comes


Madam, you spoil all: Be not surprised, but you two stand aside as
unconcerned, and leave me to her; if I don't send her off with less
satisfaction than she came on, say I Am not worth your Service


Belamy! Ah, how bless am I to see me good Friend a Londres! Merdugues, I am
de happy woman in de varlde


What means this Gibbrish? I understand not a word she says.


Ah, Madame, you cunno I speak no good Englesh. I have been but two day in dis
City. Mais Ie Scais bien que vous parlez bon Francois


Now, for ought I know, she bids the Devil take me, in French. Lord, to see how
I was mistaken, to think this was Frank. Well, I Will e'ne back again, and say
nothing, lest I appear as much beside the Cushion as she i


Belamy, verfore are you so estrange? Ma foy, have you oblie how ver merry we
were ensemble last soomer, vid Messieurs de Cour Dauphnie, at de little
Caberet, Au test noir, in de Ru'e St. Jasques a Paris? Look you, Madame, dear
stand me ver good friend Monsieur le Marquis de Montausiere, vid his Sister
Madame de Fountain-amante. Give me de honor, Je vous supply, to introduce you
into his cunnisance: you will find him de ver noble Gentlemane, and he will make
ver mush of your body, begar


Pray let me go, Mistress. -- Fie upon her, for a naughty woman! I shall be
undone if I stay


You need no be affear, sweet Madam Belamy, he was ver well cure a Roan, before
he came in Engleterre, begar


Let me go, I say. I know ye not, not I. And you are mistaken in me, that you
are; I am none of those you take me for: my name's Loveal, and not Bellany --
How I hate the looks of these French people! It Is no wonder we cannot abide em.
For my part, I never saw any of 'em before, and I hope, never shall again --
Let me go, I say


Ma foy, Madame; me ask your pardon tres-humblement, if you be not dat good
English Lady Maistress Belamy, in whose company I have had the great honor to
be garanted a Paris and Fountainbleau. Yet for that you are so ver like the
good graces of me dear friend, if you do please to go along vid Monsieur,
Madame, and your Servante, to a little Frigate below de bridge, we have dear one
two tree glasses of ver excellent Frontiniack, and de little Collation, to
which you will do very great honor, Si vous plaist


O Lord, a Spirit, a Spiritd a French Spirit! I shall be carried to Barbado's.
Away, Spirit, farewell, Satan; I have heard of your tricks. But soft, older and
wiser


Well* how like ye my dispatch?


Oh, most cleverly done, Wench! 'Twas a neat Conveyance; there is never a Lawyer
of 'em in Town can draw a better. Take my best French Point, tomorrow, for thy
witty French Wheedle


'Faith 'twas a most important Service, my Girl: and Monsieur the Marquess de
Montausere is your very humble Servant for it. Without doubt, had Loveal been
confirmed in her untimely knowledge of us, it would have been no small
obstruction to our Designs


Yet was the pleasure of the action greater than the profit. I vow, Madam de
Fountain-amante had much ado to keep the due Grimace proper to a person of her
Quality, and not laugh outright. -- But, I Will stay here no longer, Brothers,
not only to avoid such another Rancounter, but chiefly, because I long to be at
my Journeys end


That is, you think it long to night. I understand ye, Sister.


It Is well you do: walk you before, while my Maid ties my shoo-string -- I Will
follow immediately --


Prithee make haste --


So, he is gone


'Slife, Madam, what will your Brother and Servant apprehend from such delays?
--


No matter for my Brother; as for my Servant, this is my last effort to
exercise his patience, and try how much he loves me -- Come away, away --


WEll, all this cannot be helped. But the Devil's in the Cards, that is plain. Uds
bud, I Have played at Put a thousand times, and a thousand to that, but I never
had such cursed luck before -- Come, Sir, shuffle: But first let us draw the
Table more to the light; Gad I have drunk so much, I can scarcely see


Sha, sha! this is nothing: Give me a man that can sit at it from twelve at
noon, to twelve at night, then go to bed sober, and swear there is no strong
drink in London: there is your true English heart of Oak


As I live Mr. Clarke, you say finely. -- But let us to our Books again --


Ten such as these would overrun the Low Countries, and drown all Germany in a
Rummer. Come, Sir, before we go any further, here is one brimmer to your better
fortune. ( drinks) Faith, Sir, you have the worst luck of any man living. Loose
Eleven games together and never turn Stake? why, you don't drink well, man.
Unless you plie the Glass with better Courage, you will never win a game at One
and thirty


Say ye so? Nay, then fill it up; I Will do ye right, e'faith, Boy. If you
provoke me once at this Weapon, you will find me a mad Boy; I Will tell you that


Sa, sa. That Is he, that is he.


Now, Sir, deal. --


Why then I Am gone. You know, Sir, I Am bound and cannot refuse: Play away --
that is mine; and there is a Tray, e'faith


That Is tied. --


Gad, there is another Tray, win it and wear it.


Uds, I Have lost. Was ever such damned luck? -- Well, I will not leave ye yet --
Drawer, bring a fresh pack o'Cards -- Come, Sir, I Will double the Stakes; what a
Devil, I cannot loose always -- Let me see --


How, Sir, lend? Sbud, Sir, you are not in earnest? what butter me with my own
money? this is worse than to play upon tick: You must know, Mr. Trupenny,
there is a Statute against it; and besides that, it is not the custom of London,
I assure ye


No? why then -- hark ye, Drawer, a word with ye: thou seem an honest
fellow.


Faith, Sir, I cannot, and it were to save my life. -- By and by, by and by, I
come, I come, Sir


Why there is the Devil. Oh, here comes Mr. Spruce: nay; then I care not.


Gentlemen, I must seriously beg your pardon: I have been diverted by so many
unluckie accidents, that I protest, my stay has been almost an hour longer than
I intended


There needs no Apology, sweet Mr. Spruce; we have been so seriously engaged
since you went, that we scarce ever thought o'you


Well, then I hope you like the Ale, Mr. Trupenny. Come, where stands the
Glass? we'll whisk it about, e'faith, boys


Nay, nay, nay, Mr. Spruce, never talk of that. Whisk quoth a? I have had
enough of Put, one would think; but that is all one. Hark ye, Mr. Spruce, one
word in private: Mr. Spruce, as I hope to live now -- yet first I should have
told ye -- but that is no matter neither -- then as I was saying, Sir, your
friend yonder has won Thirty shillings of me at half-Crown-put; and nothing
vexes me, but he has not left me money enough for another stake. Now, worthy
Mr. Spruce, as the saying is, I take you for my friend, and I hope to sinde ye
so: Can ye do a man the favor, Sir, as to lend a Crown, or an Angel? As I Am an
honest man, you shall have it again


What to do, Mr. Trupenny?


Only to win my Thirty shillings back again: nothing else, I protest.


How, Mr. Trupenny, win it back? I perceive you don't know Mr. Clark: why he is
the only Put-man in Town. I hold ye six to four, an ye play with him till
midnight, ye shall never win two pence of him. He knows ye all the Cards as
well as he that made 'em; and then for the sleek, the nip, the double, and all
that, he is the Devil of a Gamster


Nay, Guds sooks, if he be the Devil of a Gamster, I have nothing to say to
him. 'Sbud I always thought some such thing. -- But now, how shall we do to
pass the time? methinks now I Am in, I Am loath to leave good company


What think ye of a Wench, Mr. Trupenny? I know a Miss hard by, that is
excellent company, Gad: What say ye


Not a word more of that, if you love me, Mr. Spruce. For ought I know, she may
be the Devil of a Gamester too. And then, look ye, I had rather loose Thirty
shillings at Cards, than give a Surgeon Forty shillings for a cure, and Three
pound for seeresie. I must confess, look ye, Mr. Spruce, I love the sport well
enough; but pox on it, there is no doing in this noughty Town of London, (as my
Lady calls it.) Besides, Sir, should I get it, you understand me; Uds bud, Sir,
it were enough to spoil a whole Country. -- Come, come, without further
ceremony, let us all sit down, and drink while we can stand. Mr. Spruce, my
Service to ye


Sir, your humble Servant --


But pray, Mr. Trupenny, why are you such an enemy to London?


Fough, I hate it. -- Why, did you never hear the Song?


The Song, what Song?


Why this it is to be an ignorant Londoner. -- I Will tell ye, Mr. Spruce, for you
are my friend, and an understanding person. It was made by a very honest fellow
in our Country that chanced to be at Bartholomew-fair once, and had his pocket
picked


Aye, aye, I knew him very well; his name was Bartholomew Cokes.


No, Sir, he was none of your Cokes, I assure ye, but a Kinsman of mine at
Mansfield. To see how your'e mistaken with your Cokes 's. --


Nay, nay, never mind him, man, but on with your Song.


Cuds bud, it is the finest Song you e're heard in your life. The Clerk of our
Parish sings it rarely to the tune of the Sixteenth Psalm, and it will go to
Green sleeves, but that is all one -- I Will sing it as well as I can


Aye, sweet Mr. Trupenny, let us have it.


Hem, hem. -- Faith, Gentlemen, my voice is but so, so. But that is no matter.
Time was when I could have done well; but --


O London, wicked London-Town!
Whose Spots so many and so brown,
Deform thy face in such a fashion,
Thou do appear the one black Patch --
Yea, of the Nation.
Ye Ladies that wear powdered Toors:
Ye honest Women eek, and Whores,
Reform your lives, and by degrees
Leave the Back-fall, and rather fall --
Yea, on your knees.
Ye Gallants that wear Sword and Scabbard;
Ye Coopers eek, that deal in Clapboard,
Repent for shame: and do ye hear?
Drink no more Sack, but rather Ale --
Yea, drink small Beer.
Ye men of Trade that deal in Lying,
I mean, in Selling and in Buying,
Look to your Wives, for it is spoken,
They are as cracked as you your selves --
Yea, full as broken --
Boy, bring another Chamber Pot. Plague on ye, you Rogue, you never empty.

Did thou ever hear a foolish Song worse sung in thy life, Dick Clark?


It Is beyond expectation ridiculous. -- But hang him; this Country-Fop begins
to be cursed drunk, and his humor will quickly become tedious: Let Us dispatch
him, and away


Withal my heart. The Other Glass does the work.


Or else the Devil's in him. Let me die, I am consident the Sot has drunk at
least Eight or ten bottles for his own share in less than an hour. While he was
busy in play, I used to fill the Glass and set it by him, and he would never
mind, but take off Three or Four together in that manner. As for example, you
shall see -- Trupenny


No, Sir, not droop; there is nothing of drooping in the case, I assure you; but
only I was thinking of a thing which I had quite forgot; that is, Mr. Spruce,
how I should have staid at your Master's Chamber, about a thing that I know --
But hanged let it pass, here is a Health in a Rummer


I protest, Mr. Trupenny, you are the merriest man -- Ha, ha, he -- But all
this while I must not forget to be civil. Look you, Mr. Trupenny, here is one
Glass I Will put about to your best Concern; I mean, the good health of your good
Lady Madam Goodfeild -- Mr. Clark, my Service to you


Hold, Sir -- you shall excuse me, efeckins.


What, not your Ladies health?


Not so, Sir; I do not mean so, Sir, I assure you: But only I Will begin it my
self -- well, I say nothing; but she is as good a Lady as any in England, and
has as able a Servant as any in the world -- but that is all one. I defy your
pimping Glasses Clark, here is to ye, with all my heart --


Ah, pure Country-frolick *


The Rogue's mad.


How he stares --


And blows --


And sweats at it. --


How now, Mr. Trupenny?





Rather, you want two -- Come, Clark, here is no more to be done. Now, which way
are you bound


Here, Drawer, here is the Reckoning -- Faith, Jack, now I have recruited my
Pockets indifferently well; I must directly into Holborn: I have a certain
Intrigue there, with a Cutler's Wife, that must not be neglected. Farewell


Drawer, run and fetch a Porter with a great Basket; and do hear --


A little below Fetter-lane, say you, Sir?


Yes. I leave this to thy manage: Do it ingeniously, and here is shilling for
thy pains


Thank ye, noble Master. Let me alone for Roguery --


E'faith, now, it is all off -- and -- e -- gad I can drink no more.


Let me help ye up, Sir, -- methinks you're something heavy --


Nay, nay, nay -- take off your Bottle, Mr. Spruce; Uds bud, I Will not bate ye
an Ace, look ye. -- Ho'now, what are you? the Drawer? Ah, poor little Drawer,
let me kiss thee -- where is Mr. Spruce, ye Rogue Drawer


Sir, the Gentlemen are stepped into the next Room, only to --


As I hope to live, I Will follow them, and see my self pledged, and then, --
call a Coach, ye Rogue -- for I can drink no more, ye Rogue -- but will go home
like a Prince, ye Son of a Nine-eyes


This way, Sir.


Lord! what a wide Town is this London; I have been, I believe, in Forty
several places, but cannot find my Mistress out -- nor in all my Jaunt I have
not met with Trupenny: Pray Heaven he be not spirited away by that strange
French creature -- Well, I dare swear she had the foul Disease, she spoke so
strangely; for I have heard folk say, it alters the speech much: Out upon her
for a filthy beast; I warrant it is so


Mrs. Loveal! most happily met --


Mr. Spruce! I profess, I am glad I have met with somebody I know; I had like
to have been spirited away, which so scared me, that I was forced to run for
it; if I had not, I vow, I do believe I should never have seen Darbyshire more.
But pray, Mr. Spruce, may I be so bold to ask where people use to be married in
London? for my Mistress is gone with Mr. Docket on that design, but I cannot
find 'em --


If you will permit me the honor of waiting on you, I will show you the place
--


Indeed, Sir, I would not trouble you; but if you can tell me where our Steward
Trupenny is, he shall go with me -- I protest to you, he has not seen home
since he went this morning to your Master's Chamber: I wonder where a murrain
he should be! --


I left him just now drinking a Glass at the Cock-ale-house, with a Countryman
of his, whom he met with by chance --


The Devil take him; he will get drunk, and then there will be no ho with him: He
is as mad as a Buck in Rutting-time, when he is in his Beer, as they say --


But, Mrs. Loveal, I have a Request to you, in behalf of a poor despairing
Lover: good Soul, loosing his heart in your company, he is wandering about the
Town to find you out -- for they are your Eyes have conquered him --


Nay, good Mr. Spruce, no more, if you love me; you act the flattering Courtier
now -- but I confess, I have had some languishing looks in my time; I will
assure you, they have been called the Sun, Moon, and seven Stars too: Nay, I
believe I can look killingly still; see, Mr. Spruce, do I not? --


Such looks would kill a Basilisk --


Nay, nay, I could have done, but alas, alas, I grow old, yet not so old, but I
have seen my Elders doated on, aye, and by young men too -- I vow by my
Virginity, I am but forty odd --





Ha, ha, he, that is true; Trupenny knows it of me; but (though with much ado,
I must tell you) I am honest, I can assure you -- but not to appear uncivil,
May I, without offense, desire to know who this poor creature is? for I pity
him heartily; and I vow to you, I am so charitable, I would not have him cast
himself away for me, poor Soul, for the world --


To say true, it is Dashwel, my fellow-clerk --


Loving Mr. Dashwel -- now, Mr. Spruce, I dare swear Marriages are made in
Heaven; for I must confess -- yet, ha, ha, he, you will perhaps wonder at my
confidence, I have had a great kindness for him from the first time I saw him
-- but I vow, I mean honestly --


But you have not only vanquished him, but another too that has seen you, is
become your Admirer; and he being jealous of Dashwel, has on purpose sent him
out of the way, that he might have the freer converse with you -- and now --


Mr. Spruce, speak not for him -- if you do, I must deny you; for I vow to you,
I can like none but Mr. Dashwel --


Then woe to unfortunate Spruce, that must die with despair -- the wretchedest
creature on the earth --


Lord, Mr. Spruce, is it you? hold, hold, Sir, and take some of my Spirit to
comfort you -- but I fear you do but play the rogue


I swear --


Nay, nay, I vow I believe you do not -- and tell you true, you are the only
man I wished to be my Husband; and to show my good nature -- see, I am ready to
sacrifice my self to your will: But ha! bless me, what is here


Why, you young Sons of Whores, what ado is here? did you never see a man ride
in a Coach before? -- Ha, Mr. Spruce, and my old Mother Midnight Loveal -- So
ho, Mr. Spruce. Mrs. Loveal, will you ride? hold Coachman, hold you Rogue --
Yfeck it is fine riding


Now, out upon him for a beast, and a shame take all ill-luck, say I, for
making me loose your good company: Now must I go put him to bed, or my Mistress
will lead me such a life -- for he is my charge when he is in this condition --
a filthy beast -- farewell, sweet Mr. Spruce, till an hour hence, and then I
will steal out to finish the business you wot of, if you think fit


Farewell, Fondling.
Now to my Lovers
Whose serious Passion merits more success:
This is but Love-burlesque, or something less.

YOu see, Mr. Truman, I have performed what you desired; but know, had I not
been well assured that that was true you told me, I should not have so soon, or
easily consented: and I hope, Sir, you will not impute it either to folly or
fondness, but to an Uncle's rigor, that made me act what now I have done


Far be it from me, Madam, to harbor such base thoughts of one so Virtuous --
but I shall ever acknowledge the favor my best of Friends has done me. -- And
Friend, suspect not my Sisters fidelity, for I know she has so just a sense of
Honor, that what she promises she will perform: Yet, I must confess, her long
stay somewhat startles me


Use no farther motives, for they will rather induce me to cherish, than
dissipate my breeding Jealousies: Her Country-innocence is an argument more
prevailing than all your Rhetoric. Were she indeed one of the gay Ladies of
the Town, whose words and actions never agree, I should have known how to have
managed my Amor


Your Boy, Mr. Truman, perhaps brings some news of the Lady --


Sirrah, have you met with Madam Goodfeild?


Yes, Sir; and she is just now going to be married to a Gentleman that is with
her


How, to another? Now, Ned, I begin to suspect thy fidelity.


It is impossible she should be false: the boy mistakes.


I am sure, Sir, that what I say is truth; for I sifted it out of their boy;
who told me, his Lady Mrs. Goodfeild and Mr. Docket were going to be married


Docket! blessed mistake! it is thy Mother, Ned -- now my hopes revive again.


Did not I tell thee, Jack, it was a mistake? but, Sirrah, are they not married
yet


No, Sir, for one Parson denied them, the Canonical hour being past, and they
having no License neither, so that now they are coming to Lincoln's Inn, in
hopes to find the Reader within, who is Mr. Docket's friend


Better than I could have wished. Jack, as thou love me or my Sister, contrive
some way to hinder this match; I hate the thoughts of being controled or allied
to such an impertinent Ignoramus -- besides, who knows but he may wheedle her
out of what would be our due, when she dies


They come; therefore retire, Ned, with thy Mistress, and something I will do
to manifest my Love for thy Sister -- I have it --


Good luck attend thee.


Oh, Mr. Docket, I am glad I have met you --


To see me married, you would say, -- Why, look you, Mr. Truman, you must
excuse me, that I did not invite you. Widows use to go to it with secrecy; and
for my part, I love not to blazon to the world what I am going about


Pray, Mr. Docket, what Gentleman is that? he seems to be a person of Worth --


Why, lovely Bride, it is a worthy friend of mine, a man of a fair State, and
sober Conversation -- therefore for my sake salute him


Madam, your humble Servant -- but, Mr. Docket -- your Niece --


My Niece? what of her? -- Oh you like her -- and would, with my consent,
marry her, and by that means relieve your Mortgage -- Why look you, Mr.
Truman, I want money -- and you know --


Right, I do know, Mr. Docket, that unless you make haste, your Niece will be
stole away and married


How, stole away, and married? undone -- undone -- but now I think on it, let
um if they dare, I Will bring my Writ of Ravishment de Guard against them: But for
fear of the worst, good Friend, keep my Widow company till I step home, and
I Will return immediately -- Oh Heavens, my Niece stole! I Will firk un e'faith


Now, Widow, since the old Goat is shifted off, let us make the best use of our
time we can --


As how? I pray -- (I hope he will not be uncivil --


Why in chousing the old fool, by taking me into his place --


What, marry you? that would be fine --


Certain, Widow, there is some difference between me and the Lawyer Docket:
First, I am younger, and consequently fitter for a Widow's service: In the next
place, I am richer, to please her A varice: and lastly, not to flatter my self,
I think I am handsomer to beget Christian-like Children; for, Agad, if this
fellow get any, it must be with his Inkhorn, and what they will prove, judge
you --


I vow, Sir, you are a pleasant Gentleman -- but --


No buts, good Widow, but along, for I am all-over in Love; and till I
overwhelm thee with kindness, I shall not be my self --


But may I trust to you, that you are inearnest? -- I swear, a comely person,
and so like Squire Goodfeild, that was! I warrant an able person -- London*
tricks on me: I fear you do but exercise your Wit upon me; for you
Town-Gallants love to flout poor Countrie-Gentlewomen to make you sport --


If thou delayest one minute longer, Widow, I Will vow to blast thy Reputation,
kill all that dare pretend to you, and at last, in spite of thy self, enjoy
thee, and then Jilt thee --


Goodness! what prittie words you Gentlemen have; Jilt me? well, that must be
some fine thing, it sounds so well; Jilt -- I might have lived in Darbyshire to
Methusabem's age, and not have heard such fine things


Uds precious, Widow, what mean you? -- swear instantly to be mine, or I vow, I
will prosecute what I told you --


Hold, hold, Sir, I will swear or do any thing -- but is this the London-way of
Courtship? -- It is somewhat boisterous, methinks, to force a woman to have a
man whether she will or no -- but Lord, what will Mr. Docket say, if I should
cousin him? -- I vow, now I think on it, I cannot, for my honor is engaged, and
he has my word to be none but his --


What an unmannerly old-fashioned Widow art thou to talk thus


No more, good Sir, and here is my hand, I will be none but yours -- but what
shall we do about Mr. Docket? I would be loath, now he is set agog, as they
say; he should be disappointed: were it my own case, I should not be pleased --


Hang him -- but however, I will contrive some means how to bestow him, now he
is agog, as you say --


So, I have put Trupenny to sleep, and now I will steal to Mr. Spruce, who
longs for my coming: I dare say, poor Soul -- well, he is as loving good
conditioned sweet natured young man as lives, though I say it. -- Ha! my Lady
here? if she sees me, I am ruined --


Oh, Loveal! were they my Son and Daughter we met an hour ago? --


No, Madam, we were both mistaken; they were your Beyond Sea French folk,
Papists I warrant they were, they had such hard names; and they jabber'd so, it
would have frightened you to have heard them speak


I durst to have sworn it had been them --


Is this your Maid, Madam? --


Yes, Sir, for want of a better --


Fortune is kinder to us than we could have expected -- What should hinder your
Maid supplying your place, and marry Mr. Docket


Why nothing, Sir, sure; for now I shall oblige her, and keep my word too; for
she to sadly longs for a Husband, that I was forced to promise to help her to
one; and I must have bought one, rather than have failed, or I should have led
a tedious life with her --


Well, Madam, if you will give her a little instructions how to personate your
self, I will step to the Temple in the interim, and find out a Parson there to
complete our business, and in the Cloisters I will expect you -- till then,
dear Widow, your Servant. In the mean time let my Boy attend you


Your humble Servant, Sir -- Loveal, I remembering my promise to you, have
accordingly found out a Husband for you. This Gentleman that is gone --


Well, this London is a brave place for Husbands; I wonder not now what makes
the Countrie-maids flock up so fast to it -- had I known so much before, I
would not have stayed so long in Darbyshire -- and I vow, this Gentleman is as
handsome a man as ever a Darbyshire-blade of 'um all


Hold, you are too fast, Loveal, this is not the man, but he and I have found
out one for you


How, is not he the man? nay, then, Madam, know, I have not been so long in
Town, but that my good fortune has provided for me; and had not your Ladyship
seen me, within an hour I had altered my condition


What, were you going to be married? to whom I pray?


Either to Mr. Dashwel, or Mr. Spruce, I know not which; for both, poor things,
are so much in love with me, that I was resolved to marry the first of 'um I
met


Dashwel and Spruce? Come, come, you are a fool; but be ruled by me, and you
shall marry their Master


Mr. Docket! now, Madam, you jeer me; for I cannot believe you will give him
away from your self


Thou may be sure, Wench, I have provided otherways for my self, or I
should hardly have parted with him


Well, Madam, do with me as you please: for since I have had Love made to me,
my mind so runs on Matrimony, that I shall not be my self till I have entered
into that delicious kind of life


See, Mr. Docket comes; here, put on my great Scarf and Vail, and be sure not
to show your face till you come home, but pretend an unusual Modesty, and play
no old Ape's tricks of Fondness, but behave your self decently, and counterfeit
my Speech, for he must take you for me; and when he comes, ask him if he has
found his Niece. -- Do you think you can do all this? I much doubt your Ability


I Will warrant you, Madam -- what not remember how to wheedle a man, and of this
Age? it has been my practice this twenty years: But I must confess, my
over-forwardness was the cause of my ill success; but I Will have more wit
hereafter; and if I carry it not swimmingly, may I die before I taste the
sweets of Matrimony, which is a most insupportable Curse


Be sure you take heed; my Honor will suffer if you prove too coming, as they
phrase it. -- And now for my smug handsome young Gentleman. -- Well, Mr.
Docket, you may thank your self for this deceit; for by your own confession he
is richer, and my own eyes tell me he is both handsomer and younger, and
consequently fitter to satisfy a Widows love


Certainly there is more in it than I can apprehend, that Mr. Truman should
tell me such a story! for I met Dashwel, and he protestando said, my Niece was
safe at home. Ha! well thought on, if he should be stolen away with my Widow?
-- How, how, no Truman! Docket, Docket, where is thy Widow, man


Docket, that unmannerly clownish friend of yours left me alone so soon as you
was gone; but I was resolved to stay, were it till midnight: But pray now, have
you found your Niece


It is her voice -- Sing O be joyful -- Widow mine, my Niece is safe -- and now
I have thee once more, I am resolved not to let thee go till we have joined
Issue -- But why this Vail? A Widow and bashful? for shame turn up -- in troth
I will bring a Levari facias


Hold, hold, Mr. Docket, let me hide my blushes; when we are fast to one
another, as they say, then you shall turn up what you please


Say thou so, Widow? along, along then, for fear of another Demurrer.


WHat would she have? I know her not. Has she not picked my pocket?


This is the rarest Mortal I ever met with: see how the Rogue shakes! But Mr.
Anthony --


I say once more, Gentlewoman, you are mistaken; my name is neither John,
Humphery, Dick, Rowland, Ieossery, Stephen, Anthony, nor Mark Anthony neither,
but plain Thomas Dashwel, senior Clerk to Mr. Docket


Your Father-in-law's Clerk, on my life, Madam. A word, Sir; is not your Master
an Attorney of Cliffords-Inn


Yes, and Gentleman too.


He is about marrying a Darbyshire-widow --


Yes, yes, they are Legitimo Matrimonio copulat' by this time.


Her name, Goodfeild --


Right -- If this should be the Devil I have been talking with all this while?


Friend, haste to thy Master, tell him if he marries the Widow, this night will
prove his last: I have decreed it, I his fate have said it


It is a Devil, of my conscience; would I were rid of her company. Nay, nay,
nay, pray forsooth keep more distance -- Look, look, her Eyes are all of a
flame, and I shall be damned before my time


What a Rogue am I to disappoint a longing Widow? but when she shall know it
was for younger flesh, she will not certainly be so unreasonable to blame me.
-- Well, her Daughter is a witty wild frollicking Raskal, and I love her to
excess; but her absence sets my patience on the Rack


Oh, Mr. Truman, I am glad you are come.


What Is the matter, man? thou look as if thou were scared out of thy little
Wits


Wits quoth I? here stands, I fear, the Ruins of one who once was a hopeful
Pleader. See, see, Mr. Truman, this Petticoat-Sathan has made diverse and sundry
assaults manus graviter imposuit, and cetera, insultum fecit vi and armis
verbis opprobriis and minis -- I have a good mind to swear the Peace against
her -- But oh, good sweet Mr. Truman -- she approaches; as I hope to draw a
Plea again, I will be gone, and so the Devil take the hindmost


Some well-meaning Punck, on my life, following her Calling. It is easier to
see a Court-Lady in her natural Complexion, than Fleet Street and the Temples
without this kind of Cattle


Have at my Temple-lover once more; if he proves according to my wish, he is my
own. I Will try if he is one of the Fashionable Town-Gallants, who, good-natured
Souls, keep Wenches for others as well as for themselves


If he proves constant after all these trials, with my consent he should be
Chronicled


Your name is Truman, as I take it.


You take it right.


And for want of wit, your dull sottish Worship is entering into the bonds of
Matrimony


How the Devil came you to know it? it is neither in Gazet, nor Banes yet
askti'th' Church


Gad sa' me, you are a base perfidious fellow.


Dam me! a Raskal.


Hie day, Petticoat-hectors?


To use a Lady thus?


Use her? how? what Lady? which of ye?


Me, ungrateful man? but I Will have your throat cut, Mister --


Or nose slit, look ye.


Dashwel's words prove true; these are a couple of Devils: Nothing but Blood
and Wounds! 'Sbud who are ye? and why this anger to me, Damsels


Treacherous perjured Villain, who was not only content to debauch me, a poor
innocent Country-girl -- but notwithstanding thousands of protestations of
keeping me with a gilt Coach, and set of Horses for three lives, or one and
twenty years, at last to Jilt me. But hang you, Renegado, your promises,
performances, and treats, prove all too sligh tfor a Ladies service. -- Follow
me, if you dare


Villain? perjured? debaucht? gilt Coach? Jilt me? treats? What a Pox is the
meaning of all this? Hold, hold, Madam Mystery, Gad e're you and I part, you
must explain your self a little better


Unworthy man, how often did you treat me at Plays, the Park, and
Mulberry-garden, before I yielded? Have you forgot that too -- and how you
carried me to Tunbridge


Yes, Madam; by the same token he had not money enough to pay the lodging, so
that you were forced to pledge your little Dog for Nine and six pence, to save
his honor -- It Is true, when we came to London he sent his Tailor to redeem
him, which he put to his account for this Suit he has on; but I suppose you do
not remember this


Thou -- I know not what! a Puppie save my Honor? thou riddleing lying Satan,
vanish, or --


I warrant you have forgot too, how last Winter you presented me a Gennet Muff
of a Noble, and at the same time promised me a Ring worth five Guinies, on
condition I would praise your Dancing to my Lady: which I did, but from that
hour to this, I never saw or Ring or Gold


Oh, impudent Jilt!


Faithless man! consider who it is that courts you to be constant.


Think of her Beauty and Behavior.


Her Faith in violate.


Her singular Modesty!


Aye, her Modesty; but above all, her Blood and Affinity: Think of her
Relations at Court, able to promote you to what Pitch she pleases: Half a word
from her, can make you a Justice of Quorum, and send you into the Country with
a Commission to domineer over your Betters. I Will tell you as a secret, there is
my Lord -- hum -- and Sir Thomus -- hum -- have been her Couzins any time this
six years, off and on


In fine, tell me, as you are a Gentleman and no Soldier, how can you find in
your heart to forsake a Lady thus, and undo your self by marrying


To forsake one that loves you, to be tied to one for life, who without
question, if she has any wit, as you are Husband, will hate and Cuckold you --
Ha, ha, he


Aye, one that loves and doats upon you -- Ha, ha, he.


Was ever man thus baited by a couple of Vizard-masks?


Faith I think not.


Oh that I were but a man, for thy sake! I have been too much a woman, I Am sure.


Nay, nay, Madam, rather than fail, I Will hire a pair of Breeches at the next
Broakers, and then break his pate, for all this


Why, thou, thou, what shall I call thee? thou unheard of Jilt, and thou other
Spirit of impudence, what Devil set you on to abuse me thus? Follow me no
further, but tremble at the Neighborhood of Bridewel, and be silent


How now, Sister! what do you here?


How? his Sister! 'Slife I am ruined.


Oh, Jack here too! -- then I perceive the business is done betwixt my Sister
and you. -- Methinks you walk at distance like man and wife already


No, Ned, it is undone, and I so too, if you stand not my friend to her: thy
Sister, whom I had never seen in her own Habit before, has provoked me to do
that I fear will blast that good opinion she before had entertained of me


Fear not, Sir, I like you never the worse for what has past, especially
considering who was the cause of your passion, and of whom the discourse was
supposed to be. Like a wise Physician who has made a Patient sick by trying
Experiments, I now will apply that remedy which will, I suppose, reduce you to
your Wits again. Here -- how say you


Gad, now I have you, Madam, hang me if I quit my hold till we are made
Yoak-fellows: and if I trust you more out of my sight --


So; away, and I will follow presently.


Do you know what a dreadful thing it is you go about?


Think not to scare me, Madam; for so long as every couple hitherto, both good
and bad, have had at least a month of pleasure, I am resolved to try what it
is. Madam, it is decreed, and so forth -- Dear Rogue, let us to it. --


HOw, how is this? my Niece with a stranger? undone, undone. Now I begin to
suspect Dashwel is false, and all was true which Mr. Truman told me


My Uncle, Sir! what shall I do?


Fear. nothing, Madam, I will be your shield against his anger.


Niece, Niece, Niece, Baggage, a word I pray -- What Gentleman is that? what,
what have ye been doing together? why don't you answer me? what is he? from
whence? whither would he? with whom would he speak? -- ha --


Why, faith Sir, I am a Cantabrigian, a Gentleman, and my business was with
this Lady; and we have dispatched the very same Affair as you and my Mother
have been about, To have and to hold, for better for worse, and so forth; and
now in hopes you will pardon a wandering Son, Madam, I beg a blessing on this
Lady and my self


How? married, married! Cuds lid married?


Now I am sure this is my young Master Edward; and because he takes me for my
Lady, for once I will act the part of a Mother Edward, you have it; but how
came it to pass you left Cambridge? who gave you leave, pray, to come up to
this lewd Town? go to, it is not well done of you


Widow that was, is this your Son?


Yes, Mr. Docket, and a witty child he is, but much of his Father's resolute
humor, Peace be with him: for if at any time I desired him not to do so, or
so, be sure he would do it; therefore I cannot blame him. But Son, are you
married to that Gentlewoman


As sure as you are to Mr. Docket, Madam.


But not with my consent. However, Sir, for your Mothers sake, who is now my
bride, this likewise being our Weddingday, I pardon you: But do you hear? expect
nothing from me


Lass, Sir, I should be too unreasonable to expect anything from you besides
the Portion her Father left her; Six thousand pounds will satisfy me well
enough


But let me tell you, Sir, she has not Six thousand groats, marrying without my
consent, as by her Father's Will may and does more fully appear


-- Now I have it -- Then, Sir, I hope you will not desire or expect to
intermeddle with my Concerns: I have but Six hundred pounds a year Jointure,
besides Four or Five thousand pounds in Money, Plate, and Goods; but these are
not worth speaking of


How, so wealthy? nay, then I am friends -- It is but three or four years
forbearance, and I shall cheat her of as much as the Portion comes to;
therefore 'twill be policy to comply [ Aside] -- Well, Sir, for your Mothers
sake I am reconciled to you, and must confess --


Six thousand pounds is my Nieces Portion, which in truth I cannot keep from
her, it being by the Will due upon her day of marriage; and my design in
giving out the Penalty, was in hopes that no one would have ventured on her;
and she dying single, her Portion then would have been my own

To which we are Witnesses.


Oh, Mr. Truman! with all my heart.


Brother, give you joy -- Mother, your Blessing


I can hold no longer -- Betty, I am over-joyed to see you in London --


How, how is this? what cheated of my Widow too? Wretched miserable Docket, thou
art undone, undone --


Fear not that, man; she is a thrifty Soul I warrant you. But Docket, could
thou in thy Conscience think it reasonable to swallow Widows as fast as
Mortgages? No, Sir, no; and you see now, that by my own contrivance, without
the help of the Chancery, I have superseded your desires: ha, ha, he --


Look ye, I will instantly draw up an Indictment against ye all for Cheats.


And I will immediately take out a Writ against you for my wifes Portion; you
understand me


But provided you give an Appearance, and put in good Bayl, you shall not be
arrested; for you know Six thousand pounds requires special Bayl, Mr. Docket.
But to prevent such extremity, I will make a bold proposal. -- Deliver up my
Mortgage, and I will become responsible to my friend for your Nieces Portion


Hum! Deliver up your Mortgage, Sir? Curia advisare unit: let me consider on it.


Do it, and I agree to it with all my heart.


Truman, I Will do it; and let all bear witness, I here promise to deliver up Mr.
Truman's Mortgage, provided that upon receipt thereof he enters into Bond to my
Nephew and Niece for the payment of her Portion. In the mean time, Nephew, I
give it you -- And now, Sir, I give you Joy with all my heart


Your Servant, Sir. -- And now, friend, before these, I give you back your
Mortgage in lieu of my Sisters Portion


Well done, in faith, Nephew -- how luckily it falls out! Two Portions paid, and
a Mortgage satisfied, without handling one farthing of Money


Advance, man, and see thy Mistress in earnest, for she is my Master's Wife now.


Married to my Master? I will instantly have him up in the Ecclesiastical Court
de Matrimonio preloquut', for that will amount to a Contract


Spare thy pains, man, he will be too hard for thee at that weapon; and since he
has her, we must submit to our hard fortune


Well, patience per force, et cetera -- but what a Raskal was you to make me
run the Gauntlet about the Town


Hist, hist, Mr. Truman, Mr. Truman --


Your Blessing, Madam.


My Pardon you mean, for making me wait so long.


this Lady, Madam, was pleased to forbid the Banes, and take me her self.


How Is this? my Daughter? Lord, Betty, what make you in London?


Madam, understanding your desire of having me married, I thought London the
likeliest place to meet with a good Husband in, which since I have found true;
and I thank my Stars I am better matched than I should ha'been with Sir
Alexander --


My Son Edward in Town too?


Yes, Madam, and begs both Pardon and blessing; for Mr. Docket's Niece and I
have been at the same sport my Sister and Friend have been at


What a day of Accidents has this been! my Journey made fruitless, my Children
married, and my self disappointed -- But Mr. Truman


I understand you, Madam -- but enough of that -- could you in reason, expect
to have two Husbands before your Daughter had one


This vexes me a little: however, I Will carry it off (...)moothly [ aside.] I
swear, Mr. Truman, you have had singular good fortune, to meet with a Wife; for
could you think I was in (...)arnest? that so Grave and Sober a person as my
self would marry (...)o light a young London gallant as you are? I thought only
to (...)ave made sport with you, and to let you know that Country- Gentlewomen
can carry on designs, and have wit upon occasion, (...)s well as your fine
flanting Londoners, an they list


That I suspected; besides, Madam, I had not the ambition on to be your
Husband; your Son, was the greatest happiness I aimed at -- which, by my
Friends assistance, and this Ladies kind consent, I am according to my wish


I cannot be angry with you; for your marrying my Daughter, shows you have a
Respect for me -- therefore Heaven bless you together; and here I publicly
promise not to marry again -- but be good Children, and when I die, share what
I leave behind me


We are obliged to you.


Frank, suspect me not; thy service shall be rewarded: I hate Ingratitude. --
Find out the man you can like for a Husband, and I promise thee a Portion,
Wench


With your pardon, Madam -- I am of too modish a nature, to comply with so
ungentile a thing as Matrimony: my Request is only this, that you will be pleased
to accept of my service, while I am serviceable; but when I grow old and past
my labor, as they say, a small allowance for Pap, Butter-milk, and roasted
Chestnuts is all I desire


In the mean time, know me for your Gallant; for when that dreadful Winter of
Age comes, you will be good for nothing but to make Touchwood


Mr. Spruce, your Service has been so considerable, that when opportunity
offers, I never will appear ungrateful. --


Your Servant, Sir.


So, so, all is concluded, and I am very well satisfied with my Spouse here,
seeing the Widow has mist of her Aim -- and being my Wedding-night, my Niece
disposed of too -- Dashwel, come hither; run you before to the Rose-Tavern, and
bid 'um send the Supper I bespoke to Cliffords-Inn-Hall; and then step to the
Cock-ale-house and get Fiddles, for I am resolved, Gallants, to dance the
Measures e're I go to bed -- and then --


Aye, marry Sir; shall I see Argulius, and O basse Regis danced again? I love
those Temple-dances with all my heart


Agreed, agreed. --


This Generous Frolic of thine, old Lawyer, has quite reconciled me to thee;
and I am resolved to make Quarrels, but I Will be thy Client for this -- Lead thy
way with thy Duck there --


Aye, aye, let us be going, I begin to grow very sleepy, my Dear.


Gray heads may dote, as their dull Passions move;
But only Heaven and Youth make perfect Love.

THe plague of Writing has infected all;
It Is a Disease grown epidemical,
And not confined to the bounds of this lewd Town,
But over the Nation the Infection's slown.
For Country-Squires now drunken Catches write,
Whilst Miss is here lampoon'd by Iilted Knight.
The brisk gay Fop, and modest Lover too,
With senseless Rimes coy Mistrisses pursue.
Nay, the great man, Heir to more Wealth than Wit,
From Authors steals, yet swears those lines he writ:
But he (suspecting you the cheat should find)
Both to himself, and world, will prove so kind
To let you know in Verse a piece of's mind.
Then blundring through the streams of Poetric
He knowingly displays Debaucherie,
Which proves to be his own Epitomie.
The Zealot too, (as I Am informed) through the Nose
Pronounced a fatal Sentence against Prose:
For being inspired with Brother Hopkins Rhyme,
He wooes a Sister in the like jangling Chime.
Nay, should w'enquire, no doubt there are but few
Amongst ye here, but what are Dablers too;
And Muse as well as Miss for kindness sue.
It is the worlds blind side -- then, Sirs, forbear
Your censures now, lest fondly ye appear,
Not to our Author, but t'your selves severe.
Though plain, it is new, your Rigor then suspend,
Since to divert you this he did intend.
If all should write alike, then where would be
Your blessed Diana, sweet Variety?
