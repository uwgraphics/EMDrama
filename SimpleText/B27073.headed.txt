HAste, Loyal Britons, haste, prepare;
William, Victorious William comes.
Sound, sound ye Trumpets, beat ye Drums;
A Martial Sound best greets a Martial Ear.
Haste, Loyal Britons, haste, prepare;
William Victorious William comes.
How glorious is the Hero's Fate!
As angry Winds increase a Flame,
His Foes but fight to raise his Fame;
And Lewis gained but to make William great.
How glorious is the Hero's Fate!
Lo! Namure, which a Power immense
Outdid it self to conquer and to fence,
Tho thronged with fierce defying Gauls,
To William yields its boasted Walls.
In vain its threatening Champions forward move;
Like Mars He dares, and strikes like Jove.
See! numberless they come, all Gallia takes the Field!
He Looks, They fly; He storms, They yield.
Thus, Peace and Freedom to bestow,
With Thought He orders, and performs with Flame:
Fate by his Prudence takes its Aim,
And by his Valor strikes the Blow.
Proud Lewis, from this Era date thy fall:
He who thus conquered, soon may conquer all;
Yet toyls but for the World's Repose;
And Tyrants are his only Foes.
Hail! Glorious Monarch Britain's Pride,
Europe's Prop the World's Delight!
Thus every year triumphant ride,
Till Peace and Freedom crown thy Right.
