Lo how the trustlesse world the worldlings tosses,
And leads her lovers headlong unto death,
Those that do court her most have maniest crosses,
And yet vain man, this halfe-spent spark of breath,
This dying substance, and this living shadow,
The sport of Fortune, and the spoil of Time,
Who like the glory of a halfe-mow'd meadow
Does flourish now, and strait falls in his prime,
Still toils t'attaine (such is his foolish nature)
A constant good in this inconstant ill:
Unreasonable reasonable creature
That makes his reason subject to his will.
Whilst in the Stage of Contemplation placed
Of worldly humors I behold the strife,
Though different sprites have diverse parts embraced,
All act this transitory Scene of Life:
Of curious minds who can the fancies fetter,
The Soul vnsatisfide, a prey t'each snare,
Still loathing what it has, does dream of better,
Which gotten, but begets a greater care.
And yet all labor for t'attaine the top
Of th'vnsure sovereign bliss that they surmise,
Flowers of Felicity, that few can crop,
Yea, scarce can be discerned by the wise.
Some place their happiness (unhappy beasts,
And I must say, more senseless then their treasures)
In gorgeous garments, and in dainty feasts,
To pamper breath-toss'd flesh with flying pleasures.
Some more austerely with a wrinckled brow
That triumph over their Passions with respects,
With neither fortune moved to brag or bow,
Would make the world enamored of their sects.
Some ravished still with virtues purest springs,
Feed on the Idea of that divine brood,
And search the secrets of celestial things
As most undoubted heirs of that high good.
Thus with conceited ease and certain pain,
All seek by several ways a perfect bliss:
Which, O what wonder, if they not obtain,
Who cannot well discern what thing it is!
What happiness can be imagined here?
Though we our hopes with vain surmises cherish,
Who hardly conquer first what we hold dear,
Then fear to loose it still that once must perish.
Think (though of many thousands scarcely any
Can at this point of Happiness arrive)
Yet if it chance, it chances not to many,
Only to get for what a world did strive.
And though one swim in The Ocean of delights,
Have none above him, and his equals rare,
Ears ioying pleasant sounds; eyes stately sights;
His treasures infinite; his buildings fair.
Yet does the world on Fortunes wheel rely,
Which love's t'aduance the wretched, wrack the great,
Whose course resembles an inconstant eye,
Ever in motion compassing deceat.
Then let the greedy of his substance boast,
Whilst th'excrements of the earth his senses smother,
What has he gayn'd, but what another lost?
And why may not his loss enrich another?
But ah! all loose, who seek to profit thus,
And found their confidence on things that fade,
We may be robbed from them, they robbed from us,
All Is grieved for the one, as for the other glad.
Vain fool, that thinks soliditie to find
In this frail world, where for a while we range,
Which like sea-waues, depending on the wind,
Ebbes, flows, calms, storms, still moving, still in change.
Each surge, we see, does drive the first away,
The foam is whitest, where the Rock is near,
And as one grows, another does decay,
The greatest dangers often do least appear.
Their seeming bliss that trust in frothie shows,
In Fortunes danger, burdened with the Fates,
First to a full, then to confusion grows,
A secret Destiny does guide great States.
But I scorn Fortune, and was ever free
From that dead wealth that wauers in her power,
I bear my treasure still about with me,
Which neither Time nor Tyrants can devour.
Light author of events, and vain aduenters,
Now do thy worst, I know how to undo thee,
The way is stopped by which thy poison enters,
Thou can harm none but them that trust unto thee.
And I have learned to moderate my mind,
Contentment is the crown of my desires:
My clothes are course, my fare such as I find,
He has enough that to no more aspires.
What satisfaction does ouer-flow my soul,
While as I weigh the world which few hold fast,
And in my memories vnblotted scroule,
Judge of the present by the time that is past?
The poore-rich heir of breath that boastes of smoke,
And come of dust, yet of the dross still thinks,
Whilst baser passions do his virtues choke,
The soul ouer-ballanc'd with the body sinkes.
Yet need I not to loathe the world and live,
As one whom stepdame she would never nourish,
I had a part of all that she could give,
My race, my house, by fame and wealth did flourish.
And if that I would vaunt of mine own deeds,
Fair City, where mine eyes first sucked the light,
I challenge might what most thy glory breeds
Whose labors both enlarged thy fame and might.
When Salamina utterly was lost,
And by the rascal multitude neglected,
A counterfeited fool, I went and crossed
All their desseignes, whose courses were suspected.
And when I had by policy persuaded
My country to embrace the wars again,
I both by stratagems and strength invaded
That famous I Will which vanquished did remain.
Then having compassed that exployt with speed,
And turned in triumph decked with strangers spoils,
No perfect bliss below worse did succeed,
The peace that was abroad bred civil broils.
What with more violence does fury lead,
Then a rash multitude that wants a head?
The meaner sort could not their minds conform,
To Abide at what their betters did command:
Then the weale-publike in a dangerous storm,
All joined to place the ruther in my hand.
I reunited that divided state,
And managed matters with a good success,
Which farther kindled had been quenched too late,
That Hidra-headed tumult to suppress.
When I had both these glorious works effected,
And troad the path of sou'raignty a space,
The minion of the people most respected,
None could be great save such as I would grace.
Thus carried with the force of Fortunes stream,
I absolutely acted what I would,
For the Democratie was but a name,
My hand the raines did of the City hold.
I might a Tyrant still have governed so
But my pure soul could no such thought conceive,
And that oversight yet made me never woe,
If I may rule my self it is all I crave.
Yet some that seemed to be more subtile-witted,
Said my base sprite could not aspire t'a crown,
And foolish Solon had a fault committed,
Who would not do the like in every town.
My mind in this a more contentment finds,
Then if a Diadem adorned my brow,
I chain d the affections of undaunted minds,
And made them civil that were wild till now.
I hardly could rich Citizens entise,
To Embrace the statutes that my Laws contained,
What one approou'd another did despise,
Some loved, some loathed, even as they thought they gained.
At last at least in show, all rest content,
Even those that hate me most lend their applause,
A worthy mind needs never to repent
To Have suffered crosses for an honest cause.
I travel now with a contented thought,
The memory of this my fancy feeds,
When all their Empires shall be turned to naught,
Time cannot make a prey of Virtues deeds.
Where seuen-mouth'd Nil from a concealed source
Inunding over the fields, no banckes can bind,
I saw their wonders, heard their wise discourse,
Rare sights enriched mine eyes, rare lights my mind.
And if it were but this, yet this delites,
Behold, how Croesus here the Lidian King,
To be his guest us earnestly inuites,
The which to some would great contentment bring.
But I disdain that world-bewitched man,
Who makes his gold his God, the earth his heaven,
Yet I will try by all the means I can
To make his judgment with his fortune eauen.

What can confine man's wandering thought,
Or satisfy his fancies all?
Is ought so great, but it seems small
To that tos'd spirit, which still af flought
Does dream of things were never wrought,
And would gripe more then it can hold:
This sea-inuiron'd centerd ball
Is not a bound unto that mind,
That mind, which big with monsters,
The right delivery never consters,
And seeking here a solid ease to find,
Would but melt mountains and embrace the wind.
What wonder, though the soul of man,
A spark of heaven, that shines below,
Does labor by all means it can,
It self like to it self to show,
This heavenly essence, heaven would know,
But married with this mass we see,
With pain they spend lives little span,
The better part would be above,
The earth from the earth cannot remove,
How can two contrair's well agree?
Thus as the best or worst part does prevail,
Man is of much, or else of no avail.
O from what source can this proceed,
To Have humors of so many kinds,
Each brain does diverse fancies breed,
All Is many men, all is many minds,
And in the world, a man scarce finds
Another of his humor right,
There are not two so like indeed,
If we remarke their several graces
And lineaments of both their faces,
That can abide the proof of sight:
If the outward forms then differ as they do,
Of force the affections must be different to.
Ah! Passions spoil our better part,
The Soul is vexed with their dissentions;
We make a God of our own heart,
And worship all our vain inventions.
This brain-bred miste of apprehensions*
The mind does with confusion fill,
Whilst reason in exile does smart;
And few are free from this infection,
For all are slaves to some affection,
Which does extorse the senses still.
These partial tirants rage the sight ouersyles,
And does ecclipsie the cleerest judgment whiles.
A thousand times o happy he,
Who does his passions so subdew,
That he may with clear reasons eye,
Their imperfections fountains view,
And as it were himself renew.
If that one might prescribe them laws,
And set his soul from bondage free,
From reason never for to swerue,
And make his passions him to serve,
And be but moved as he had cause:
O greater were that monarch of the mind,
Then if he might command from Thule to Inde.
WHo ever was so favored by the Fates,
As could like us of full contentment boast,
Loved of mine own, and feared of foreign states,
I know not what it is for to be crossed.
No thwarting chance my good hap does importune,
In all attempts my success has been such,
The darling of heaven, the minion of fortune,
I wot not what to wish I have so much.
Mine eyes did never yet dismay my heart
With no delightlesse object that they saw,
My name applauded is in every part
My word an Oracle, my will a Law.
My breast cannot contain this flood of joys
That with a mighty stream o'reflowes my mind,
Which never dreamed of sorrow or annoyes,
But did in all a satisfaction find.
My Soul then be content and take thy pleasure.
And be not vex't with fear of any ill,
My bliss abounds, I cannot count my treasure,
And gold that conquers all, does what I will.

That Grecian (Sir) is at the Court arrived,
Whose wisdom, Fame so prodigally prayse's.

And have you not t'extend my greatness strived,
And entertained his ears with courteous phrases.

I think in all the parts where he has been,
In foreign Countries or his native home,
He never has such stately wonders seen,
As since unto this princely Court he come.
When first he in the regal Palace entered,
As one, who borne amongst the craggie Mountains,
That never for to view the plains aduentred,
Acquainted but with dew and little Fountains:
If he be forced for to frequent the Vailes,
And there the wanton water-Nimphs to see,
The rarenes of the sight so far preuailes,
Each strip appears a flood, each flood a Sea.
So all that he re'ncountred by the way,
Did to his mind a great amazement bring,
The gold-embroidred Gallants made him stay,
Each groom appeared a Prince, each squire a King.
And now he com's t'attaine your Graces sight,
Whom in his mind, no doubt he does adore,
He gazd on those, who held of you their light,
Of force he must admire your self far more.
Now he will set your happy Empire forth,
And be eye-witnes of your glorious Reign,
One wise man's testimony is more worth
Then what a world of others would maintain.

Disdain not (mighty Prince) the loving zeal,
Which a mean man, yet a good mind affords,
And who perchance as much affects your weal,
As those that paint their love with fairer words.

Thy love (sage Greek) is grateful unto us,
Whom Fame long since enamored of thy deeds,
We of thy virtues have heard her discuss,
Who in extolling of the same exceedes.
I wish that many such should here resort,
Whose unstained life would teach us what were best;
Whose grave aspect would grace so great a Court,
And like clear Lamps give light unto the rest.

My Sovereign spare, I merit no such praise,
I am but one that does the world despise,
And would my thoughts to some perfection raise,
A Wisedom-louer that would feign be wise.
Yet with great toil all that I can attain
By long experience, and in learned schools,
Is for to know my knowledge is but vain,
And those that think them wise are greatest fools.

This is the nature of a worthy mind,
It rather would be good then be so thought,
As if it had no aim but Fame to find,
Such as the shadow not the substance sought.
Yet that pursues thee too which thon so fliest,
Still troops applaude thy worth though thou not spy them,
Whilst thou would press it down, it mounts up hiest;
For Fame and Honor follow those that fly them.
And now I think in all the world none liue's,
That better may unfold what I would learn,
Then thou to whom frank Nature largely gives
The grace to see, the judgment to discern.

I Will answer freely to what you propose,
If my small skill can comprehend the sense.

Lo, you have seen in what I most repose
My treasures huge, my great magnificence.

This is the dream of bliss that Fortune brings,
On which the wisest never have presumed
I saw naught but a heap of senseless things,
A momentarie treasure soon consumed.
This only serves the body to decore,
And for corruption framed cannot persevere:
The mind immortal lays up better store
Of vnconsuming joys that last for ever.

I wot not what you mean by such surmises,
And faind Ideaes of imagined bliss,
This portrait of Fancy but intices
Sick brains to dream that which indeed they miss.
But I brook more than their conceits can show,
Whose rich conjectures breed but poor effects:
And I beseeke you, did you ever know
A man more blessed then I in all respects?

Yes, I knew Tellus an Athenian borne,
Whom I hold happy in the first degree:
Who even the harvest of Happiness has shorn,
He lived with fame, and did with honor die.
For having long time lived, loved and respected,
His country in a conflict had the worst:
He come, and there fallen courage re-erected,
And having won the field did die vnforst.
More happy now nor when he was alive;
He dead, does reap the guerdon of his merit,
And in his childern does again revive,
Who all their fathers worthy parts inherit.

Well, since that to a private Citizen
You do ascribe the first most blessed estate.
Now in the second rank of happy men
Whom would you number in your own conceate?

o Cleobis and Biton! now I may
No doubt prefer you next, without reproach,
Their mother chanced on a festival day
To want two horses, for to draw her coach.
Them to supply the place, Love kindly raised,
Who drew her to that place of public mirth,
And both of them exceedingly were praised,
They for their piety, she for her birth.
This charitable office being ended,
Both in the Church were found dead the next morrow,
I think the gods who this good work commended,
Were loath to let them taste of farther sorrow.
For why? our lives are frail, do what we can,
And like the brittle glass, are but a glance,
And often the heavens t'abate the height of man,
Do entersour our sweets with some sad chance.

Then from this Cathagorie am I secluded,
And is my state so vile unto thine eyes,
That as one of all happiness denuded,
Thou thus do my felicity despise?
Or think thou me of judgment too remiss,
A miser that in misery remains,
The bastard child of Fortune, barred from bliss,
Whom heavens do hate, and all the world disdaines?
Are base companions then to be compared
With one that may consume such in his wrath?
Who, as I please, do punish and reward,
Whose words, nay, even whose looks yield life or death.

Sir, be not thus commoo'ud without all reason,
Nor misconceiue my meaning as you do,
Those that speak freely, have no mind of treason,
I cannot be your friend and flatter to.
Unto us Graecians (Sir) the gods have granted
A moderate measure of a humble wit,
And in our Country there have never wanted
Some whom the world for wise men did admit.
And yet amongst us all, the greatest number
Have here dispair'd of any perfect rest,
Though some a while in Fortunes bosom slumber,
And to world-blinded eyes seem to be blessed.
Yet over all mortal states, change so preuailes,
We alterations daily do attend,
And hold this for a ground that never fails,
None should triumph in bliss before the end.
I may compare our state to table-playes,
Where by dumb judges matters are decided,
Their many doubts, the earnest mind dismayes,
The dice must first cast well, then be well guided.
So all our days in doubt what thing may chance us,
Time runs away, the breath of man does chase it,
And when the occasion come's for to advance us,
Amongst a thousand one can scarce embrace it.
When two by generous indignation moved,
Would try by sword, whose glory, fame will smother,
Whilst valor blindly by the event is proved,
And th'ones overthrow can only grace the other.
O what a fool his judgment will commit
To crown the one with undeserved applauses,
Where fortune is for to give sentence yet,
While bloody agents plead such doubtful causes.
This world, it is the field, where each man ventures,
And armed with reason, resolutely goes,
To fight against a thousand misaduentures,
Both with external and internal foes.
And how can he the victors title gain,
That yet is busied with a doubtful fight,
Or he be happy that does still remain
In Fortunes danger for a small delight.
Th'abortiue course of man away fast wears,
Course that consists of hours, hours of a day,
Day that giue's place to night, night full of fears,
Thus all things alter, still all things decay.
Who flourish now in peace, may fall in strife,
And have their fame with infamy suppressed;
The evening shows the day, the death the life;
And many are fortunate, but few are blessed.

I see this Grecian of a simple spirit,
The which is capable of no great things,
Men but advance him far above his merit,
He can not comprehend the States of Kings.
Fame did so largely of his worth report,
It made me long to have him in my house,
But all my expectations are come short,
I think a Mountain has brought forth a mouse.

THis king has put his trust in trustlesse treasures,
Cloi'd with the abundance of all worldy bliss,
And like a hooded hawk gorged with vain pleasures
At randon flies, and wots not where he is.
O how this makes me wonderfully sorry,
To see him keep this lifelesse wealth so straightly,
Whilst witless worldlings wonder at his glory,
Which I not envy, no, but pity greatly!
Thus worms of the earth, whose worst part does prevail,
Love melting things, whose show the body fits,
Where Souls of cleerer sight do never fail
To thesaurize the gifts of gallant wits.
Those worldly things do in this world decay,
Or at the least we leave them with our breath,
Whereas the other makes us live foray,
So differ they as far as life and death.

And yet what wonder though that he be thus,
Whose knowledge clouded is with prosperous winds,
Though this indeed seem somewhat strange to us,
Who have with learning purifide our minds.
Was he not borne heir of a mighty State?
And used with Fortunes smiles, not feared for frowns,
Does measure all things by his own conceate,
Th'infirmitie that fatal is to Crowns:
He has been from his infancy addicted
To all the pompous shows wealth could devise,
And still entreated, never contradicted,
Now does all liberty of speech despise.
Though I durst not so to his fight appear,
Whose corrupt judgment was from reason sweruing,
I grieved to see your entertainment here
So far inferior to your own deserving.
That divine Wisdom which the world admires,
And ravished with delight amazed hears,
Because it answered not his vain desires,
Did seem unsavory to distempered ears:
Ears that are ever stopped to all discourses
Save such as enter fraughted with his praises,
He can love none but them that love his courses,
And thinks all fools that use not flattring phrases.
This wracks the great, and makes the heavens despite them;
Let virtue spread forth all her heavenly powers,
If not in their own livery to delight them,
They will not daigne her audience a few hours.

I care not Aesop how the King conceated
Of my frank speeches, which I ever use,
I came not here, till I was first entreated,
Nor being come, will I my name abuse:
Should I his poisonous Sycophants resemble,
A hateful thing to honest men that know it,
I would not for his Diadem dessemble,
What the heart thinks, the tongue was made to show it.
And what, if his vain humor to have cherished,
I had my speeches for the purpose painted,
I had but gotten gifts that would have perished,
But nothing could have cleared my fame once tainted.
If I had show'n my self toward him officious,
It would in end have but procured my shame:
To have our virtue praised by one that is vicious,
This in effect is but a secret blame.
He thinks him simple, who his anger raises,
But better simply good, then doubly ill;
I never value my worth by others praises,
Nor by opinions do direct my will.
And it content's me more to be applauded
By one of judgment (though of mean degree)
Then by a Prince of princely parts defrauded,
Who has more wealth, but not more wit then he.

Who come to Court, must with Kings faults comport.

Who come to Court, should truth to Kings report.

A wise man at their imperfections winks.

An honest man will tell them what he thinks.

So should you loose your self, and them not win.

But I would bear no burden of their sin.

By this you should their indignation find.

Yet have the warrant of a worthy mind.

It would be long, ere you were thus preferred.

Then it should be the King not I that er'd.

They guerdon as they love, they love by guess.

They guerdon as they love, they love by guess.

Yet when I merit well, I care the less.

It Is good to be still by the Prince approved.

It Is better to be upright, though not loved.

But by this mean, all hope of Honor fails.

Yet honesty in end ever preuailes.

I think they should excel as often they do
All men in wit, that unto men give laws:
Kings are the Center of the Kingdom, to
The which each weighty thing by nature draws:
For as the mighty Rivers, little streams,
And all the liquid powers that rise or fall,
Do seek in sundry parts by several seames
To the maine Ocean that receiue's them all.
Who as he were but steward of those waters
Returne's them back by many secret veins,
And as the earth has need of moisture, scatters
His humid treasures to refresh the plains.
So are Kings breasts the depth where daily flows
Clear streams of knowledge with rare treasures charged,
And thus continually their wisdom grows
By many helps that others want enlarged.
For those that have intelligence over all,
Do commonly communicate to Kings
All th'accidents of weight that chance to fall,
Their greatness to them this advantage brings.
They being jealous find out many drifts,
And by a long experience learn to scance them,
Then those whom Art or Nature lend's great gifts,
All come to Kings as who may best advance them.
No doubt, those Powers who put them in their places
To make their qualities with their charge even,
Do dote them with some supernatural graces,
Vice-gods on the earth, great Lieutenants of heaven.

As you have shown, Kings have a good occasion
Whereby t'attaine unto the height of wit.
Which whosoever do embrace by good persuasion,
Are surely worthy on a Throne to sit.
But ah! those Rivers are not ever pure
The which through tainted channels whiles conuaid,
Vile flatt'ries poison rendered has impure.
Thus are Kings hearts often by their ears betrayed.
For impudent effronted persons dare
Court with vain words and detestable lies,
Whilst purer sprited men must stand afar,
The light is loathsome to diseased eyes.
But this does ravish often my soul with wonder,
Some that are wise, with flattery can comport,
And though of all men best men's parts they ponder,
Yet ever entertain the baddest sort.
Is It that such men as those cannot controlle them,
Nor never cross their appetite in ought,
But for each purpose that they speak extolle them,
Where better wits would argue as they thought,
Or as they would have none for to resist them,
So for th'aduancement of the worthiest sorry,
They will have none that may seem to assist them,
Lest any challenge intrest in their glory.
This selfe-conceate is a most dangerous shelfe,
Where many have made shipwreck unawares:
He that does trust too much unto himself,
Can never fail to fall in many snares.
Of all that live, great Monarchs have most need
To balance all their actions, and their words,
And with advise in all things to proceed:
A faithful Counsel often great good affoordes.
Lo, how th'inferior Spears their courses bend
There, whither the first Moouer does them drive:
The Commons customs on the Prince depend,
His manners are the rules by which they live.
No man is only for himself brought forth,
And Kings for the use of many are ordaind,
They should like Suns, clear Kingdoms with their worth,
Whose life a pattern must be kept unstained.
Those that are virtuous have an ample field
To Express their wisdom and t'extend their merit,
Where mean men must to their misfortune yield,
Whilst lack of power does burst a gallant spirit.
As precious Stones are th'ornaments of rings,
The Stone decores the ring, the ring the hand:
So Countries are conform unto their Kings,
The King decores the Court, the Court the Land.
And as a drop of poison spent alone,
The Infected fountain does with venom fill,
So mighty States may be orethrowne by one;
A vicious Prince is a contagious ill.

This is an easy thing, for us to spy
And paint in the air the shadows of our minds,
And t'apprehend with th'intellectuall eye;
A blessing that no worldly Kingdom finds.

I grant imaginary grounds of ours
Will never move a world-bewitched Prince,
To disenchaunt himself, and spend some howrs
His own disseignes of folly to convince.
Ere Croesus can refrain from this his fury,
He must forsake himself, and be renewed,
And in the Lethe of oblivion bury
The vanities that have his soul subdewd.
He first must his prerogatives al smother,
And be a man, a man to be controld,
Then all his faults as they were in another
Like an impartial Arbiter behold.
Could he cast off this veil of fond self-love,
Through which all things not as they are he spies,
He would those wicked Parasites remove,
Vile instruments of shame that live by lies.
And the only means to force them to depart,
That he might judge more freely of his state,
Were to cast out the Idol of his heart
Which puffs him up with a pride-swolne conceate.
For foreign flatterers could not find access,
Were not ouer-valuing his own worth too much,
He flattred first himself and thinks no less
But all their praises ought for to be such.
And when these hireling Sycophants have found
A Prince whose judgment selfe-conceat disarmes,
They breach his weakest part, and bring to ground
The greatness of his State with flatteries charms.
Then bearing over his Passions once the sway,
Least by the better sort he be aduisd,
To wholesome counsel they close up the way,
And use all means to have honest men despisd.

If you at Court to credit would arise,
You must not seek by truth t'acquire renown,
But learn t'applaud whiles what you most despise,
And smile in show, whilst in effect you frown.

From Court in time I will my self retire,
I find my humor is not fit for Court.
I Am none of those whom Croesus does desire,
I can not always of his worth report.
O that he cannot see light Fortune flout him
While as he glories in this outward show,
Hedged in with greedy Harpies round about him,
That gape to enrich themselves with his overthrow.

OF all the creatures below
We must call Man most miserable,
Who all his time is never able
T'attaine unto a true repose,
His very birth may well disclose
What miseries his bliss overthrow,
For being borne he can not know
Who to his state is friend or fo.
Nor how at first for to stand stable,
But even with cries and tears does show
What dangers do his life enclose,
Whose griefs are sure, whose joys a fable?
Thus still his days in dolor so
He to all perils must expose,
And with vexation lives, and dies with woe,
Not knowing whence he come nor where to go.
While as he brooks this lowest place,
O how uncertain is his state,
Which gouernd by a secret fate
Is subject to inconstancy,
And ever changing as we see
Is still in toil, never in peace.
For if man prosper but a space,
With each good success too too bold,
And puffed up in his own conceit,
He but abuses Fortunes grace:
And when that with adversity
His pleasures come to end their date,
And with disasters are controld,
Straight he begins for grief to die:
And still the top of some extreme does hold,
Not suffering summers heat, nor winters cold.
His state does in most danger stand
That most abounds in worldly things,
And soars too hie with Fortunes wings,
Which carry up aspiring minds
For to be beaten with all winds,
The course of such being rightly scand,
Whilst men can not themselves command
Transported with a pow'rles name,
Often unexpected ruin brings.
W' have seen examples in this land,
How worldly bliss the senses blindes,
And on a reed vnsurely hings,
He that presumes upon the same
Hid poison in his pleasure finds,
And sailing rashly with the winds of fame,
Does often times sink into a sea of shame.
It Is to be feared our King at last
Whilst he for nothing is afraid,
Be by prosperity betrayed,
For growing thus in greatness still,
And having worldly things at will,
He thinks though Time should all things wast,
Yet his estate shall ever last,
The wonder of the inferior round,
And in his own conceit has said,
No course of heaven his state can cast,
Nor make his success to be ill;
If Fortune once those thoughts t'obbraid
Will have our King to be vn-cround,
She may that mind with horror fill,
And in an instant utterly confound
The state, that stands upon so slipprie ground,
When such a Monarchs mind is bent
To follow most the most unwise,
Who can their folly disaguise
With sugared speeches poisonous baits,
The secret canker of great states,
From which at first few disassent,
The which at last all do repent,
While as repenting lust must go,
When Kings begin for to despise
Of honest men the good intent,
Who to assure their Sovereigns seats,
Would feign in time some help devise,
And would cut off all cause of woe,
Yet can not second their conceats,
These dreadful Comets commonly forgo
The Kings destruction that is miscarried so.
WHat uncouth fancies do affright my soul,
And have captived it to a thousand fears?
Strange cares suggesting grief my joys control,
My mind some coming evil charactred bears,
And credulous suspicion too too wise,
To fortify my fears does means invent,
Whilst sudden terrors do my sprite surprise,
An ominous presage of some bad event.
I think the soul come of immortal brood
As being partner of a divine power
Has a foreknowledge both of evil and good,
Although she can not fly a fatal hour.
Though with this mortal veil being made half blind,
She can not soar outright with her own wings,
Yet she communicates unto the mind
In cloudie dreams and mysteries strange things.
Th'imagination wonderful in force
Of foiles the judgment with confusion so,
That presupposing all things to be worse
Then they fall forth, we double our own woe.
For as the shadow seems more monstrous still
Then does the substance whence it has the being,
So th'apprehension of approaching ill
Seems greater then it self, whilst fears are lying.
This alteration too seems more then strange,
Which at an instant has ore-whelm'd my senses,
I see (more then I thought) all states may change,
Against the heaven the earth can find no defenses.
My soul her wonted pleasure else is loathing,
This has indeed so deep impression left,
A dream, a fantasy, a shadow, nothing
Has all my mirth even in a moment reft.

Whence (mighty Sovereign) can this change proceed,
That does obscure the rays of princely grace,
Those that are schoold in woe may clearly reed,
A mighty passion written in your face.
And if a stranger may presume so far,
I would the copy of your passions borrow,
I else conjecture in what state you are,
Taught by a secret sympathy in sorrow.
Two strings in diverse Lutes set in accord,
(Although the one be but touched) together sound,
Even so souls tuned to grief the like afford,
And other with a mutual motion wound.

No doubt but it disburdens much the mind,
A Secretary in distress to have,
Who by his own another grief can find,
Where glad minds scorn what they can not conceive.
And I (Adrastus) would the cause declare
With which I so torment my self in vain,
O but I blush t'vnfold my foolish care,
It Is but th'illusion of a drowsy brain.

According to the bodies constitution,
The soul by night with fancies is afflicted,
Or by these thoughts continual revolution,
To which by day the mind is most addicted.

Now whilst the Sun did peep through Thetis bower,
And on the beauties of Aurora gazed,
Out of my body spoild of moving power,
All faculties of life dull sleep had razed,
While as the sprite more powerful then ever
Since least impeached with this earthly part
The verity from lies could best disseuer
Hid mysteries vnclouding to the heart.
I only have two sons, and the one you see
The sign of Natures indignation bears,
And from his birth day domme is dead to me,
Since he can power no pleasure in my ears.
The other Atis all my life's delight,
In whom the treasures of my soul are kept,
I thought (vain be my thought) in the twie-light
I wot not whether yet I walked or slept.
Whilst he was sporting void of worldly cares,
Not in a lists belonging to his merits,
A pointed tool of iron fell unawares,
And pearc'd his temples, and expeld his spirits.
Whilst the pale carcass seemed t'vpbraid mine eyes,
The horror of the sight my sense recald,
Which when I think of, yet my comfort dies,
Such an exceeding fear my sprit appald.
This has me moved, it touched my state so neerelie,
To match my son in marriage at this time
With beauteous Caelia whom he loved most dearly,
That both might reap the pleasure of their prime.
And if the heavens his overthrow have decreed
By destiny that can not be revoked,
So shall we have behind some of his seed,
Ere in his blossom all our hopes be choked.
Thus ere his soul lodge in the lightlesse shade,
To Have of his race twill mitigate my mind,
I can not hold him altogether dead,
That leaves his Image in some one behind.
And for the time we do all that seems best
For to prevent those but surmiz'd annoyes,
Yet for all this my mind has never rest,
Some secret terror still disturbs my joys.

Ah Sir! if but th'imagind evil of this
Has plunged your soul in such a gulf of grief,
Unhappy I who wail a thing that is,
And have not means to hope for no relief.
If all these dreadful fancies took effect
(Which heavy chance the almighty Jove withhold)
It could not be compared in no respect
With those misfortunes that my state enfold.
For when your son fell by another hand,
You should but wail his death, and not your crime,
The heavens of me my brothers blood demand,
His fate, my fault, mourn must I all my time.

In what strange form could this disaster fall,
That is the occasion of so great distress,
Tell on at length the original of all,
To hear of greater grief it will make mine less.

I have conceald my sorrows still till now,
As too offensive food for dainty ears,
Yet since of such a subject you allow,
I Will tell a tale that may move stones to tears.
My Father of the Phrigian Princes come,
Had in my growing age a tender care,
That all my education might become
One whom he might for mighty hopes prepare:
As yet four lusters scarcely had begun
For to discern my sex with downie cheeks,
When I into that Labirinth was run,
Whence back in vain the straying entrer sheekes.
I loved, O fatal love! unlovely fate,
The virtuously fair, yet fairest Dame
That ever was enshrined in souls conceat,
Or gave a dittie to the sounds of fame.
Straight were my fancies to her beauties tied,
None can paint passions but in feeling minds,
I burnd, freezd, hopd, dispaird, and liud, and dyed,
My actions changed as often as the Autumnes winds.
Yet after many doubtful hopes and fears
That I attaind the height of my desires,
She had subscribed a truce unto my tears,
And temperd with encountering flames my fires.
For as she was the most affected Saint,
Whose image was erected in my thought,
She had compassion too of my complaint,
And to acquit my firm affection sought.
Thus whilst I triumphd in mine own conceat,
As one whose love his Lady did prefer,
I was corriuald (O unhappy fate!)
By one who loved, but was not loved by her.
He looking as I looked, saw what I saw,
Saw Natures wonder, and the worlds delight:
And as a blind god blind guide did him draw
Still like a lizard lived but by her sight.
Then strait he strives the Jewel for to won,
Whose unstained worth he rates above his breath,
He hates the light that comes not from my Sun,
And thinks to live without her worse then death.
And this affection favored was by Fortune
Which seemed to ratify his high reared hopes,
The Nymph her parents daily did importune,
For to confine his flying fancies scopes.
Now judge if that my miseries were rife,
Who threatened thus with eminent mishap,
Was like to lose a deerer thing then life,
Whilst others strived my treasure to entrap.
The man that sought my joys to undermine,
I could not wish for this to have him overthrown,
Nor blame the sprite that sympathiz'd with mine,
I envied not his hap, but wail'd mine own.
Now in my breast a battle did begin,
Which forced my soul with inward wounds to bleed,
Some fancies feared to what his love might win,
And possibility for to come speed.
Then others called her constancy to mind,
Which would not yield although she were invaded,
Yet forced to fear the frailty of her kind.
A woman that has ears may be persuaded.
Thus tossed with doubts into a deep of woe,
Which with suspicion had my joys supplanted,
I blamed the thoughts that durst accuse her so,
As virtues pattern had one virtue wanted.
As I concluded, so it come to pass,
Th'affliction served for fuel to affection,
For she who th'ornament of women was,
Would never wrong her worth with a defection.
When in my absence they had often assayed
To have me from her memory removed,
The Sun burn's hottest when his beams are stayed,
The more that they would let, the more she loved.
And finding that delay no end affords,
And that fair generals are th'abusers Art,
She did repel him with disdainful words
To raze all thought of her out of his heart.
Love is a joy that upon pain depends,
A drop of sweet drowned in a sea of sowres,
What Folly does begin, often Fury ends,
They hate for ever, that have loved for hours.
When all his arguments proved of no force,
Strait with disdain his soul in secret bur'nd,
And what he thought was evil, to make far worse,
He unto furour all his favor turned.
As he extremely loved, far more he hated,
And musde of many means how to annoy her,
Which was the best a long time he debated,
To see her dead, or to see me enjoy her.
What? says he when he first had musde a space,
So hard it is to quench a great affection:
Shall I disfigure that angelike face,
And make the world ecclypsde of all perfection?
Shall she by me be to confusion brought,
To whom I vows and prayers did impart,
To whom I sacrificed my secret thought,
And on her beauties altar burned my heart?
Or shall I see her in another power,
And in his bosom lie t'vpbraid my loss,
Whilst both with scornful smiles then death more sour,
To point me out for sport report my cross?
That sight which sometime did me sweetly charm,
Should it become a cause of grief to me?
No, none that liue's, shall glory in my harm,
Since she will not be mine, she shall not be.
Th'unlouing Lover having vowed her death,
Did with a cup of poison drown my joys.
The fairest body from the sweetest breath
Was parted thus, (O Ocean of annoyes!)
That Monster Fame, whose many mouths and ears
Must know, but not conceal a rare thing long,
And prodigal of ill, most chiefly bears
The worst news first, informed me of this wrong.
For neighboring near the most unhappy part
That had been spoild of such a beeauteous guest,
No sooner had death seazde on the chaste heart
Then sorrow on my ears to rob my rest.
How the sad news first sounded in my soul,
I will not weary you with long laments,
Rage did the outward signs of grief control;
When great winds blow the fire, the smoke worst vents.
Whilst generous disdain disguisde my grief,
(As one transported with a mighty rage)
I ran unto the Theater of mischief,
A tragic Actor for a bloody stage.
For I was come no sooner to the place
Whereas I thought the Murderer to have found,
But I re'ncountred (O unhappy case)
Too dear a friend to catch an enemies wound.
Ah passions! dimmed mine eyes, wrath led my hand,
I was no more my self, sorrow had killed me,
The first (it was night) that did before me stand,
I fiercely did pursue, as Furor willd me.
And as it chanced, ere one could speak a word,
I filld his bosom with a luke warm flood,
And in his kind breast drowned the cruel sword,
That in another body drank my blood.
When as a Torch had partly robde the night,
Proud of supposde revenge (ah bitter gain)
I saw, I knew, black knowledge, cruel sight,
It Was mine own brother that my self had slain.
O bitter loss that nothing can repair!
My soul at once with all woes army wounded,
Grief, rage, spite, shame, amazement and despair,
Gauld, tossd, burnd, dashd, astonishd, and confounded.
The thought of my offense torments me most,
Yet am I whiles by my Loves verdict cleansde,
And whiles my brothers violated ghost
By dreadful dreams does boast to be reuengde.

Now whilst this great disaster did occur,
What came of him who was the cause of all?

He having heard this lamentable stir,
Whom selfe-accusing thoughts did guilty call,
Srait stricken with a wonderful remorse,
I wot not whether fear or pity moved him,
If not t'ore-liue her death, or dreading worse,
He killd himself, his conscience so disproou'd him.

I grant the manner of so rare mischances
Would force compossion from your greatest foe,
Where all the griefe-begetting circumstances
Do join to make a harmony in woe.
But natural love does at our self begin,
It mooues far more to feel then hear mishaps,
The perturbation that my sprite is in,
Me in a maze of miscontentments wraps.
We should such past misfortunes pretermit,
At least no more immoderately lament them,
And as for those which are but coming yet,
Use ordinary means for to prevent them.

No wonder Sir, although you take great care,
Lest all your hopes in Atis person perish.

I will by all the means I may, prepare
To save his youth, that he my age may cherish.
If it be possible for mortal states
To strive against the Stars and be more strong,
I Will unarm Fortune, and resist the fates,
By barring both all means to do me wrong.
I have commanded under pain of death,
That no such weapon be within my walls,
As I supposed should have abridg'd his breath,
T'eschew such sudden evil as rashly falls.
He shall go rarely to the fields, and then
With chosen bands be guarded all the time:
Lo where he communes with some contrymen,
We will go try what they would have of him.

Lend (Sir) a willing ear to humble words,
Let not our baseness bar us from your grace,
Which still it self alike to all affords
Who bless their sight with that Maiestike face.
My Sovereign all his subjects well remembers,
As vile as our estate is thought of now
You are our head, and we are of your members,
And you must care for us, we care for you.
Our poverty to us is no reproach,
Which th'innocencie of our mind adorn's,
We never on our neighbors bounds encroach,
But by our labors live midst many thorns.
And ever busied for the Countries good,
We have no time to muse of vain conceates,
Yet earning with continual toil our food
We entertain the pomp of prowder States.
And (Sir) conceive not of our meaning ill,
That thus dare speak so freely as we do,
Whilst mediators do dilate our will
They wrest it as they will, and wrack us too.
To countenance such as us you need not shun,
A great man too well graced may do more harm:
And it is no stain unto the glorious Sun,
Though often his beams an abject object warm.
Be not discouraged by your base estate,
Ye are my people, and I Will hear your plaint,
A King must care for all, both small and great,
And for to help the afflicted never faint.
The Scepter such as these should chiefly shroud,
Not cotages, but Castles spoil the Land,
T'aduance the humble and t'abate the proud;
This is a Virtue that makes Kings to stand.

Sir, our estate some speedy help requires,
In Misia near unto the famous Mountain
Of great Olimpus that the World admires,
There haunt's a Boar by Dianaes Fountain
Of a big body, and a hideous form,
His fomie Iawe with tuskes like Iauelins strikes,
And all parts in deformity conform,
His back has bristles like to iron Pikes.
This Monster of Nature, wonder of Men,
The Forests tyran, and the Countries terror,
Tears all to death, and draws them to his Den,
That chance into his way by fatal error.
Whilst tenderhearted Mothers do bewail
The goared Infants toyling in their blood,
Th'abhominable beast them does assail,
And in his bowels buries both for food.
Then when we fly the field where he soiournes,
To have his hunger or his rage alayde,
He wastes the fruits, and ruins all the corns,
Thus the poor husbands hopes are all betrayde.
Ere this, of true Repose we were the types,
And pastur'd on each plain our fleecie flocks,
And made a consort of our warbling pypes,
With moving christals the issue of the rocks.
And sometime to refresh us after travel,
With flowrie garlands shielded from Sunne-beames
We gazd upon Pactolus golden gravel,
Glassd, bathd, and quenchd our thirst with his pure streams:
Whilst we preferred, the River seemd amazd,
Unto his golden bed, his grassye bancke,
And lay and lookd whereas our cattle grazd,
Without all envy of a greater rank.
That to repress oppression you take care,
This rest of ours is an effectual token,
Your Laws like Spiders webs do not ensnare
The feeble flies, and by the Bees are broken.
For we by them are fenced from great men's pride,
The Heavens perpetuate your prosperous reign,
And suffer not this savage Boar to abide,
To turn that ease which men have spared to pain.

What would ye then, that should be done by me?
For to repay your loss; repair this wrong.

We crave none of your wealth, yet wish to see
This Boar be-blood the staff of the most strong:
Let valorous Atis worthily your son,
Backd with the best of all the Lidian Youth,
Go to the fields before the rising Sun
Quench with the mornings tears his mid-dayes drouth,
And we shall lead them crowned with laurel forth,
Where in a circuit small, yet a large Theater
For men to make a trial of their worth
This Monster stays: the earth never nurc'd a greater.
So shall we both reap profit, and they pleasure,
Which may be brought to pass without great obstacle,
By making this waster of the worlds treasure,
Of a horrid sight, a delightful spectacle.

I may not spare my Son for a respect,
Which is not needful now for to be known,
But I Will send others for the same effect,
That this pestiferous Beast may be o'rethrowne.
Th'ostentiue gallants that our Grace attend,
And wait the occasion but t'aduance their strength,
Against the Boar shall all their forces bend,
With hounds and darts still till he fall at length.
I swear this Monster shall when he is dead,
A memorable monument remain,
To Dians Church I Will consecrate his head,
The Virgin-goddesse darts no shaft in vain.

Ah wherein Father have I thus offended!
Or what vile sign of a degenerd mind
Have you remarked in me that ever tended
To the reproach of our Imperial kind?
That of this praise you would give me no part,
But bar me from a famous enterprise,
As one unworthy for to weeld a dart:
Who still in vile repose inglorious lies,
Lies like a wanton with vain thoughts bewitchd,
Who spoyld of force effeminately lives,
A Peacocke but with painted pens enrichd,
Yet poor in all the parts that Glory gives.
What glory gives those glorious Styles to me
Which by succession fall, not by desert,
Should but my Fame with borrowd feathers flee;
For come of Kings a kingdom is my part.
Who only by his Birth advancement claims,
Like a base bastard does his birthright blote,
I will not beg my worth from dead men's names,
Nor conquer Credit only by my Cote.
What comforts this to brook The Imperial seat,
And all the bliss that Majesty impartes?
If those whom only we exceed in State,
Be our Superiors in far better parts.
More then a Crown true Worth is to be valued,
The One Fortunes gift, and the other our own merit,
By which often times the afflicted Mind is salued,
When Fortune takes what we by her inherit.

I see what brave Desires boil in thy Soul,
And make thee with immortal wings to flee,
This hie-bent courage, nothing can control,
All Lidia is not large euough for thee.
Go, seek an Empire equal with thy mind,
No common limits can confine thy thought;
But while a full perfection thou would find,
I fear thy fall turn all our hopes to naught.
And pardon me, (dear Son) it is a great Love
That makes me watch so warily over thy ways,
The Affection of a Father what may move,
Whom such an eminent danger not dismayes?
The Heavens of late aduertisde me by Dream,
That some sad fortune did attend thy Youth,
New Meteors and strange Stars through the air still stream,
Which are as Oracles of Jove's own mouth.
This was the cause that hastened Us so much
To have thee bound to Himens hallowed Law,
This was the cause that all our care was such,
Out of our sight all weapons to withdraw.
Scorn not th'amazing Comets that thou notes,
The Stars to mortal States have terms prefixed,
And think not only that my love but dotes,
For if thou fall, my fate with thine is mixed.

Would God I had some means once ere my death
To satisfy that infinite desert;
Which I shall hold so long as I have breath,
Deep registered with reu'rence in my heart.
Yet (Sir) we see it is a natural thing
For too excessive love t'engender fears,
A sport like this can no great peril bring
Where either all delights the eyes or the ears.
If from my former deeds I now should shrink,
As void of virtue to soft pleasure thrall,
Of your two Sons what might your subjects think,
The One wanting but one sense, and the other all.
What fancies might my late spousd love possess,
To see her husband hateful in their sights?
And from the height of Honor to digress,
To womanize with courtly vain delights:
Though women love to have men at their devotion,
They hate base minds that hatch no noble motion.

Well, well, my Son, I see thou must prevail,
Go follow forth the chase, use thine own will,
Yet stay, or let my words thus much avail,
Walk warily now t'eschue this threatened ill.
Thy hautie sprite t'attempt all hazards bent,
I fear transport thee to a fatal strife,
(God grant I be deceau'd) yet take good tent,
Thy ouer-franke courage may betray thy life.
And (dear Adrastus,) I must let him know
What benefits I have bestowed on thee,
Not to vpbraid thee, no, but for to show
How I may trust thee best that is bound to me.
When thou from Phrigia come defild with blood,
And a fraternall violated love:
When in a most extreme estate thou stood,
Chased from thy fathers face, cursed from above.
Thou found me friendly, and my Court thy rest,
A Sanctuary sacred for thy safety,
Where thou wast entertained as pleased thee best,
I think those dangers escaped should make thee crafty.
Yet though I graced thee erst, it was but a sign
Of a heroic mind that helps the wretched:
But in thy hands my soul i will now consigne,
And give a proof of love not to be matched.
Behold how Atis of our age the shield,
Whose harm as you have heard I feared ere now,
Is to go take his pastime in the field,
And with his custody i will credit you.
I must my friend even fervently exhort,
Wait on my son, remember of my dream,
This dangerously delectable sport,
Does make me fear the grief exceed the game.

I never shall those courtesies neglect,
It irkes me not to think nor hear the same:
For while this sprite these members does direct,
All shall concur to celebrate your fame.
If it were your will I would not hence depart,
Who all such motives unto mirth abhore,
But with my passions here, retird apart,
Would wail woe past and shun all cause of more.
For if I strive t'abandon my annoyes,
I fear my fellowship infect with woe:
Those that would recreat themselves with joys,
Still strange mishaps attend me where I go.
Yet since you will commit this charge to me,
I Will use all means that you may not repent you,
At lest all my defects faith shall supply,
I covet nothing more then to content you.

Now for to see this monsters ouglie shape,
With an enflamed desire my thoughts do burn,
And Father, be not feared for no mishap,
I hope soon, and victorious to return.

Return? and whither love? O deadly word!
That does import thy parting from my sight,
I heard thee name, mishap, ah my dear Lord!
Should such strict limits bound so large delight?
O cruel resolution, unkind dealing,
And can thou condescend to leave me so?
Or from my presence privily thus stealing,
Think thou to rob a portion of my woe?
This might indeed to thee yield some relief,
To have thy ears not wounded with my moan,
But would wound me with a continual grief.
To fear all things where I should fear but one.
Desist in time from this intended strife,
With which thy thoughts have vnaduisdlie entered,
Remember I have interest in thy life,
Which I consent not to be thus aduentred.
Have thou not given a proof in thy green prime,
That may content the most ambitious hopes,
Whilst Atis was his own, O then it was time
To follow fancies vnconfined scopes.
Thy self then only camp'd in Fortunes bounds,
Thou do endanger Caelia likewise now,
You sigh her breath, she suffer's in your wounds:
You live in her, and she must dye in you.

Life of my soul, how do such broken speeches
From confusde passions thus abruptly rise?
I know my love, thy love my mind o're-reaches,
Affection schoold with fears is too too wise.
I go o're-thwart the fields for sport to range,
Thy sighs do but my soul with sorrow fill,
And pardon (dear) I find this wondrous strange,
Thou never did till now resist my will.
If I trespass in aught against my duty,
Which makes thee thus my faith for to mistrust,
Mistrust not yet the chains of thine own beauty,
Which bind all my desires and so they must.
Are we not now made one such fears overcome,
Though I would fly my self my self do fetter,
And if that I would fly, from whom? to whom?
I can love none so well, none loves me better.
Have pity of those peareles (sweet eyes souls pleasures)
Lest they presage what thou would not have done,
The heavens had not given me those precious treasures
Of such perfections to be spoiled so soon.

THose that domine above,
High presidents of heaven,
By whom all things do move
As they have order given:
What worldling can arise
Against them to repine?
Whilst castel'd in the skies
With providence divine
They force th'inferior round
Their judgments to confess,
And in their wrath confound
Proud mortals that transgress
The covenant they made
With Nature in heavens stead.
Base brood of earth, vain man,
Why bragst thou of thy might?
The heavens thy courses scan,
Thou walkst still in their sight,
Ere thou wast borne, thy deeds
Their registers dilate,
And think that none exceedes
The compass of his fate.
What heavens would have thee to
Though they thy ways abhor,
That thou of force must do,
And thou may do no more.
This reason would fulfill,
Their work should serve their will.
Are we not heirs of death,
In whom there is no trust,
Who tossd with circkling breath,
Are but a dram of dust?
Yet fools when as we err
And do th'heauens wrath contract,
If they a while defer
A just revenge t'exact,
Pride in our bosom creepes,
And mis-informes us thus,
That the Eternal sleeps,
Or takes no care of us.
No, the eye of heaven beholds
All what our heart enfolds.
The gods digest no crime
Though they continue long,
And in th'offenders time
Seem to neglect their wrong,
Till others of their race
Fill up the cup of wrath,
Whom ruin and disgrace
Long time attended has,
And Giges fault we fear
To Croesus charge be laid,
Which love will not forbear
Though it be long delayed:
For o sometime the gods
Must plague sin with sharp rods.
And lo how Croesus still
Tormented in his mind,
Like a reed on a hill,
Is shiuering with each wind.
Each step a terror brings,
Dreams do by night afflict him,
And by day many things,
All his thoughts do convict him:
He his star would control,
This makes evil not the worst
Whilst he wounds his own soul
With th'apprehension frist:
Man may his fate foresee,
But not shun heavens decree.
CAn heaven behold hands staind with blood ofttimes,
And to the Stigian streams not headlongs hurld?
Can the earth support one burdened with such crimes,
As may provoke the wrath of all the world?
Why sends not Jove to have my curss'd course confind,
A death-denouncing flash of rumbling thunder,
Or a tempestuous terrour-breeding wind,
With violence to tear me all asunder.
What unknown corner from the world removed
T'inhabit in th'horizon of despair
Shall I go now possess and be approved
By monsters like my self that hate repair.
I Will go indeed whom all the world detests,
Who have no interest in the fields of bliss,
And barbarize among the barbarous beasts,
Where Tigers rage, Toades spue, and Serpents hiss.
Yet though both th'Artike and Antartike Pole
I should ouerpasse, and find th'vnpeopled zones,
A wilderness where naught were to control
My damnable cruelties but trees and stones:
Yet of my deeds which all the world do tell,
All this could not deface th'infamous scroule,
Within my breast I bear about my hell,
And can not escape the horrors of my soul.
Those fearful monsters of confusd aspects,
Chimera, Gorgon, Hydra, hellish apes,
Which in the world wrought wonderful effects,
And borrowed from the infernal shades their shapes.
Their deuilish forms that did the world amaze,
Not half so monstrous as my self I find,
When on mine own deformities I gaze,
In the black depth of a polluted mind.
No, but my mind untainted still remains,
My thoughts in this dilict have had no part,
Which accidentally this foul fact stains,
My hands had no commission of my heart.
Yet, whether it was fortune or my fate,
Or some hell-hag that did direct my arm,
I quaild the Lidians hopes abortiue date,
And am the instrument of all their harm.
Then swelling mountains come and fall upon me,
Your height may hide me from the wrath of heaven:
But this needs not, my fault has else undone me,
No torment can with my offense be even.
Ah of what desert shall I now make choice,
T'auoid the countenance of an angry King?
I know th'auenging sword of Croesus voice,
To wound my soul hosts of rebukes does bring.
No, th'obiect of distress i will stand alone,
A memorable monster of mishap,
For though Pandoraes plagues were poured in one,
All were too few so vile a wretch t'entrap.
O how the King is moved with Atis death,
His face the impression of a passion bears
With bended eyes, crostarmes, and quiuering breath,
His princely roabe he desperately tears.
Lo, with a silent pittie-pleading look,
Which shows with sorrow mixed a high disdeine,
He whilst his soul seems to dissolve in smoke,
Whiles eyes the corpse whiles him by whom it is slain.

Thou ruthlesse Tyrant, ruin of my bliss,
And did thou so disguise thy deuilish nature
To recompense my courtesies with this?
Ah cruel wretch, abominable creature.
Thy Tigrish mind who could have well detected?
In mortal breasts so great barbaritie?
What forward sprite could have such spite suspected?
In hospitality hostility?
Did I revive thee when thy hopes were dead,
When as thy life thy parents had not spared?
And having heapt such favors on thy head,
Is this? Is this?

he would say the reward.


I grant what you allege, and more, is true,
I have unto the height of hatred run,
A blood-staind Wretch, not worthy for to view
The rolling Circles, nor the rayie Sun.
I Will never strive to cloak my foul abuses,
So for to make my forfeit to seem less,
And paint my fault with imperfect excuses,
It Is greater far then words can well express.
Nor go I thus to aggrauate my crime,
And damn my self to be absolu'd by others;
No, no, such Rhetoric comes out of time,
I Will not survive his death, as erst my brothers.
Whose unkind fall if I had followd straight,
As then indeed I dyed to all delight,
I had not groaned chargd with this inward weight,
But slept with shadows in eternal night.
Yet must I die at last, though late grown wise,
This in my mind most coffeehouse breeds,
A thousand torturing deaths cannot suffice
To plague condignely for so heinous deeds.
Come, cause him, who the Spritelesse body buries,
Upon the Tomb to sacrifice my blood,
No fitter offering for the infernal Furies
Then one, in whom they reigned while as he stood.
In whom they often infusde their diu'lish rage,
And in my bosom all their Serpents nestled,
So that this hellish horror to assuage,
I all my days have with disasters wrestled.

I find Adrastus, when I deeply scaunce
Th'effectuall motives of this fatal cross,
That not thy malice, but mine own mischaunce
Has been the occasion of our bitter loss.
Whilst barely with a superficial wit,
We weigh the outside of such strange events,
If but the mediate means our judgments hit,
We search not the first cause, this much contents.
When such prodigious accidents fall out,
Though they amaze our minds, and so they must,
The ground of all comes from our self no doubt,
Ah! man has sinned, the heavens are always just.
Now when I search the secrets of my soul,
And rip the corners of my corrupt mind,
Mark of my former life th'offenciue scroule,
And do examine how I was inclinde,
O then I see the angry hosts of heaven
Come girt with flames to plague for my offenses,
Which once no doubt will with the world be even,
And judge our thoughts, words, acts, and vain pretenses.
Son, it is my pride that has procurde thy fall,
I Am guilty of thy blood, I gave the wound
Which was thy death, and whose remembrance shall
My life each day with many deaths confound.
Then iniust Stars, your statutes I contemn;
O! if I were confronted with the gods,
I would their partial providence condemn,
That in such sort do exercise their rods.
Ah! my Sons death does show their judgment naught,
What could he perpetrate against such Powers?
Should he have suffered for his Fathers fault?
Whom without cause their wrong-spent wrath deuours.
Now all the world those deities may despise,
Which plague the guiltless, and the guilty spare:
Cease haples man t'outrage thy self thus ways;
I pardon thee, and pity thy despair.

O cruel judgment of a rigorous fate!
Must I o're-liue my self t'entombe my Fame?
All things that I behold vpbraid my state;
Too many monuments of one man's shame.
All (and no more then I) my deeds detest,
Yet some not find a friend, I find no foe
To rid the world of such a dangerous pest,
Borne but to be an instrument of woe.
I know what makes all worthy minds refrain
The sword against a Catife for to stretch,
They this opprobrious office do disdain,
To be the Deaths-men of so base a wretch.
Or must I yet a fouler fact commit,
And fill the world with th'horrour of my name?
Is there some new disaster resting yet,
And other funerals famous by my shame?
Or would some bastard thought life's cause debate,
That in the blasted field of comfort gleanes,
No, no, in spite of heaven I Will force my fate,
One that is resolved to die, cannot want means.
Proud tyrant Death, and must thou make it strange?
Tinvolue my wearied soul in further strife,
Unless my courage with my fortune change,
I can appoint a Period to my life.
But this (Ay me) all hope of help deuours,
What gains my soul by death in those sad times?
If potent still in all her wonted powers
She must remember of my odious crimes.
What though unbodied she the world forsake?
Yet cannot from her conscience be diuorc'd,
It will but vex her at the shadowie Lake,
Till even to groan the god of ghosts be forced.
But welcome death, and O would God I had
Less famous or more fortunately lived!
Then had I never shown my self so mad
To Have only been by infamy suruiu'd.
Ah! have I lived to see my Lady die,
And die for me, for me not worth so much;
Ah! have I lived (unnatural man) to be
My Brothers death, whose love to me was such.
Ah! have I lived, with mine own hands to kill
A gallant Prince committed to my charge,
And do I gaze on the dead body still,
And in his Fathers sight my shame enlarge.
Ah! have I lived (O execrable Monster)
To be accounted of a diu'lish nature,
And even by them that best my actions conster,
For to be called (and justly called) a Traitor.
Yet with my blood this stain away I Will wash,
And lest my memory make the earth detracted,
Let my name perish in my bodies ash,
And all my life be as a thought vnacted.
Brave Atis, now I come to plead for grace,
Although thou frown'st on my affrighted ghost,
And to revenge thy wrong this wound embrace;
Thus, thus, I toil t'attaine the Stygian coast.

The man himself does desperately wound,
With leaden lights, weak legs, and head declinde,
The body in disdain does beat the ground,
That of his members one has proved unkind:
The fainting hand falls trembling from the sword
With this micidiall blow for shame grown red,
Which strait the blood pursues with vengeance stored
To drown the same with the same floods it shed.
Who of those parties can the combat show,
Where both but one, one both, struck and sustaind,
Or who shall triumph for this strange ore'throw
Whereas the Victor lost, the Vanquished gaind.

Cursde eyes, what sudden change has drowned your lights,
And made your mirthfull objects mournful now?
Ye that were still inurde to stately sights
Since seated under an Imperial brow.
O'reclouded now with vapors of my cares,
Are low thrown down unto a hell of grief,
And have no prospect but my souls despaires,
The sad beholders of a rare mischief.
O dead Adrastus I absolve thy ghost,
Whose hand some secret destiny did charm,
Thou hated by the Heavens, were to thy cost
An accidental Actor of our harm.
No doubt some angry God has laid this snare,
And whilst thy purpose was the Boar to kill,
Did intercept thy shaft amidst the air,
And threw it at my Son against thy will.
Ah Son! must I be witness of thy death,
Who view thee thus with violence to bleed,
And yet want one on whom to power my wrath,
To take just vengeance for so vile a deed?
This wretch whose guiltless mind has cleard his hand
Grieved for his error, lo, vnforcd does fall,
And not as one that did in danger stand,
For he lived still till I forgave him all.
Thus have I but the heavens on whom I may
Power forth the poison of my troubled spirit,
In my souls bitterness I Am forcd to say,
This seconds not their custom and my merit.

WHy spend you (Sir) with sighs The Imperious breath,
Which naught but words of Sovereignty should breed,
O weak revenge for one that is wronged by death,
T'adorne his triumph with a mourning weed!
This pale-faced tyrant, author of our ill,
Who did, t'ecclypse our Joys, that black shaft borrow,
Should you frame Trophies to his Tigrish will,
And wear his livery, and succumbe to sorrow?
No, though he might this outward bliss o're-throw,
And you save you of all that is yours might spoil,
Yet whilst of one that yields no sign you show,
You triumph still, and he receives the foil.
Th'o're-flowing humor that would drown your soul,
In baser breasts might better be excusde,
Who want the sprite their passions to control,
As from their birth still to subjection used.
But you, in whom high Thoughts have been innate,
To this decay how is your Virtue come?
I blush to see my Sovereign so abated,
And Majesty by misery overcome.
Nor are my words out of a rockie mind,
T'unnaturallize you, as not feeling smart,
No, none can bar a Prince from being kind,
Th'undoubted badge of an Heroic heart.
That supreme Power, by which great States do stand,
Should order but the affection, not undo it
And I could wish you might your self command,
Which though you may not well, yet seem to do it.
I will not now rehearse, t'enlarge my grief,
On what just reasons my laments are grounded,
But still will muse upon mine own mischief,
While as my soul a thousand ways is wounded.
What pensive pensill ever limm'd aright
The sad conceats of soule-consuming woe:
Ah! words are weak to show the swelling hight
Of the inward anguish that o're-whelms me so.
Though many Monarchs iealously despise
The rising Sun that their declining stains;
And hate the Heir, who by their fall must rise,
As grieved to hear of death, or others reigns.
My love toward Atis otherwise appeard,
Whom, whilst for him I did my cares engage,
I as a Father loved, as King not feared,
The comfort, not th'encombrance of mine age.
And had thou Son, as reason would, suruiu'd me,
Who glauncd and vanished like a lightning-flash,
Then death of life could never have deprived me,
Whilst such a Phaenix had revived my ash.

Let not these woes ecclypse your Virtues light.


Ah! rage and grief must once be at a hight.


Strive of your sorrows for to stop the source.


These salt eie-floods must flow and have their course.


That is not kingly.


And yet it is kindly.
Where passions do domine they govern blindly.

Such woeful plaints cannot repair your State:


Th'infortunate at least may wail their Fate.
The meanest comfort can to a wretch return,
Is in calamine to have leave to mourn.

What graue-browd Stoic void of all affections,
With teare-lesse eyes could that Youths death behold?
Though green in years, yet ripe in all perfections,
A hoarie judgment under locks of gold.
No, no man lives but must lament to see
The worlds chief hope even in his blossom choked:
But men cannot control the Heavens decree:
And mischief done, can never be revoked.
Then let not this torment your mind no more,
This cross with you alike your Country bears,
If wailing could your ruinde State restore,
Souls fraught with grief should sail in Seas of tears.
Lest all our comfort dash against one shelfe,
And his untimely end occasion yours,
Have pity of your people, spare your self,
If not to your own use, yet unto ours.

When Sandanis, I first thy faith did find,
Thou diu'd so deeply in my bosorn then,
That since thou kept the key still of my mind,
And knew what I conceald from other men.
Behold, I go to open up to you
(Dear Treasurer of all my secrets still)
A mighty enterprise I mind for now:
A Physic in some sort t'asswage my ill.
Which may unto my soul yield some relief,
And make me to forgo sad thoughts content,
Or else acquire copartners in my grief,
If not for me, yet with me to lament.

This benefit must bind me with the rest,
To love your Majesty, and wish you well,
I Will give you my advise, and I protest,
That you take friendly what I freely tell.

Since that it has not pleased the Divine powers,
That of my offspring I might comfort claim,
Yet lest the ravenous course of flying hours
Should make a prey of my respected name,
I hope t'engender such a generous brood,
That the unborn shall know how I have lived,
And this no doubt would do my ghost great good,
To be by famous Victories revived.
I Will Eagle-like so are with Fames immortal wings,
Unless my hie-bent thoughts themselves deceive,
That having acted admirable things,
I may scorn death, and triumph over the grave.
Yet have I not so settled my conceate
That all opinions are to be despisde,
Unfold your judgment touching my estate,
Take heed I Will tell you what I have deuisde.
Some Scithian Shepherd in a high disdain,
As I have heard rehearst by true discourses,
To plague some of the Medes with endless pain,
Did entertain them with Thiestes courses.
And to content their more then Tigrish wishes,
They with the infants flesh the parents fed,
Who not suspecting such polluted dishes,
Did in their bowels bury whom they bred.
Then after this abominable crime,
They come unto my fathers famous court,
And working on the advantage of the time,
Did as they pleased of what was past report.
They showed what served to help, and hid the rest,
Whilst pity pleaded for afflictions part,
He noble-minded favoring the distressed,
Was won to them by this Sinonick art.

Often Kings of Judges thence have parties gone,
Where both their ears were patent but to one.

Then Ciaxare Monarch of the Medes,
To prosecute those fugitives to death,
In indignation of my fathers deeds,
Did boast them both with all the words of wrath.
My father thinking that his court should be
A sanctuary for all supplicants,
Did levy men, that all the world might see
He helped the weak, and scorned the mighties vaunts.
Thus mortal wars on every side proclaimed,
With mutual damage did continue long,
Till both the armies by Bellona tamed,
Did irke t'auenge or to maintain a wrong.
It chanced whilst peace was at the highest dearth,
That all their forces furiously did fight,
A sudden darkness courtain'd up the earth,
And violently dispossessed the light.
I think for Phaeton the Sun looked sad,
And that the bloody objects that he saw
Did wound his memory, with grief gone mad,
He from the world his wagon did withdraw.
Yet Ignorance the mother of confusion,
With wresting natures course found cause of fears,
Which well edged on by wiser men's illusion,
Was cause of concord and of truce from tears.
Then straight there was a perfect peace begun,
And that it might more constantly endure,
Astiages the King of Medias son,
A marriage with my Sister did procure.
A deadly rancour reconciled again,
Must sealed with consanguinitie remain.

He since his fathers age-worne course was ended.
Has ruled his people free from blood or strife,
Till now a Viper of his loins descended,
Would by his ruin make himself a life.
I mean by Cyrus base Cambises brood,
Who by a Bitch nursed with the country swains,
Degener'd far from any princely blood,
The doggish nature of his nurse retains.
He come against his Grandfather to feeld,
And unexpected with a mighty power,
Overthrew his forces, forced himself to yield,
Who captive kept now waits for death each hour.
That you may see now what my interest is,
I made recital of this ruthful story,
Those circumstances show that shame of his
Tends to the derogation of our glory:
That any dare presume to trouble thus
One whom our kingdoms favor should defend,
In strict affinity combind with us,
Yet not respected for so great a friend.
My ioylesse soul with this will be reioyc'd,
Whilst I to war against that rebel go:
I hope that both shall know how they have choyc'd,
The One a kind friend, and the other a fearce fo.

Though Natures law you cared not to transgress,
And this your wronged allye would not repare,
Yet the regard t'a Monarch in distress,
Should move the mighty with a mutual care.
These terrors to that thunder in your ear,
I think the Lidians will not well allow,
For when the Cedar falls, the Oak may fear,
The Assirians ore-throw may astonish you.
And when we see our neighbors house afire,
Then we may judge our own to be in danger,
It Is better first with others to conspire,
Or we be forced our selves t'inuade that stranger.
Ah this is but the outside of your course,
A dangerous ambush by ambition planted,
There may come raging rivers from this source,
To drown your state whilst fancies are undaunted.
I know these newborn monsters of your mind,
Have armed your ravished thoughts with fair conceates,
Yet may these wonders that you have diuin'd,
Prove traitorous proiects painted for deceates.
And (pardon Sir) it is not good to be
Too rashly stout nor curiously wise,
Lest that you from that which is certain flee,
And not attain to that which you devise.

I grant indeed which very few shall know,
Though I design but to relieve my friend,
My thoughts are aimed (this unto you i will show,)
And not without great cause, t'a greater end.
You see how Fortune naught but change affects,
Some are reproached that others may be praisd,
And every age brings forth some strange effects,
Some must be ruined, others must be raisd.
I doubt not you have heard who was the first
Whom fame for warring with the world reuiues,
Who had of sovereignty so great a thirst,
That it could not be quenchd with thousands lives.
It Was he who first obtained the name of Jove,
Who was reputed for his glorious acts,
The most imperious of the powers above,
That vows and offerings of the world exacts.
He all his time could naught but terror breathe,
To make the world acquaint with war and dearth,
The chiefest sergeants deputed by death,
That made the Assirians sovereigns of the earth.
Yet since his course the worlds first plague was past,
His successors who many ages reigned,
Made shipwreck of their Empire at the last,
And by the Medes were thral'd, scorned, and disdained.
This was the cause of that great kingdoms fall,
A King who could not judge of kingly treasures,
With loss of scepter, honor, life and all,
Did buy his base delights and servile pleasures.
To that disastred Monarchies decay,
The Aspiring Persians purpose to succeed,
But I intend to cross them by the way,
And quail their courage ere that they can speed.
The Persians once the Lidians force must prove,
And, O who knows but that it is ordained
At the Tribunal of the States above,
That I should reign where famous Ninus reigned.
This all the host of heaven ofttimes foretells,
To this the gods of Greece my mind have moved,
And he that in the Arabian desert dwells,
By his response this enterprise approved.

Thus still in love with what we mind to do,
What we affect we fairest still conceive,
This feeds our humor whilst we labor, to
Seem full of wit our selves for to deceive.
You flatter so yourselfe, you can not spy
What secret danger this design does bear,
But whilst I look with an indifferent eye
On your intentions, I find cause of fear.
You vnaduisdlie purpose to pursue
A barbarous people that are foes to peace,
Who but by rapine to their greatness grew,
And would for each light cause the wars embrace.
No dainty silks of the Assirian dye,
Do deck their bodies to abase their minds,
But clothed with wild beasts skins they do defye
The force of Phoebus rays, and Eols winds.
They simply feed and are not grieved each day,
With stomachs cloyd decocting diverse meats,
They fare not as they would, but as they may,
Of judgment sound not carried with conceates.
These uncorrupted customs that they hold,
Make all things easy that they feel no pain,
This cooles the Summers heat, kills Winters cold,
This makes the Rivers dry, the Mountains plain.
Those whose ambition poverty did bound,
Of the delights of Lidia if they taste
Will have in hatred straight their barren ground,
And insolentlie all our treasures waste.
To govern such although that you prevail,
You shall but buy vexation with your blood,
And do your self and yours, if fortune fail,
From a possessed Sovereignty seclude.
Yea, though this rash desire your judgment leads,
I for my part must praise the gods for you,
The have not put into the Persians heads,
To war against the Lidians long ere now.

These flames that burn my breast must once burst out,
Your counsel for more quiet minds I leave,
And be you still thought wise, so I prove stout,
I Will conquer more, or lose the thing I have.

YEt am I forced out of afflictions store,
To ease my mind a few sad words to strain,
And but unload it now to lode it more,
I empty but mine eyes to fill again.
My soul must sound even as my passions strike,
Which now are tuned to nothing but mischief,
My breast and eyes are both accursed alike,
The cabinet of care, the cells of grief.
O cruel heaven, fierce star, unhappy fate,
Too foul injustice of the divine powers,
Whose high disdain toward me with partial hate,
The comfort of the world (sad world) deuoures.
Cursed be the day in which I first was borne,
When lying toungs affirmed I come to light,
A monstrous blasphemy, a mighty scorn,
Since it was to darkness and a ioy-set night.
O happy if I then had chanced to smother,
That the first hour had been the last to me,
Then from one grave to have gone unto another,
I should have did to live, not lived to die.
What profited to me my parents joys,
That with such pomp did solemnize my birth,
When I must be the mirror of annoyes,
And all my days taste but one dram of mirth?
Which served for nothing but to make me know,
The height of horror that was to succeed,
I was but raisd up high to be brought low,
That short-liu'd joys might endless anguish breed.
That nothing might for my confusion lack,
All my best actions but betrayed my state,
My virtues too were guilty of my wrack,
And warred against me banded with my fate.
For whilst my Virgin-yeares with praise I past,
Which did (ah that it did) too much import,
My modest eye told that my mind was chaste:
This gained the warrant of the worlds report,
And Maids must have a great respect to fame,
No greater dowry then an unstained name.
Fair beauties Goddess, thou can bear record,
My offering never made thine altar rich,
All such lascivious fancies I abhord,
My freeborn thoughts no folly could bewitch.
Till happily (ah so it seemed to some)
Ah but vnhappelie the event has proved:
All this and more to Atis ears did come,
Who straightway likt, and after liking loved:
Then to our ears his purpose did impart,
Not lip-sick-louer-like with words far sought,
His tongue was but the agent of his heart,
Yet could not tell the tenth part of his thought.
And lest his trauells should have seemed to tend
To breach my honor, work my fames decay,
He brought his wishes to a lawful end,
And by the effect, the affection did bewray.
Their Juno president of wedlockes vow,
And Hymen with his saffron-colour'd cote,
Our love with sacred customs did allow,
Whilst th'ominous Owls no crosses did denote.
The blessing that this marriage did procure,
It was too great to have continued long,
A thing that is vehement can not endure:
Our joys far past th'expressing of the tongue,
Who ever did full satisfaction find,
Yet with satietie were never cloyed,
We seemed two bodies governed by one mind,
Such was the happiness that we enjoyed.
He loved me dearly, I obeyed his will,
Proud of my self because that I was his,
A harmony remaind betwixt us still,
Each in another placed their chiefest bliss.
This moved th'Immortalls to a high disdain,
That thus two worldlings who of death were heirs,
Should in a paradise of joys remain,
Which did exceed, at least did equal theirs.
But chiefly Juno did dispight it most,
Who through a jealousy still iarres with Jove,
That bodie-prison'd souls of that could boast,
Which she (although Heavens Queen) had not above.
Thus even for envy of our rare delights;
The fatal Sisters by the heavens subborn'd,
Of my souls treasure closd the lovely lights,
By which they thought the earth too much adorned.
O but he is not dead, he lives in me,
Ah but I live not, for I did in him,
The one without the other can not be,
If death have set his eyes, mine must look dim.
Since to my sight that Sun no more appeer'd,
From whom my beauties borrowed all their rays,
A long eclipse that never shall be cleared,
Has darkened all the points of my sad days.
Ay me! I live too long, he did too soon,
Thus still the worst remain, the best depart,
Of him who told how this black deed was done.
The words like swords shall ever wound my heart.
Fierce tyrant Death, that in thy wrath did take
One half of me, and left an half behind,
Take this to thee, or give me the other back,
Be altogether cruel, or all kind.
For whilst I live, thou can not wholly dye,
O! even in spite of death, yet still my choice,
Often with th'Imaginations loue-quicke eye,
I think I see thee, and I hear thy voice.
And to content my languishing desire,
Each thing to ease my mind some help affords,
I fancy whiles thy form, and then afire,
In every found I apprehend thy words.
Then with such thoughts my memory to wound,
I call to mind thy looks, thy words, thy grace,
Where thou did haunt, yet I adore the ground,
And where thou stepped, O sacred seems that place!
My solitary walks, my widowd bed,
My driery sighs, my sheets often bathd with tears,
These can record the life that I have led
Since first sad news breathed death into mine ears.
I live but with despair my sprite to dash,
Thee first I loved, with thee all love I leave;
For my chaste flames extinguishd in thy ash
Can kindle now no more but in thy grave.
By night I wish for day; by day for night;
Yet wish far more, that none of both might be;
But most of all, that banishd from the light
I were no more, their courses for to see.
At night revoluing my despaird estate,
I go to sum with sighs my wonted joys,
When in an agony, a grieved conceate
Does blot th'unperfect count with new annoyes.
When Sleep the eldest brother of pale Death,
The Child of darkness, and Father of rest,
In a free prison has confinde my breath,
That it may vent, but not with words expressed.
Then with my sprite thou enterst for to speak
With honyed speeches to appease my grief,
And my sad heart that labourd for to break,
In this fayn'd comfort finds a while relief.
Yea, it our souls remaind united so,
This late diuorcement would not vex my mind,
But when I waken, it augments my woe,
Whilst this a dream, and me a wretch I find.
O happy, if I had been happy never,
But happier, if my happiness had lasted:
Yet had I in this state chanced to persevere,
My days had with excessive joys soon wasted.
Why waste I thus, whilst vainly I lament,
The precious treasure of that swift Post Time?
Ah! pardon me, (dear Love) for I repent
My lingering here, my Fate, and not my crime.
Since first thy body did enrich the Tomb,
In this spoild world, my eye no pleasure sees,
And Atis, Atis, lo, I come, I come
To be thy Mate, amongst the Myrtle trees.

Lo all our time even from our birth,
In naught but misery exceeds,
For where we find a moments mirth,
A Month of mourning still succeeds,
By all the evils that Nature breeds,
Which daily do our sprites appall,
Th'infirmities that frailty sends,
The loss of it, that fortune lends:
And such disasters as often fall:
Yet to far worse our states are thrall,
Whilst wretched man with man contends,
And every one his whole force bends,
How to procure another losses;
But this torments us most of all,
The mind of man, which many a fancy tosses,
Does forge unto it self a thousand crosses.
O how the Soul with all her might
Does all her heavenly forces strain!
How to attain unto the light
Of Natures wonders, that remain
Hid from our eyes, we strive in vain
To seek out things that are unsure:
In Sciences to seem profound,
We diue so deep we find no ground,
And the more knowledge we procure,
The more it does our minds allure,
Of mysteries the depth to sound:
Thus our desires we never bound,
Which by degrees thus drawn on still,
The memory may not endure:
But like the tubs that Danaus daughters fill,
Does drink no faster then it is forced to spill.
Yet how comes this? and O how can
Divine Knowledge the Souls chief treasure
Occasion such a cross to man?
That should afford him greatest pleasure:
O it is because we cannot measure
The limits that to it belong!
But for to tempt forbidden things,
Do soar too high with Natures wings:
Still weakest whilst we think us strong,
The Heavens that think we do them wrong,
To try what in suspense still hings,
This cross upon us justly brings:
With knowledge, knowledge is confusde,
And grows a grief ere it be long.
That which a blessing is, being rightly used,
Does grow the greatest cross, when it is abusde.
Ah! what auailes this unto us,
Who in this veil of woes abide,
With endless toil to study thus,
To learn the thing that Heaven would hide:
And trusting in too blind a guide,
To spy the Planets how they move,
And too transgressing common bars
The constellation of the stars,
And all that is decreed above,
Whereof as often the event does prove,
Th'intelligence our welfare marres,
And in our breasts breeds endless wars,
Whilst what our Horoscopes foretell,
Our expectations do disprove,
Those apprehended plagues prove such a Hell,
That we would wish t'vnknow them till they fell.
This is the pest of great Estates;
They by a thousand means devise
How to foreknow their doubtful Fates,
And like new Giants scale the Skies,
Heavens secret storehouse to surprise:
Which sacriligious skill we see
With what great pain they apprehend it,
And then how foolishly they spend it,
To learn the thing that once must be:
Why should we seek our destiny?
If it be good, we long attend it,
If it be evil, none may amend it;
Such knowledge further rest exiles,
It Is best to abide the Heavens decree,
It Is to be feared, those whom this Art beguiles,
Do change their fate and make their Fortune wheels.
And lo of late, what has our King
By his prepost'rous travels gaind,
In searching each particular thing
That Atis Horoscope containd;
But what the Heavens had once ordaind,
He could not by no means prevent,
And yet he labors to find out
Through all the Oracles about,
Of future things th'vnsure event,
This does his rauing mind torment,
Now in his age unwisely stout
To fight with Cyrus, but no doubt
The Heavens are grieved for to hear told
Long ere the time their hid intent.
Let Tantalus b'a terror to th'o're-bold
That dare Jove's cloudy secrecies unfold.
Go, Let us triumph over these vnthron'd thralls,
Whose maimed greatness to confusion runs,
Who forfeited their glory by their falls;
No hand that fights is pure, but that which winnes.
The ravished world that fraught with doubts did stand,
To see the bloody end of this days toil,
Saw how the Heavens placd lightning in my hand,
To thunder on all those that sought my foil.
Now therefore let us first devoutly go
And lose our vows, the gods detest th'ingrate,
And who delight to adore their deities so,
Do never fail t'establish their estate.
Go load the Altars, smoke the sacred places
With Bullocks, Incense, Odours of all kinds,
Though none can give the gods that flow in graces
A sweeter Sacrifice then thankful minds.
Though all that indenized in this Vale
Walk here confinde within this fertile Round,
And are tapestred with this azure Pale,
To Adore the gods by many means are bound.
Yet there are some particularly, I find,
Whose names are written in their dearest scrowles,
Whom extraordinary favors bind,
Even to prefer them to their very Souls.
Of which (Sir) you are one, your deeds declare,
Of you amidst innumerable broils,
Even from your cradle they have had a care,
And led you safe through all your greatest toils.
Though of the dangers of your youth I see
The thought no more with grief your mind importunes;
Yet I think on who had the hap to be
An Actor in your Tragick-Comick fortunes.

The accidents that in our Nonage chance,
When as our years grow ripe, slide out of thought
Like fabulous dreams that Darkness does advance,
And are by Day disdaind as things of naught.
For our Conceptions are not then so strong*
As for to leave the impression long behind,
Yet mix (dear Friend) old griefs new Joys among,
And call afflicted Infancy to mind.

Who would not wonder at thy wondrous Fate,
Whose ruin ere thy Birth appeard conspired?
Who vnbegun, seemd to expire that date,
Which now begun, shall never be expired.
Your Mother first her Sire with cares did sting,
While as he dreamd, which yet his soul confounds,
That from her womb there did a Vine-tree spring,
Which did o're-shadow all great Asiaes bounds.
Then to the Magies strait he gave in charge,
To try what this strange Vision did presage,
Who having studied their dark Art at large,
Gave this response with a prophetic rage.
That once his Daughter should bring forth a Son,
For glorious Acts exceedingly renownd,
By whom The Empire of Asia should be won;
By whom his Grandfather should be vncrownd.
This to Astiages a terror bredde,
Who laboring to anull the heavens decree,
Aduisde as best his Daughter for to wedde
T'a powrelesse stranger, but of base degree.
Then of Cambises he by chance made choice,
And for his barbarous Countries cause the rather,
Whom by your birth the Princess did rejoice,
And further then before affright her Father.
Thus tyranny by feeble sprites begun,
Does force the Parents in despair to fall,
A dastard to attempt, proud having won,
Which being feared of all, does still fear all.
And tyrants no security can find,
For every shadow frights a guilty mind.
This Monarch, whom scarce Armies could surprise,
Whom gallant Guards and stately Courts delighted,
Who triumphd over The Earth, threatened the Skies,
A Babe scarce borne, come of himself, affrighted.
And whilst Lucina the last help did make,
As if some ugly Monster had been borne,
A Minotoure, a Centaure or a Snake,
The worlds terror, and the Mothers scorn.
The Nephews birth, that would have seemd t'impart
Unto the Grandfather great cause of joys,
As if the naked hand had pierced his heart,
Did wind him in a maze of sad annoyes.
And to prevent a but suspected spite,
By giving an occasion of just hate,
He sought by robbing you the newfound Light,
To make your birth and burial of one date.
Soon after this he sent for me in have,
Whom at that time (and not in vain) he loved,
Then showed me all the circumstances past,
Wherewith his marble mind seemd nothing moved:
Out of the which, as he would let me know,
All complements of pity were not blotted,
He would this superficial favor show,
Not with your blood to have his own hands spotted.
Thus having lulld asleep the conscience, still
The wicked would extenuate their crimes,
Not knowing those that but allow of ill,
Are Actors in effect, guilty all times.
Yet with his fault he would have burdend me,
And willd that I an Innocent should slay,
I promisde to perform his rash decree,
Well weighing whom, but not wherein t'obay.
When I had parted from his Highness face,
And carried you (then swadled) with me too,
Through th'apprehended horror of my case,
I stood perplexed and wist not what to do.
Necessity took place, I waild with tears
Th'vntimely funerals (as I thought) or you*
My soul confounded with a swarm of fears*
Did with sad sighs my message disallow.
Yet t'him I send a servant of mine own,
Who for the time was Heards-man to the King,
To whom I made all my commission known,
But as direct to him showed every thing.
Delivering you with an unwilling breath,
Then with a mantle of pure gold arrayed,
I threatened him with many a cruel death,
If that your death were any way delayed.
Straight for to execute th'intended doom,
He from my sight did all astonished go:
Too great a charge for such a simple groom,
The show of Majesty amazed him so.
O what a wonder is it for to behold,
Th'vnfailing providence of powrefull Jove,
Whose brazen edicts can not be controld,
Firm are the statutes of the states above.
That mortal whom th'Immortalls favor shields,
No worldly force is able to confound,
He may securely walk through dangers fields,
Times and occasions are to attend him bound.
For lo before the Herds-man was come home,
His wife of a dead burden was delivered,
Who wondered so to see her Husband come,
That with a secret terror faintlie shiuered.
She straight grew curious for to know the form
How he a Babe so beawtifull obtaind,
Who did her suddenly of all inform,
And to what cruelty he was constraind.
See quickly then the occasion to embrace,
No doubt inspired by some celestial power,
Prayed him t'expose her dead child in your place,
Yet where no beasts repaired him to devour:
So shall we have (says she) a double gain,
Our offspring shall receive a stately tomb,
And we a princely infant, to remain
Still nursed with us as the issue of my womb.
The Husband likte so well his Wives intent,
That all what she affected he effected,
And soon I had one of my household sent,
To try if all were done as it was directed:
He seeing the babe dead, dead in that weed,
With that rich funeral furniture about him,
Told what the fellow told, and I indeed
Reposd on his report, for who could doubt him?
In end, Time posting with houre-feth'red wings,
Had given you strength with others of your years,
You past the time, not nephews unto Kings,
But for that time admitted for your peers.
They fail, call Fortune blind, she sight bewrayd,
And your authority by lot enlarged,
In pasturall sports who still the scepter swayd,
And as but borne for that, that best discharged.
Then with the other children as it chanced,
A noble man of Medeas son remaind,
Who swollen with envy to see you advanced,
Your childish charge with scornful words disdaind.
You spighting at that proud attempt of his,
Did punish him as it became a Prince:
I doubt now (Sir) if that you think on this,
The rest of rashness did your deed convince.

More mighty matters now to muse upon,
My memory with the remembrance cloy,
That those are all forgot, and yet tell on,
For I delight to hear this childish toy.

The father of the child informed the King
How such a base-borne boy abusd his son,
And causd an Esquire straightway you to bring,
To suffer for the fault that you had done.
And when the King accusd you in his sight,
As the presumptuous brat of a base clown,
You boldly did maintain that you had right
To scourge one that rebeld against your crown.
The King astonished at the imperious words
Of one so magnanimous, and so young,
Does pawse awhile, and straightway he records,
That you were you, and I had done him wrong.
The tortour to the Net-heard was presented,
Who soon for fear confessed (O sudden change)
The King as seemed exceedingly contented,
Sent one for me to hear the tidings strange.
And as he had good cause, in show delighted,
Did for a solemn Sacrifice prepare,
And me as his most special guest invited,
Who with my son did straight to Court repair.
When light was banished by nights shaddowie sable,
The candles by his forfait taking place,
They served me with my sons flesh at the table,
Then did vpbraid me with his bloodlesse face.
What anguish, or what rage ore-flow'd my soul,
A loving father may imagine best,
Yet at that time I did my rage control,
But laid it up for ever in my breast.

Some of the wise men then I heard remained,
Who from their former sentence did recoyle,
Saying, no danger was since I had raignd,
And so dismissed me for my native soil:
Where when I had my unripe season spent,
Your Letter came to give my fire new fuel,
And told how many of the Medes were bent,
T'abandon their own Lord that proved so cruel:
And wished if to that Scepter I aspired,
That I should move the Persians to rebel,
Which did succeed even as my soul desired,
For they disdained in servitude to dwell.
I placed my gallant troops in warlike ordour,
And lest the occasion should have slipped away,
Marched with my army to my enemies bordour,
Whereas you had the conduct for that day.

Lo how those wretches that the heavens would wrack
Are spoild of judgment: that proud Tirant offered
The charge to me not thinking I would take
A high revenge for th'iniurie I suffered,
Which was so deeply rooted in my heart,
My countries thraldom, and mine own disgrace,
And all the horrors that death could impart,
Seemed naught to me so my disdain took place.

It Is dangerous trusting one that is wronged we see,
Just rancour unrevenged can never die.

That was the first beginning of your glory,
Which since has been augmented by degrees,
And which by time may breed so brave a story,
As may be precious in all Princes eyes.

Behold how Croesus with his riches blinded,
Durst come t'encounter with my warlike bands,
And through a long prosperity high-minded,
Was not affrayd to fall before my hands.
But he and his confederates have seen,
How Victory does still my troops attend,
And Persia must be once all Asiaes Queen,
Orwe shall (...) to the worlds end.
Now Croesus is ore-come rich Sardis taken,
And Lidia fraught with gold is made our spoil,
The Egiptians have th'vnprosp'rous league forsaken,
This is the happy end of all our toil.
But ah one sour vnseasons all my sweetes,
Brave Abradatus my brother in arms,
Whose praise through all the peopled circuit fleetes,
And with his love each generous courage warmes.
Whilst but ouer-bold for to be backed so badlie,
The Egiptian Chariots desperately he charged:
There with euill-fortun'd valor fighting madlie,
His soul out of the earths prison was enlarged.

No doubt that dame this trouble hardly bears,
Who only seemed for him t'account of life:
I heard him whilst she bathed his Coach with tears,
Wish to prove worthy of so rare a wife.
When their farewell was sealed, last speeches spent,
She kissed the Coach that did contain her trust,
And with eyes big with pearl gazed where he went,
Still till her sight was choked with clouds of dust.

I hear you have not heard how his death proved
The black beginning of a bloody scene,
His wife Panthea at the first not moved,
Seemed as she had some marble image been.
The body that had often her fancies fired
She causd bear out of sight, still dear, though dead,
But being to Pactolus banks retired,
She in her bosom did entombe his head.
And then from rage she did some respit borrow,
For sorrow by degrees a passage seeks,
Vapouring forth sighs that made a cloud of sorrow,
A tempest then of tears rained down her cheeks.
And whilst her eye the wonted object misses,
She many a languishing look does cast,
And on the senseless lips still lauish'd kiss,
As affectionedlie as in times past.
I poasted thither for to have releeu'd
This Lady of a portion of her woes,
Heaven bear me witness I was greatly grieved,
Who would, to save one friend, spare hosts of foes.
She first a space me passionatlie eyde,
Then with these words her lips did slowly move,
My husband lo has valorously did,
Well worthy of your friendship, and my love.
When I had all the flowers of comfort used.
That a sad soul o'recharg'd with grief could show,
I went away with words that were confusde,
And scarcely could my last farewell forth throw.
I was not well departed from her face,
When as she char'gd the Eunuchs out of sight,
Then prayed her nurse to bury in one place
Her and her Lord, as they deserved of right.
Then looking on his corpse she drew a sword,
And even as if her soul had flowne in him,
She stabd her self, then falling on her Lord,
Her beauties blubbered stars were waxing dim.
The faithful Eunuchs for their Sovereign sorry,
And scorning to survive so rare a date,
In emulation of their mistress glory,
Did violently partners of her fate.
O sweet Panthea rich in rarest parts!
I must admire thy ghost though thou be gone,
Who might have made a monarchy of hearts,
Yet loathed unlawful loves, and loved but one.
O wondrous wonders, wonders wondrous rare!
A woman constant, such a beauty chaste,
So pure a mind joined with a face so fair,
Beauty and Virtue in one person placde!
Both were well matched as any could devise,
Whose undivided end their choice alowes,
He valorous, she virtuous, both wise,
She worthy such a mate, he such a spouse.
And Harpagus, lest that it should be thought,
The memory of virtuous minds may dye,
Cause build a stately tomb with statues wrought,
Where their dead bodies may respected lie.

I Will raise a Piramide of Croesus spoils,
Where all their famous parts shall be comprisde,
But how t'insist in these tumultuous broils,
It Is best now (Sir) that you were well aduisde.
Your adversary does attend your will,
This hautie city humbled has her crest,
And therefore go to pardon, or to kill,
To save, or sack, even as you shall think best.

Abstract for old Croesus I am else resolved,
He with some captives which I keep in store,
Shall have their bodies by the fire dissolved,
As offrands to the Gods that I adore.
This city shall my soldiers pains defray,
Since by their force it has been brought to bow,
I yield it unto them as their just pray,
Who taste the sweetness of their travels now.
Of other things we shall so well dispose,
That our renown over all the world shall shine,
Till Cyrus name b'a terror to all those,
I That dare against his Sou'raigntie repine.

AH to what part shall I my steps address,
The burden of base bondage to eschew?
Lo, desolation, ruin, and distress,
With horror does my native home pursue.
And now poor country take my last farewell,
Farewell all joy, all comfort, all delight:
What heavy tidings have thou for to tell,
That tear'st thy garments thus, tell thy sad plight?

I tell the wrack of us, and all that live
Within the circuit of this wretched soil.

A hideous shout we heard the City give,
Is It in the enemies hands, is it made his spoil?

It Is made his spoil.


And is our Sovereign killed?


No, but yet nearly escaped does live in danger.


Then let our ears be with disasters filled,
And must we bear the yoke of that proud stranger?

You know how Croesus at the advantage lay,
Still seeking means t'abate the Persians pride,
And his confederates had assigned a day
When they should for th'intended war provide.
But Cyrus having heard how that they should
Against his state so great an army bring,
Straight raising all the forces that he could,
Preuents, inuades, o'recomes and takes our King.

This shows a Captain both expert and brave,
First well t'aduise, then t'execute with speed:
No circumstance (friend) vnrelated leave,
Which with our Kings did our confusion breed.

When Croesus saw that Cyrus came so soon,
He stood awhile with a distracted mind,
Yet what time would permit, left naught undone,
But made his Musters, marched his Foe to find.
Our stately Troops that glisterd all with gold,
And with vmbragious Feathers fanned the air,
They with unwary insolence grown bold,
More how to triumph, then to overcome, took care.
The Lidian Horsemen are of great account,
And are for valor through the world renownd,
Them Cyrus chiefly labourd to surmount,
And this devise for that effect was found.
Vntrussing all their baggage by the way,
Of the disburthen'd Camels each did bear
A grim-fac'd Groom, who did himself array
Even as the Persian Horsemen use to wear.
To them th'Infanterie did follow next,
A solid Squadron like a brazen wall,
But those in whom all confidence was fixed,
The brave Cauallerie came last of all.
Then Cyrus by the raynes his Courser took,
And being mounted, holding out his hands,
With an assured and Imperious look
Went breathing valor through th'vnconquer'd bands.
He willd all them that at Deaths game should strive,
To spare none of their foes in any form,
But as for Croesus, to take him alive,
And keep him captive for a greater storm.
Where famous Hellus does to Hermus post
In his broad waves t'entombe his strength and name,
Our Army ran against a greater Host
To Enrich it likewise with our force and fame.
Our Troops a time with equal valor stood,
Till giving place, at length we took the chase,
While as the River ran to hide our blood,
But still his borders blushed at our disgrace.
For so soon as the Camels once were come,
Our Horses loathing to endure their sight,
Ran raging back again, and of them some
Disordring rancks, put many to the flight.
Yet others that were of more martial minds,
Perceived the Stratagem that did deride them,
And lighting on their feet, like mighty winds,
Bare down before them all that durst abide them.
There, whilst: the world proou'd prodigal of breath,
The headless troncks lay prostrated in heaps,
This field of funerals, proper unto death,
Did paint out Horror in most hideous shapes.
There men vnhorsde, horses vnmastred, strayed,
Some called on them whom they most dearly tendered,
Some ragde, some groand, some sighed, roard, wept and prayed,
Fighting, fainting, falling, desperate, maymde, rendered.
Those that escapt, like beasts unto a Den,
Fled to a Fortress, which true valor drownes,
Walls are for women, and the fields for men,
For Towns cannot keep men, but men keep Towns.
And we were scarcely entered at the Ports,
When as the enemies did the Town enclose,
And rearing many artificial Fortes,
To the Defenders did huge pains impose.
There all the military slights werere found,
Which at the like encounters had preuaild,
Both for to use the advantage of the ground,
Or for to help with Art where Nature faild.
They ever compassing our Trench about,
Still where the Walls were weakest, made a breach,
Which being straight repaird, we threw tools out,
And killd all those that came within our reach.
There all the bolts of death edgde by disdain,
That many curious wits inclinde to ill,
Helped by the occasion, and the hope of gain,
Had power t'inuent, were put in practice still.
Yet as we see, it often times has occurrde,
Where we suspected least, we were surprisde,
Whilst fortune and the fates in one concurrde
To have our ruin in their rolls comprisde.
The side of Sardis that was least regarded,
Which lies toward Tmolus, and was thought most sure,
Through this presumption, whilst it was weakly guarded,
Th'orethrow of all Lidia did procure.
As one of ours (unhappily it chanced)
T'o're-take his helmet that had escaped his hand,
Along that steepy part his steps advanced
And was returning back unto his Band:
He was well marked by one that had not spard
No kind of danger for to make us thralles,
For Cyrus had proposde a great reward
To any one that first could scale our walls.
And this companion seeing without stay,
One in his sight that craggie passage clim,
Straight followd on his footsteps all the way,
And many a thousand followd after him.
By whom all those that durst resist were killd,
The rest were forced, and knew not where to flee:
For every street was with confusion filld,
There was no corner from some mischief free.
O what a piteous clamor did arise,
Of ravished virgins, and of widowd wives!
Who pierced the heavens with lamentable cries,
And having lost all comfort, loathd their lives.
Whilst those proud Victors did insist to have staind
Themselves with all the wrongs that such like use,
They by a charge from Cyrus were restraind,
And durst no more their captives thus abuse.

No doubt but desolation then abounded,
Whilst with disdain the Conqu'rors bosom boylde,
Some with the sword, some with disgrace confounded,
Sacred Temples, private houses, all were spoylde.
None can imagine greater misery
Then all the sufferings of a captived City.
But whilst this famous City was distressed,
What could become of the hard-fortun'd King?

He seeing the enemy of his State possessed,
And that confusion seazde on every thing,
Stood first amazd, scarce trusting his own sight,
His former fortune had him so transported,
Yet it is hard for to deny the light,
He saw a stranger that his wealth extorted.
And when that he had deeply apprehended
Th'vnbounded horrors that o'reflow'd his soul,
As one whose Joys had long before been ended,
He could no more the signs of grief control.
But bursting out in bitter sighs and tears,
Plungde in the deepest depth of black despair,
Through over great fear, leaving all kind of fears,
Did of his safety take no further care,
And never wished he so for a long life,
But he o're-wisht it, wishing for death now,
Still seeking danger in the bounds of strife,
Providing that he did, he cared not how.
Whilst thus he fostred furies in his breast,
A certain soldier by the way him meets,
As insolent as any of the rest,
That drunk with blood, ran raging through the streets:
And seeking but an object to his ire,
He made to him, and he to him again,
I wot not which of them did most desire,
The One for to slay, or the other to be slain.
But whilst so base a hand towering aloft,
Did to so great a Monarch threaten death,
His eldest Son, that as you have heard often,
Was barrd from the right function of his breath.
I cannot tell you well, nor in what fashion,
If that the destinies had so ordaind,
Or if the vehemence of his passion
Did break the strings that had his tongue restraind.
But when he saw his Sire in such a danger,
He bursted forth into those words the rather,
Hold, hold thy hand in haste thou furious stranger,
Kill not King Croesus, murder not my Father.
The other hearing this, his hand retyrde,
Then called his Kings commandment to mind,
And to no small preferment he aspyrde,
To whom this desert did his Sovereign bind.
Now, when that Croesus, who for death did languish,
Was of this fair occasion disappointed,
O're-chargd with grief, and surfeiting of anguish,
To see himself for further evils appointed.
He with sad sighs those syllables did accord,
Now cruel destiny do what thou can,
Which would not unto me the grace afford
That I might perish like a private man.
Ah! must I live to wish to have been unborn,
Charactring shame in a dejected face?
Ah! must I live to my perpetual scorn,
The finger-pointed object of disgrace?
Yet this unto his soul more sorrow bred,
He King-like as in former times arrayde,
Was with a mighty acclamation led
Strait to the Tent whereas their Emperor stayde.
So soon as Cyrus got him in his power,
He causde bring bands of iron, burd'nous chains,
And clogd him hand and foot at that same hour,
As one that was designed for grievous pains.
Then causde in haste a pile of wood to make,
And in the midst where all men might espy him,
Causde bind the captived King unto a stake,
With fourteen others of the Lydians by him.
There, as th'oblation for his Victory,
With sacred flames their bodies to combure,
Although Jove hates prepostrous piety,
And does delight in offerings that are pure.
Now whilst the fires were kindling round about,
As one that to some powrefull god had vowed,
With eyes bent up, and with his hands stretched out,
O Solon, Solon, Croesus cride alowd.
Some hearing him to utter such a voice,
And seeing Cyrus curious for to know,
Now of what Deity dying he made choice,
Did pray him liberally his mind to show.
He answered; upon one in wit profound
He called, with whom he wished, if it might be,
That all the Rulers of th'inferior round
Had had some conference as well as he.
For he had told him whilst his fortune lasted,
As one expert in good aduises giving,
That all his flowers of bliss might soon be blasted,
And could not be accomplished he being living.
Then he proceeded for to show at length
The Dialogue twixt Solon and twixt him,
Who prayed him not to trust in worldly strength,
By which unto true bliss no man could clim.
This speech moved Cyrus deeply, for to ponder
The great uncertainty of worldly things,
As thinking that himself might be brought under,
Who had no privilege more then other Kings.
Then having such a pattern placed before him,
Whose farre-changd fortune thoroughly was revolu'd,
He freely did his liberty restore him,
And willd him from the fire to be absolu'd.
O now Devotion! well appeard thy force,
Which binds the earth and opens up the Heaven,
In the celestial breasts a deep remorse
Was strangely wrought whilst Coesus prayed; for even
Whileas the flashing flames, in vain to quench,
All men did labor, but could do no good,
The clouds were opend and a shower did drench
The fiery ashes of the flaming wood.
Now whilst that Croesus coming from the fire,
Saw ruthles sould'ers sacking all the City,
To save the same he had a great desire,
And spoke to Cyrus melting all in pity.
Great Prince, for famous Victories renownd,
Who do in arms all others so surmount,
That it contents me much to be vncrownd
By one so worthy, and in such account:
And since I am constraind your thrall to be,
I must conform my self unto my fate,
And cannot hold my pace whereas I see
Ought to preiudge the greatness of your State,
Which ah! is wounded now with your own powers,
Whilst this rich City is sacked and o'rethrowne,
It is not mine no more, no, it is yours,
And therefore (Sir) have pity of your own.
Yea, though the loss of such a populous Town,
That Is rich, that is yours, your mind could nothing move,
Yet think of this that does import your Crown;
A piece of policy which time will prove.
The barbarous Persians borne with stubborn minds,
Who but for poverty first followd you,
Their matchless worth in arms all Asia finds,
Their fear is fallen upon all Nations now.
But if you suffer them in such a sort
To Enrich themselves with plenteous Lidiaes spoil,
Not able then their Conquest to support,
The Victor of the vanquished gets the foil.
For this will make them wealthy out of measure:
Wealth to confusion many a Country leads;
Whilst feebled with delights, in-vilde with pleasure,
No thought of honor harbors in their heads.
Then Cyrus strait approving what he spoke,
His soldiers from their pillage were restraind,
Pretending first the tenth part for to take,
As a rich offering for the Gods ordaind.
Of our distress, this is the ruthful story;
A stranger is possessed of this Province;
Our King has with the loss of all his glory
Bought breath a while, a poor thing for a Prince.

O woeful people! O unhappy King!
Our joys are spoyld, his happiness expyrde,
And no new chance can any comfort bring
To either now, whose fall the Fates conspyrde.
Go woeful messenger, hold on thy course,
For to have heard too much, it yrks our ears,
We ever must bewail thy sad discourse,
Accented with sighs, and poynted with tears.

WHat needs me more of my mishap to pause?
Though I have tasted of afflictions cup,
Yet it may be, the gods for a good cause
Have cast me down to raise a thousand up.
And never let a Monarch after me,
Trust in betraying titles glorious bates,
Who with such borrowed feathers rashly flee,
Fall melted with the wrath of greater states.
O had this precious wit enriched my mind,
Which by experience I have dearly bought,
Whilst fortune was within my court confind,
And that I could not think a bitter thought.
Then satisfide with Soueraignties erst proved,
I had disdained new dangers to embrace,
And clothed with majesty, admired and loved,
Had lived with pleasure, and had did in peace.
Yet it is wonderful in any state,
To see a worldling prosper, and not proud;
But chiefly we whose fortunes grow so great,
It Is hard for us to have our high thoughts bowd.
What could the world afford, or man affect,
Which did not glad my soul whilst I was such?
Who now am past the compass of respect,
Plagued with prosperity, clogged with too much.
Long luld asleep with scornful fortunes lies,
A slave to pleasure, drowned in base delights,
I made a covenant with my wandering eyes,
To Have entertained them still with pleasant sights.
I held not from my heart none of her wishes,
But wallowing in vainglory this worlds toy,
Still served with dainty, but suspicious dishes,
My soul was sick with pleasure, faint for joy.
There wanted nothing that might help to ease me,
All did divine my will, aim at my though,
And strive to do that which they trow'd would please me,
Which if I but allowd, no more was sought.
What ever come of me was held of weight,
My words were balanced and my looks were marked,
Those whom I graced were had in honor straight,
All speeches in my praises were embarked.
I in magnificence excelled all Kings,
Whilst drowsy in security I slumbred,
My coffers still were full of precious things,
My treasure infinite could not be numbered.
I reard rare buildings all embost with gold,
Made ponds for fishes, forests for wild beasts,
And with transported fancies uncontrolled,
Often spent the day in sport, the night in feasts.
I seemed t'vsurp the power that erst was Jove's,
And of the Elements the course would change,
For stately fountains, artificial groves,
These were so common, they were not thought strange.
With me (what more could any Monarch crave)
In all the parts of pomp none could compare,
My minions gallant, my counselors grave,
My guards were strong, my concubines were fair:
Yea ere my state was cast upon this shelfe,
I wanted naught that could with seeming merits
Breed wonder in the world, pride in ones self,
For to puff up the flesh and spoil the spirits.
Thus pressing with delight the grapes of pleasure,
I quafft with Fortune still sense-pleasing vines,
Till drunk with wealth, and riotous out of measure,
I card not to consume all Tmolus mines.
Then weary to be well, and tired of rest,
T'engender discord I the occasion sought,
Yet for to cloak the ambition of my breast,
Did with devotion long disguise my thought.
I send of all the Oracles to inquire,
What was to come of this intended war,
Who said as seemed to second my desire,
That I a mighty Monarchy should mar.
Those doubtful words I wresting to my will,
In hope t'expugne th'impertous Persians powers,
Did ruin quite whilst all succeeded ill,
What many a age had conquered in few hours.
And this most wondrous is, because most strange,
I who disdained an equal of before,
(What cannot Fortune do, being bent to change)
Must a Superior now serve, and adore?
What eye not fraught with scorn my state surueyes?
Whom Fates have forced for to o're-liue my shame,
And in mine enemies danger for some days,
But borrowd with the intrest of my fame.
Though this sweet gale of life-bestowing winds,
Would seem a favor (so it seems to some,
Who by the baseness of their muddie minds,
Show of the ignoble multitude they come)
I scorn unlike my self for to be seen,
Though to my comfort this appeard to tend,
As if that all misfortunes past had been,
A Tragic entry to a Comicke end.
Of all that plague my state the greatest pest
It is base life, that faints from the earth to sever,
And has in one united all the rest,
To make me die each day, and yet die never.
Life in my breast no comfort can infuse,
An enemies gift could never come for good,
It but gives time of misery to muse,
And bathe my sorrows in a bitter flood.
Ah! had my breath euanish'd with my bliss,
And closde the windows that give light to life,
I had not apprehended as it is
The height of my mishaps that now are rife:
Whilst with a thousand sighs I call to mind,
The death of Atis and mine own decay,
My sprite in such perplexity I find,
That to lives passage I would feign make way.
But since I see reserved for further spite,
I with sad thoughts must burden yet my soul,
My memory t'a melancholious spright,
Of all my troubles shall present a scroule.
Of which while as the account I go to cast,
Th'enormities still numbering of my fate,
I Will whiles look back upon my pleasures part,
And by them balance my (now) hapless state.

Is It not a wonder for to see
How by experience each man reeds,
In practiced volumes penned by deeds,
The Inconstant courses that there be,
Yet whilst our selves continue free,
We ponder often, but not apply,
That precious oil, which we might buy
Best with the price of others pains;
Which as what naught to us pertaines,
To use we will not condescend,
As if we might the Fates defye,
While as untouched our state remains:
But soon the heavens a change may send,
No perfect bliss before the end.
When first we fill with fruitful seed,
The apt-conceauing womb of the earth,
And seem t'expell all fear of dearth,
With the increase that it may breed,
Yet dangers do our hopes exceed,
The frosts may first with cold confound
The tender greens that dect the ground,
Whose wrath though the Aprils smiles assuage,
It has to abide th'Eolian rage,
Which t'o'repasse whilst we attend,
To Have Ceres wandering tresses bound,
The raines let from their cloudie cage,
May spoil what we expect to spend,
No perfect bliss before the end.
Lo whilst the Vine-tree great with grapes
With nectard liquor strives to kiss
Th'imbracing Elm not loved amiss:
Those clusters loose their comely shapes,
Whilst by the thunder burnd in heaps,
All Bacchus hopes fall down and perish:
Thus many a thing does fairly flourish,
That no perfection can attain,
And yet we worldlings are so vain,
That our conceats we highly bend,
If fortune but our springtime cherrish,
Though we have storms for to sustain,
Ere to the harvest our years ascend,
No perfect bliss before the end.
By all that in this world have place,
There is a course that must be run,
And let none judge himself to have won,
Till he have finished first his race,
The forests through the which we trace,
Breed ravenous beasts that do abhor us,
And lie in wait for to devour us,
Whilst brambles do our steps beguile,
The fear of which though we exile,
And to our mark with gladness tend,
Then balls of gold are laid before us,
To entertain our thoughts a while,
And our good meaning to suspend,
No perfect bliss before the end.
Behold how Croesus long has lived,
Throughout this spacious world admired,
And having all that he desired
A thousand means of joy contrived,
Yet now is suddenly deprived
Of all that wealth, and strangely falls;
For every thing his sprite appalles;
His Sons decease, his Countries loss;
And his own State which huge storms toss:
Thus he, who could not apprehend,
Whilst as he slept in marble walls,
No, nor imagine any cross,
To bear all those, his breast must lend:
No perfect bliss before the end.
And we the Lydians that designed
To reign over all that were about us,
Behold how Fortune too does flowt us,
And has us utterly resigned:
For we that had to our selves assigned
A Monarchy, but knew not how,
Yet thought to make the world to bow,
That at our forces stood afraid;
We, we, by whom these plots were laid,
To think of bondage must descend,
And bear the yoke of others now;
O it is truth, that Solon said,
While as he yet does breath extend;
No man is blessed, behold the end.
W. A.
