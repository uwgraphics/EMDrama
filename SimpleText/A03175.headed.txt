DEus hic / the holy trynyte
Preserve all / that now here be
Dear brethren / if ye will consider
The cause why / I am come hyder
Ye would be glad / to know my intent
For I com not hither / for monye nor for rent
I com not hither / for meat nor for meal
But I com hither / for your souls heal
I com not hither / to poll nor to shave
I com not hither to beg nor to crave
I com not hither / to gloss nor to flatter
I com not hither to babble nor to clatter
I com not hither / to fable nor to lie
But I come hither / your souls to edyfye
For we freres / are bound the people to teache
The gospel of Christ / openly to preche
As did the appos^els / by Christ their master sent
To turn the people / and make them to repent
But sith the appostels / fro heaven would not come
We freres now / must occupy their rome
We freres are bound / to search men's conscyens
We may not care for grotes / nor for pens
We freres have professed / wylfull pouerte
No penny in our purse / have may we
Knyfe nor staff / may we none carry
Except we should / from the gospel vary
For worldly aduersyte / may we be in no sorrow
We may not care to day / for our meat to morrow
Bare foot and bare legged / must we go also
We may not care / for frost nor snow
We may have / no manner care ne think
Another for our meat / nor for our drink
But let our thoughts / fro luche things be as free
As be the birds / that in the air flee
For why our lord / clyped sweet Jesus
In the gospel / speaks to us thus
Through all the world / go ye says he
And to every creature / speak ye of me
And show of my doctrine / and conning
And that they may / be glad of your coming
If that you enter / in any house any where
Look that ye salute them / and bid my peace be there
And if that house / be worthy and elect
Thylke peace there / than shall take effect
And if that house / be cursyd or paruert
Thylke peace than shall to your self reuert
And furthermore / if any such there be
Which do deny / for to receive ye
And do despise / your doctrine and your lore
At such a house / tarry ye no more
And from your shoes / scrape away the dust
To their reprefe / and I both true and just
Shall vengeance take / of their sinful deed
Wherefore my friends / to this text take ye head
Beware how ye / despise the pore freres
Which are in this world / crystes mynysters
But do them with an hearty chere receive
Lest they happen / your houses for to leave
And than god will take vengeance in his ire
Wherefore I now / that am a pore friar
Did enquere / were any people were
Which were dysposyd / the word of god to here
And as I came hither / one did me tell
That in this town / right good folk did dwell
Which to here the word of god would be glad
And as soon as I / thereof knolege had
I hyder hyed me as fast as I might
Entendyd by the grace of god almyght
And by your pacyens / and supportacyon
Here to make / a simple colacyon
Wherefore I require all ye in this prese
For to abide / and give dew audyence
But first of all
Now here I shall
To god my prayer make
To give ye grace
All in this place
His doctrine for to take.
And than kneleth down the friar saying his prayers / and in the mean while
enters the pardoner with all ^is rely^ues / to declare what each of them ben /
and the hole power and virtue thereof


God and saint Leonarde send ye all his grace
As many as ben assembled in this place
(...) devout people / that here do assemble
I pray good / that ye may all well resemble
The image / after which you are wrought
And that ye save / that Christ in you bought
Devout Christen people / ye shall all wit
That I am comen hither / ye to vysytte
Wherefore let us pray / thus or I begin
Our sauyoure preserve ye / all from sin
And enable ye to receive / this blessed pardon
Which is the greatest / under the son
Granted by the pope / in his bulls under led
Which pardon ye shall find / when ye are deed
That offers / outher gro^es or else pens
To these holy relyques / which or I go hens
I shall here show / in open audyence
Exortynge ye all / to do to them reverence
But first ye shall know well / yt I com fro Rome
^o here my bulls / al^ and some
Our lyege lord seal / here on my patent
I bear with me / my body to warant
That no man be so bo^de / be he priest or clarke
Me to dysturbe / of Christ's holy warke
Nor have no dysdayne / nor yet scorn
Of these holy relyques / which saints have worn
First here I show ye / of a holy Jews sheep
A bone / I pray you take good keep
To my words / and mark them well
If any of your bestes belyes do swell
Dip this bone in the water / that he does take
Into his body / and the swellynge shall s^ake
And if any worm / have ^our beestes stonge
Take of this water / and wasshe his tongue
And it will be hole anon / and furthermore
Of pockes and scabbes / and every sore
He shall be quyte hole / that drynketh of the well
That this bone is dipped in / it is treuth that I tell
And if any man that any best owes
Ones in the weke / or that the cock croweth
Fasting will drink / of this well a draughte
As that holy Jew has us taught
His beestes and his store / shall multeply
And masters all / it helps well
Though a man be foul / in ielous rage
Let a man with this water / make his potage
And neuermore shall he / his wife mystryst
Though he in sothe the faut by her wist
Or had she be take with freres two or three
Here is a mytten eke / as ye may se
He that his hand will put in this myttayn
He shall have / increase of his grayn
That he has sown / be it wete or ^^ys
So that he offer pens / or else grotes
And another holy relyke / eke here se ye may
The blessed a^me / of sweet saint sunday
And who so ever is blessed / with this right hand
Can not speed amysse / by se nor by land
And if he offers / eke with good devotion
He shall not fail / to come to high promocyon
And another holy relyke here may ye see
The great too / of the holy trynyte
And who so ever ones does it in his mouth take
Be shall never be dysseasyd / with the tothe ache
Canker nor pockys shall there none bread
This that I show ye / is matter in deed
And here is of our lady / a relyke full good
Her bongrace / which she ware with her french hode
When she went out / always for son bornynge
Women with child / which be in mourning
By virtue thereof / shall be sone easyd
And of their trauayll / full sone also releasyd
And if this bongrace / they do devoutly kys
And offer thereto / as their devotion is
Here is another relyke / eke a precious one
Hf all helowes / the blessed Iaw bone
Which relyke / without any fail
Against poison / chefely does prevail
For whom so ever it touches / without dout
All manner venym / from him shall issue out
So that it shall hurt / no manner wyghte
Lo of this relyke / the great power and might
Which preseruyth from poison every man
Lo of saint Myghell / eke the brayn pan
Which for the head ache / is a preseruatyfe
To every man or best / that beryth life
And further it shall stand him in better stead
For his head shall never ache when that he is deed
Nor he shall feel / no manner grefe nor pain
Though with a sword / one cleue it than a twayn
But be as one that lay in a deed sleep
Wherefore to these relykes / now com crouche and crepe
But look that ye offering to them make
Or else can ye no manner profit take
But one thing ye women all I warant you
If any wight / be in this place now
That has done syn / so horrible that she
Dare not for shame / thereof sheyuen be
Or any woman / be she young or old
That has made her husband cockolde
Such folk shall have / no power nor no grace
To offer to my relykes / in this place
And who so fyndyth / her self out of such blame
Com hither to me on crystes holy name
And because ye
Shall unto me
G^ue credence at the full
Mine auctoryte
Now shall ye se
Lo here the popes bull
Now shall the friar begin his sermon / and even at the same time the pardoner
begins also to show and speak of his bullys / and auctorytes com from Rome


Date et dabitur vobis
Good devout people / this place of scripture

Worshypfull masters / ye shall understand

Is to you / that have no litterature

That pope Leo the.x. has granted with his hand

Is to say / in our english tongue

And by his bulls / confyrmed under led

As depart your goods / the poor folk among

To all manner people / both quycke and deed

And god shall than / give unto you again

Ten thousand years / and as many ^entes of pardon

This in the gospel / so is written plain

When they are deed / their souls for to guardon

Therefore give your alms / in the largest wise

That will with their penny / or alms deed

Keep not your goods / fie fie on couetyse

Put to their hands / to the good speed

That sin with god is most abhomynable

Of the holy chapel of sweet saint Leonarde

And is eke the sin / that is most dampnable

Which late by fire / was destroyed and marde

In scripture eke / but I say syrs how

Ay by the mas / one can not here

What a babbling makes yonder fellow

For the babbling / of yonder folysshe friar

In scripture eke / is there many a place

And also masters / as I was about to tell

Which shows that many a man so farforth lacks grace

Pope July ye.vi. has granted fair and well

That when to them / god has abundaunce sent

And does.xii. thousand years of pardon to the^ send

They wo^de dystrybute none to the indygent

That ought / to this holy chapel lend

Whereat god having / great indygnacyon

Pope Bonyface / the.ix. also

Punysshed these men / after a diverse facyon

Pope July / pope Innocent / with diverse popes mo

As the gospel / full nobly does declare

Has granted / to the susteynynge of the same

How dives Epulus / reygnynge in welfare

v. thousand years of pardon / to every of you by name

And on his board / dysshes delycate

And clean remyssyon / also of their syn

Pore Lazarus / came beggynge at his gate

As often times / as you put in

Desiring some fode / his honger to releue

Any monye / into the pardoners cofer

But the rycheman / nothing would him give

Or any money up unto it offer

Not so much as a few crommys of bread

Or he that offeryth / penny or grote

Wherefore pore lazarus / of famyn strayth was deed

Or he that gives / the pardoner a new cote

And angels his soul / to heaven did carry

Or take of me / out^er image or letter

But now the rich man / of the contrary

Whereby this pore chapel may / fair the better

When he was deed / went to mysery and pain

And god wot / it is a full gracyous deed

Where for evermore / he shall remain

For which god / shall quyte you well your mede

In brennyng fire / which shall never cease

Now help our pore chapel / if it be your will

But I say thou pardoner / I bid the hold thy peace

And I say thou friar / hold thy tongue still

What stand thou there / all the day smatterynge

Mary what standyst thou there / all day clatterrynge

Mary fellow I com hyder / to prech the word of god
Which of no man / may be forbode
But hard with scylence / and good intent
For why / it techeth them euydent
The very way / and path that shall them led
Even to heaven gatys / as straight as any threde
And he that lettyth the word / of god of audyence
Stands accursed / in the great sentence
And so art thou / for enterruptynge me

Nay thou art a cursed / knave / and that shall thou se
And all such that to me / make interrupcyon
The pope sendes them / excommunycacyon
By his bullys / here ready to be read
By bysshoppes / and his cardynalles confyrmed
And eke if thou / dysturbe me any thing
Thou art also / a traitor to the king
For here has he granted me / under his broad seal
That no man / if he love his hele
Should me dysturbe / or let in any wise
And if thou do / the kings commandment despise
I shall make the be set / fast by the fete
And where thou saydyst / that thou art more mete
Among the people / here for to preche
Because thou do them / the very way teache
^ow to com / to heaven above
Therein thou lie / and that shall I prove
And by good reason / I shall make the bow
And know that I / am met^r than art thou
For thou / when thou have taught them ones the way
Thou e^rest not / wheth^r they com there ye or nay
But when that thou / have done all together
And taught them the way / for to com thither
Yet all that thou can ymagyn
Is but to use virtue / and to abstain fro syn
And if they fall ones / than thou can no more
Thou can not give them / a salve for their sore
But these my letters / be clean purgacyon
All though never so many sins / they have don
But when thou have taught them the way and all
Yet or they com there / they may have many a fall
In the way / or that they com thither
For why the way / to heaven is very slydder
But I will teache them after another race
For I shall bring them to heaven gate
And be their gydes / and conducte all things
And led them thither / by the purse strings
So that they shall not fall / though that they would

Hold thy peace knave / thou art very bold
Thou pratest in faith / even like a pardoner

Why despysest thou / the popes mynyster
Masters / here I curse him openly
And therewith warn / all this hole company
By the popes / great auctoryte
That ye leave him / and harken unto me
For till h^ be assoyled / his words take none effect
For out of holy church / he is now clean reiecte

My masters / he does but gest and rave
It forseth not / for the words of a knave
But to the word of god do reverence
And here me forth / with dew audyence

Masters I swewed you / ere while of alms deed

Masters this pardon / which I showed you before

And how ye should give poor folk at their need

Is the greatest that ever was / sith god was bore

And if of your parts / that thing ones were don

For why without confession or contrycyon

Dout not but god should give you retrybucyon

By this shall ye have / clean remyssyon

But now further / it ought to be declared

And forgyuen of the sins se^^n
Who be these pore folk that should have your reward

Come to this pardon / if ye will come to heaven

Who be those pore folk / of whom I speak and name

Come to this pardon if ye will be in blys

Certes we pore freres / are the same

This is the pardon / which ye can not mysse

We freres daily take pain I say

This is the pardon which shall men's souls wyn

We frears daily / do both fast and pray

This is the pardon / the rydder of your sin

We freres travail / and labor every hour

This is the pardon / that purchases all grace

We freres take pain / for the love of our savior

This is a pardon for all manner of trespass

We freres also go on lymytacyon

This is ye pardon / of which all mercy does spring

For to preche / to every christian nacyon

This is the pardon that to heaven shall ye bring

But I say thou pardoner / thou wylt keep sylens (sone)

Ye it is like to be when I have done

Mary therefore the more knave art thou I say
That parturbest / the word of god I say
(...) neither thy self / wylt here goddys doctrine
(...) suffer other / their earys to enclyne
^herfore our savior in his holy scripture
Clyueth the thy judgment / thou cursyd creature
Speaking to the / after this manner
Maledictus qui audit verbum dei negligenter
Woe be that man says our lord / that gives no audien^
Or heryth the word / of god with negligens

Now thou haste spoken all sir daw
I care not for the / an old straw
I had lever thou were hanged / up with a rope
Than I that am comen from the pope
And thereby gods minister / while thou sta^dest and prate
Should be fayn to knock without the gate
Therefore preche hardely / thy belly full
But I nevertheless / will declare the popes bull

Now my friends / I have before showed ye

Now my masters / as I have before declared

That good it is to give your charity

That pardoners from you may not be spared

And further I have / at lenghte to you told

Now here after / shall follow and ensew

Who be these people / that ye receive should

That follows of pardons / the great vertew

That is to say / us freres pore

We pardoners for your souls be as necessary

That for our living must beg fro door to door

As is the meat / for our bodies hungry

For of our own propre / we have no propre thing

For pardons is the thing that brings men to heaven

But that we get / of devout peoples getting

Pardons delyuereth them fro the sins seven

And in our place / be friars three score and three

Pardons for every crime / may dyspens

Which only live / on men's charity

Pardon purchasyth grace for all offense

For we friars / wylfull charity profess

Ye though ye had slain / both father and mothe^

We may have no money / another more nor less

And this pardon / is chief above all other

For wordly treasure we may naught care

For who to it offeryth / grote or penny

Our souls must be rich / and our bodies bare

Though sins / he had done never so many

And one thing I had almost left behind

And though that he had all his kyndred slain

Which before / came not to my mind

This pardon shall ryd the^ fro ever lasting pain

And doutles it is none other thing

There is no syn / so abhomynable

But when ye will give / your alms and offering

Which to remyt / this pardon is not able

Look that ye / dystrybute it wisely

As well declares / the sentence of this letter

Not to every man / that for it will cry

Ye can not therefore / bestow your money bette^

For if ye give / your alms in that wise

Let us not here / stand idle all the day

It shall not both to them and us suffyse

Give us some money / or that we go our way

But I say / thou lewd fellow thou
Had none other time to show thy bulls but now
Can not tarry and abide till sone
And read them than when prechynge is done

I will read them now / what say thou thereto
Have thou any thing therewith to do
Thynkest that I will stand / and tarry for thy leisure
Am I bound to do so much for thy pleasure

For my pleasure? nay I would thou knewyst it well
It becomes the knave / never a dell
To prate thus boldly in my presence
And let the word / of god of audience

Let the word of god quoth a? nay let a horso^ dreuyll
Prate here all day / with a foul evil
And all thy sermon / goth on couetyce
And byddest men beware of auaryce
And yet in thy sermon / do thou none other thing
But for alms stand all the day beggynge

Leave thy realynge I would the advise

Nay leave thou thy babbling / if thou be wise

I would thou knew it knave / I will not leave a (whyt)

No more will I / I do the well to wit

It is not thou / shall make me hold my peace

Tha^ speak on hardly if thou thynkyst it for thy (...)

For I will speak / whyther thou wylt or no

In faith I care not / for I will speak also

Wherefore hardely / let us both go to

Se which shall be better hard of us two

What should ye give ought to pratyng pardoners

What should ye spend on these flaterynge liars

What should ye give ought to these bold beggars

As be these babbling monks / and these freres

Let them hardely labor for their living

Which do naught daily / but babble and lie

It much hurtyth them / good mennys gyuynge

And tell you fables dear inoughe a fly

For that makes them idle / and slothful to warke

As does this babbling friar / here to day

That for none other thing they will carke

^

Hardely they would go both to plow and carry

On us pardoners hardely do your cost

And if of necessity ones they felt the smarte

For why / your money never can be lost

But we freres be not in like estate

For why / there is in our fraternity

For our hands with such things we may not macu (late)

For all brethren and sisteren that thereof be

We freres be not in like condition

Devoutly song every year

we may have no prebendes ne exhibition

As he shall know well that comes there

Of all temporal service are we forbode

At every of the five solemn festes

And only bound to the service of god

A mass and dirige to pray for the good rest

And therewith to pray for every christen nation

Of the souls of the brethren and sisteren all

That god witsafe to save them fro dampnation

Of our fraternity in general

But some of you so hard be of heart

with a hearse there standing / well arrayed and dyght

Ye can not weep though ye full sore smarte

And torches and tapers about it brennynge bright

wherefore some man must ye hyre needs

And with the belles eke solempnely ryngynge

which must intrete god for your misdedes

And prestes and clerks devoutly singing

Ye can hyre no better in mine oppinion

And furthermore / every night in the year

Than us gods servants / men of religion

Twelve pore people are received there

And specially god hereth us pore freres

And there have both harborow and food

And is attentife unto our desires.

That for them is convenient and good

For the more of religion / the more herd of our lord

And furthermore / if there be any other

And that is / so should / good reason does accord

That of our fraternity be sister or brother

Therefore doubt not masters / I am even he

(...) after hap to fall in decay

To whom ye should part with your charity

And if he than chance to come that way

we freres be they that should your alms take

Nygh unto our foresaid holy place

which for your souls he^th do both watch and wake

Ye shall there tarry for amon these space

we freres pray / god wot when ye do sleep

And be there found of the places cost

we for your sins do both sobbe and weep

wherefore now in the name of the holy ghost

To pray to god for mercy and for grace

I advise you all that now here be

And thus do we daily with all our hole place

For to be of our fraternity

wherefore distribute of your temporal welthe

Fie on couetise / stick not for a penny

By which ye may preserve your souls health

For which ye may have benefits so many

I say wylt thou not yet stynt thy clappe
Pu^l me down the pardoner with an evil hap

Master friar / I hold it best
To keep your tongue while ye be in rest

I say one pull the knave of his stole

Nay one pull the friar down like a fool

Leave thy railynge and babbelynge of freres
Or by Iys Ish lug the by the sweet ears

By god I would thou durst presume to it

By god a little thing might make me to do it

And I shrew thy heart and thou spare

By god I will not mysse the much thou slouche
And if thou play me such another touch
Ish knock the on the costarde / I would thou it knew

Mary that would I se quod blind hew

Well I will begin / and than let me se
whether thou dare again interrupte me
And what thou would ones to it say

Begin and prove whether I will ye or nay

And to go forth where as I left right now

Because some percase will think amysse of me

Our lord in the gospel shows the way how

Ye shall now here / the popys auctoryte

By gogges soul knave / I suffer the no longer

I say some good body / lend me his hengar
And I shall him teache by god almyght
How he shall a another time learn for to fight
I shall make that balde crown of his to look read
I shall leave him but one ere / on his head

But I shall leave the never an ere or I go

Ye horeson friar / wylt thou so
Than the fight.

Lose thy hands / away from mine earys

Than take thou thy hands away from my here is
Nay abide thou hor^son I am not down yet
I trust first to lie the at my fete

Ye horeson / wylt thou scrat and byte

Ye mary will I / as long as thou doste smite
The curate.

Hold your hands / a vengeance on ye both two
That ever ye came hither / to make this a do
To polute my church / a myschyefe on you light
I swear to you by god all might
Ye shall both repent / every vain of your heart
As sore as ye did / ever thing or ye depart

Master parson / I maruayll ye will give license
To this false knave / in this audience
To publysh his ragman rolls with lies
I desired him ywys / more than ones or twyse
To hold his peace / till that I had done
^ut he would here no more than the man in the moon

Why should I suffer the / more than thou me
Master parson gave me license before the
And I would thou knewyst it / I have relykes here
Other manner stuff / than thou do bear
I will edefy more / with the sight of it
Than will all the pratynge of holy wryt
For that except that the precher / him self live well
His predycacyon will help never a dell
And I know well / that thy living is naught
Thou art an apostata / if it were well sought
An homycyde thou art I know well inoughe
For my self knew where thou sloughe
A wenche with thy dagger in a couche
And yet as thou say in thy sermon yt no man shall touch

No more of this wranglyng in my chiyrch
I shrewe your hartys both / for this l^^rche
Is there any blood shed here between these knaves
Thanked be god / they had no stauys
Nor egoteles / for than it had been wrong
Well ye shall sing another song
Neybour prat / com hither I you pray

Why / what is this nyse fraye

I can not tell you / one knave dysdaynes another
Wherefore take ye the tone / and I shall take the other
We shall bestow them / there as is most conuenyent
For such a couple / I trow they shall repent
That ever they met in this church here
Neyboure ye be constable / stand ye nere
Take ye that lay knave / and let me alone
With this gentylman / by god and by saint John^
I shall borowe upon prestholde somewhat
For I may say to the neybour prat
It is a good deed to punysh such to the ensample
Of such other / how that they shall mell
In like facyon as these catyfes do

In good faith master parson / if ye do so
Ye do but well / to teache them to beware

Master prat I pray ye me to spare
For I am sorry / for that that is done
Wherefore I pray ye forgive me sone
For that I have offendyd within your lybertye
And by my truth sir / ye may trust me
I will never come hither more
while I live and god before

Nay I am ones charged with the
Wherefore by saint John^ thou shall not escape me
Till thou have scouryd a pare of stokys

Tut he weneth all is but mockes
Lay hand on him / and com ye on sir friar
Ye shall of me hardely have your hyre
Ye had none such this.vii. year
I swear by god / and by our lady dear

Nay master parson / for goddys passion
Entreat not me after that facyon
For if ye do it will not be for your honesty

Honesty or not / but thou shall se
What I shall do by and by
Make no stroglynge / com forth soberly
For it shall not avail the I say

Mary that shall we try / even strayt way
I defy the chur^e preeste / and there be no mo than thou
I will not go with the / I make god a vow
We shall se first which is the stronger
God has sent me bonys I do the not fere

Ye by thy faith / wylt thou be there
Neybour prat bring forth that knave
And thou sir friar if thou wylt algatys rave

Nay chorle I the defy
I shall trouble the first
Thou shall go to prison by and by
Let me se now do thy worste

Help help neybour prat neybour prat
In the worship of god / help me somewhat

Nay deal as thou can with that elfe
For why I have inoughe to do my self
Alas for pain I am almost deed
The reed blood so ronneth down about my head
Nay and thou can I pray the help me

Nay by the mas fellow it will not be
I have more tow on my dystaffe / tha^ I can well spyn
The cursed friar does the upper hand wyn

Will ye leave than / and let us in peace depart

Ye by our lady / even with all our heart

Than adieu to the devil till we come again

And a myschefe go with you both twain.
