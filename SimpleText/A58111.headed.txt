GAllants, I vow I am quite out of heart,
I Have not one smutty Jest in all my part.
Here Is not one Scene of tickling Rallery;
There we quite lose the Pit and Gallery,
His London Cuckolds did afford you sport.
That pleased the Town, and did divert the Court.
But 'cause some squeamish Females of renown
Made visits with design to cry it down,
He swore in's Rage he would their humors fit,
And write the next without one word of Wit.
No Line in this will tempt your minds to Evil,
It Is true, it is dull, but then it is very civil.
No double sense shall now your thoughts beguile,
Make Lady Blush, nor Ogling Gallant Smile.
But mark the Fate of this mis-judging Fool!
A Bawdy Play was never counted Dull,
Nor modest Comedy e're pleased you much,
It Is relished like good Manners amongst the Dutch.
In you, Chaste Ladies, then we hope to day,
This is the Poets Recantation Play
Come often to it that he at length may see
It Is more than a pretended Modesty
Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter,
He quickly will his way of writing alter;
And every Play shall send you blushing home,
For, tho you rail, yet then we are sure you will come,
Thus Brides are Coy and Bashful the first night,
But used to it once, are mad for their delight.
Do not the Whiggish Nature then pursue,
Lest like Whig-Writer, he desert you too.
Whig-Poet when he can no longer Thrive,
Turns Cat in Pan and writes his Narrative.
No Irish Witness sooner shall recant,
Nor oftener play the Devil or the Saint.

'TWas Prudently done of you Yesterday (when Mr. Gerrald came to know what was
become of his Pistols) to send down word you was gone into the City, by that I
gained time to get 'em Painted, as also the Table in the Closet, where they are
to be found


That Is well done.


I have got the Picture of Mr. Vallentine that has the Pistols, who took 'em
away only because he believed the other party would not fail coming to you to
know how they were lost; and the Jest is, he thinks he stole 'em-so cunningly,
that if you discover the Theft, he will think you the greatest Sorceress in the
world: and this my Care and Diligence has found out


Well, Mr. Decoy, It shall not be out of your way.


Nay, I spoke not as to that, it is sufficient we understand one another; the
multitudes of Fools who daily flock to you, cry you up on all sides


There Is not one but this Mr. Gerrald that speaks against me, and he rails at
me where e're he comes


Though you are no Sorceress, yet you have the wit to make the World think so,
and that is the same thing as if you really were one


I am much beholden to Beatrice for it; well, she is an admirable Wench to draw
Fools into the Net, she affects an innocent, simple carriage, which makes 'em
believe twenty silly Stories


I always said Beatrice was a Treasure; but pray how goes the Business of the
Marriage which the jealous Lady would so sain prevent


The misfortunes which I foretold to the Countess (who has been my Client a
great while) have disheartened her enough already; she is to come again to know
the effects of a pretended Consultation that I am to have with a Spirit which I
make her believe is my Intelligence, and acquaints me with every thing, and in
this Business I have a double advantage, for she not only pays me for this, but
the Lady Noble, who secretly loves the Colonel, fees me to hinder the Marriage
by virtue of my Art


You are not the only Person that takes Bribes on both sides.


Have you got those Paintings here that are for carrying on the business of the
Pistols we talked of


Let Mr. Gerrald come when he will, every thing is in readiness as I told you;
nor have I been wanting in my Endeavors to procure you another Carcass, I have
been with the Executioner, and he has promised me another dead Body fresh from
the Gallows, he will send it you as soon as Execution is over; that trick once
more will make you famous as long as you live


I Will study a fit occasion to employ it to my best advantage. Be gone.


WHat News Mrs. Hellen?


Ah Dame Dobson, I am almost out of breath, I slipped out at our back door, and
came running to acquaint you, that the Countess is instantly coming to you


Let her come, I am prepared what to say, being such a Credulous person as I
know she is; let her Marry him after that if she dare


Yes, but you don't know that the Colonel whom she would be well enough pleased
with for a Husband, comes along with her in disguise of her Footman, whom she
has promised to make happy, if he can any ways convince her, that what you do
is all but a Cheat; and he has disguised himself to try if you or any of your
Devils are Cunning enough to discover him; therefore be upon your guard


I am glad to hear this, for it saves me a great deal of trouble, and in the
hurry of business I might not have taken the pains to have found it out. But
does not the Countess think you suspect our Correspondence


How should she? I am always speaking against you to her; I say daily to her,
that it is by mere chance if you tell any thing true, and to convince me of my
error, she runs over all the particular remarkable things of her life, which
she pretends you have given her an account of; but little thinks she all this
while that it is from me you know 'em


I could with long study. But because this business is in haste, and requires
all our diligence, it is the more ready way to know all by your Intelligence,
and cuts out work short


O well thought on too, I had like to have forgot to tell you, that after she
has conversed with you barefaced, she will presently come again in a Mask; and
I am to be with her in a Mask too. I Will point at you with my finger, or make
some other sign by which you shall know us: Besure fail not, but tell the same
misfortunes as formerly


I Will warrant you.


Your Countess is come.


I Will be gone then out at the back door. I Will not fail to bring you an exact
account of everything they say when they return home


Beatrice bring 'em in here, and tell 'em I have been shut up in private this
good while


Please you to walk in here. --


WHere is Mrs. Dobson?


Your Honor must have a little Patience.


Is any one with her?


No, an please your Honor; but she has locked her self up in her black Garret,
taken her great Book, and called for a glass of Water, I suppose she is at work
for your Honor


I Will expect then, Pray when she comes forth, let me be the first that speaks
with her


I Will go and watch her coming forth for that purpose.


I vow and protest Colonel, I am very much troubled to see you in this dress;
if any one should come and know you, what would they say


There is no danger of that, I came in a Chair, I run no hazard of being known,
but you might have saved the trouble of this disguise if you would have given
less Credit to this Canting she-Fortune-teller, who invents a company of idle
stories only to get your Money


You will have it then that Fortune Tellers are Cheats.


It Is their Profession, they can tell nothing, and only work upon the Credulity
of People they meet with


But examine the Case a little, what reason can this Woman have think you, to
hinder my marrying of you


I know not, unless I have some secret Rival that would supplant me* And I
cannot imagine how your Woman Mrs. Hellen, should be more quick of apprehension
than your Honor; She tells you daily you converse with an Ignorant prating
Woman, one, that if you believe, the world will censure you for your easiness


Hellen's a Fool, and has no reason to say so; for after those Truths this
Woman has told me, so often I ought to Credit her; Do not therefore persist in
persuading me to render my self unhappy by Marriage that would prove so
disastrous


The misfortune that will make us both unhappy, is, that you will believe her.


You have heard my Reasons, and you see I take all care possible thoroughly to
inform my self for your sake, and endeavor more particularly to know what sort
of Mischiefs they are that would ensue such an Engagement, and if it be a
fatality that cannot be avoided, my resolution depends on what she shall now
say; and all this I have done that you may no longer have a pretense to say
that what she does, is all but Artifice and Cheat


I doubt not but we shall presently know the truth of that to both our
satisfactions. Besure to question her about me, I am certain her Devil can
inform her nothing of my disguise. And as to Mr. Gerrald that came to you last
Night, do you think she will tell him where to find his Pistols again


Why not?


He neither believes, nor hopes it himself.


If she should not tell him who took 'em, I should not believe her a Cheat, for
that she is not obliged to know every thing; It suffices me that she never
tells any thing but what is true


I submit Madam, I now begin to be convinced, that she has some Witchcraft in
her; for certainly if she had not set a spell upon you, you could never be so
zealous in her Justification; for my part, I know not what can be done more to
undeceive you


Silence, she is coming down, go further off.


SHow those Ladies into the next Room, I Will come to 'em anon.


Well, my dear Dame Dobson, have you done what you can for me?


Your Honor forgets your Servant is here; Friend wait without.


No, Pray let him stay here, though I have great Confidence in you, yet I
should dye with fear if some body I know were not by me to encourage me a
little


Why did you not bring your Woman with you?


Well, what have you to tell me now, I tremble for fear it should be ill News.


Your Honor may choose whether you will believe me, or not; but let me tell
you, Death, Ruin and Bloodshed will attend your Nuptials, if you proceed in
this Marriage


Say you so, But cannot these things be prevented?


No, you may run the risque if you please, I have given you fair warning.


But pray tell me, what sort of Misfortune will follow if we proceed?


They wholly relate to the Person you love, when he Marries he will love his
Wife so, that he will be jealous to the highest degree


He is not in the least inclined to Jealousy.


I tell thee he will be jealous, and so excessively jealous, that his Wife
shall never enjoy one minutes quiet; 'Twill be his fortune to kill a man of
considerable Quality, and an intimate Friend of his Wives, whom he will find one
Evening discoursing with her; for which he will lose his Head


Lose his Head! there is an end then, I Will not marry him. --


And this misfortune will not only happen to him infallibly in marrying of you;
but if he marry any other Woman. Now it lies in your power to prevent all this
if you have him


I Will not marry him, that is for certain; but pray tell me, can you resolve me
one thing, I would fain know what that Party is now a doing


What shall I get by telling you a thing that you will believe is all by ghess?


Ne'rtheless, 'twill please me very well to hear, and 'twill confirm my belief
in all the rest when I shall enquire, and be assured that his actions agree
with your words


Are you of a Spirit not to be daunted?


It may be I may.


Then send away your Footman, and your own Eyes shall presently inform you what
your Lover is doing, but be not frighted, for the Apparition shall not be very
terrible


What, see the Devil! I am ready to dye at the very apprehension.


He shall be very civil, have a good heart.


I thank you for that, I would not see the Devil for all the world!


I Will run up to my Chamber then, and bring you word presently what I see in my
Magic Glass


Well what will your Honor wager now, that her Devil lets he^ see what I am
doing? You wanted assurance or you might have discovered the Cheat before she
went out of the Room


You would have had me have ventured then to have seen the Devil! --


Yes.


But she would have put you out of the Room, and I should have been alon^ with her.


Is not that an Argument of her Cheating doings; She Will only practic^ before
Women whose reason is overcome by their fear, and will not admit so much as a
Footman to be by


Let me advise you to look well to your self, I shall ever have a particular
Esteem and Friendship for you: But what censure soever I undergo of be ing too
credulous, I will never be the occasion of your killing any Man on my account;
nor of your being Beheaded


Is It possible then that you believe all this?


You think she is a Cheat, but what if she finds out that you are not the
person you seem, and that you are come here in disguise, what will you say then


She Will not dream of that I warrant you, her Astrological Spectacles will fail
her there


It may be so; but if it falls out otherwise, will you then promise me never to
Marry


And if it happens as I say, will your Honor promise me to Marry me?


Whist, she is coming.


I Have very strange News to tell you.


What pray, let me know it quickly?


I have seen your Lover.


And how?


He is upon some Design, for he has put himself in the habit of a Footman, and
is in earnest Discourse with a Lady


How Is that, in the habit of a Footman talking to a Lady!


Perhaps he will deny it to you when you tax him with it, but be positive n't,
for it is so, nothing is more certain


I do believe you, you never told me any thing yet but what was certainly true.


They stood sidelong to me as they were talking, and therefore I could ^ot see
their faces, to tell you what features either of 'em have


This is sufficient, and I Will trouble you with no more Questions at pre^ent, I
am in such a wonder, that I know not what to say, I Will take my leave; ^omorrow
I Will come again to know the whole Concern


Hereafter bring one of your Women with you, I care not for Li^ery-men.


It shall be so no more.


The business is done, the Countess is gone, and han't a word to say*


I heard all from my stand, I am very much mistaken if the Two hun^red pounds
are not our own, now she is absolutely off from the Marriage, ^t us now be upon
our Guard, for the Colonel being enraged at her refusal to ^arry him, will do
all he can to discover our practice: And whether he comes himself, or sends any
body else upon Design; we shall have enough to do to look to our hits


Here Is a kind of Citizen would speak with you.


What manner of man is he?


A little Queerish upon the City Cut.


I Will return to my hiding hole, it is for certain the Courageous Woo^be, that I
told you of this morning. If it be he, I Will com^e forth and play my part. He Will
be no lean Fool, he will bast well in the Roasting


Bid him come in.


GOod Morrow to you Madam.


The like to you Sir.


They say you are a Wise woman, and know every thing; if so, you must know my
Mistress, one that I am a Suitor to


What of her?


She is one that loved me formerly.


And you loved her a little.


Right -- I find she is a Witch --


She could not choose but return your love.


I am no very ugly person, besides, I have a Tongue well enough hung.


No doubt you have a good toward wit of your own.


Nay, I am like my Father for that, I know both when, where, how and what, as
occasion shall serve. But as to my Mistress, I would fain have married her -- I
need not tell you that neither -- But since she has been acquainted with a
certain sort of People that are come from Tangier and France, who talk of
nothing but Campaigns, Sieges and Battles, would you believe it; she is in a
manner ashamed of my Company, and they nothing but make Sport and laugh and
jeer her out of conceit with me; and -- now and then I have a devilish mind to
be at some of them; But because I have never been in the Army, nor used to
Fighting, I let 'em alone for fear I should be beaten; and for that reason I
hold my Tongue


You have a great deal of Prudence upon my word: But why don't you pass a
Campaign in the Wars, that would teach you to be as brisk and as brave as the
best of 'em. You only want being flesht


Yes, but --


I find you want Courage.


Pray Pardon me there, for I have as much Courage as any man can have; If
anybody angers me, I warrant you I shall not speak to 'em in half a year after


But it may be you may have the Discretion never to show your stoutness.


But I have been in the Artillery Ground three or four times in Buff and when I
have come home, I have shot off my Musket in the Street that I have made the
very Houses shake again -- when -- I am naturally inclined to the Wars, and
there is scarce a Night passes but I dream of fighting and killing, and never
am alone in the dark, but am throwing my Arms about, and striking as if I was
beating of this man, and that man, and the other man --


That demonstrates your Inclination, and it is a fair Prognostic.


And the other day being alone in my Chamber, armed Cap a-pee, as I came from
Training, seeing my self in the Glass, methoughts I had such a Marshal Air, and
looked so like a Warrior, I was extremely pleased, and could not forbear
Skirmishing against the great Raw-bon'd people in the Hangings, I made an Ass
of Sampson with his Jaw Bone. And I find I could be as sharp upon real persons,
but that there is one little difficulty I cannot overcome. --


What is that?


A Musket Shot or a Cannon Bullet never minds where it goes, it kills a stout
man as soon as another, that now is very foolish


But what would you have me do for you?


No great matter, it is only to give me a Charm to make me Sword and Cannon
proof


You Would be invulnerable then!


Ay invulnerable, I know it is nothing to you. --


I confess I have a secret, but there are certain difficulties.


Pough, no; How many Hundreds are there in the Wars that have Charms, and come
home safe every day


How do you know they have Charms?


Well enough, would they be such Fools else think you, to run upon Cannon
mouths, and stand with their Breasts against Muskets to be shot at? --


You see many are killed every day.


Ay, a number of poor Rogues that had not money to go to the price of 'em; or a
Company of Hectoring Bullies without fear or wit, that scorn to be beholden to
any body, you may be sure they that are killed had no Charms; and Dame pray be
free with me, don't you now and then do such a Kindness


I confess ingeniously I do; but because it is a great secret in Nature, it
will cost you dear


For Money I can do well enough, my Father's an Alderman, he is called
Christopher Gillet, and if through your means I can bring the Name of the
Gillets into Reputation, trust you to me for your reward


I have that, not far off, which will do your business, but be sure you never
tell any body, how, or from whom you have it, if you do, the Charm will vanish


Pough, Do you take me for a fool, or no; somebody shall find now I have
Courage


Within there -- Bring me one of those Swords that hang up on the Wall, under
the Planet Mars


O He Is the God of War --


Yes, they have Charms belong to 'em, and are enchanted, I have not above two
left, the Wars have swept 'em all away, and 'twill cost me Six Months labor to
prepare more


And when I have one of them, need not I be afraid?


No, if any body affront you, do but draw, and they shall run away, or be
disarmed if they stay


That Is just as I would have it; Since it is so, I Will not fear any man that
wears a head, and you shall have the Credit on it


The world shall talk of nothing but your Bravery; Sir there, take it; but
stay, when you have occasion to use it, put but your Thumb against the guard,
grasping the handle with your fore-fingers, and close 'em fast with your little
finger


Is it thus I must hold it?


Hold it fast firm, close there, your thumb stiff against the guard, right as
can be; In that consists the Charm


Ah you shall see how I Will manage it, ha, ha, ha.


Though you should chance to hit your Enemies but upon the Shins, yet shall the
point run diametrically through his Heart


And you will secure me I shall never be killed?


I Will assure your life as long as you follow my Directions, and hold your Thumb
as I showed you


WHither go you Sir? Nobody is to come up here without giving me notice first,
and having my leave


I come to you about Business --


But Sir, I am not at leisure. --


I am in have, my Business is urgent, and therefore Sir, if you please, depart
the-Room


No Sir, I don't please (methinks I am a little faint-hearted still.


What little Prigg is this with a Sword by his side, and that City Dough-bak't
face


Never mind what he says, take no notice of him.


Do you know good Mr. Citt, that I shall tumble you down Stairs if you don't
rubb. --


Perhaps Sir (Courage Gillet, Courage)


Sir, I have Business with the Gentleman. --


That Is pleasant, Business with him? --


If I had no more Wit now than you.


What say you? --


No disturbance pray, let us go into the next Room, he will stay till we have
done. --


No, I Am resolved to stay here, and if he does not soon remove his fools head
out of my sight, I Will throw him out at Window. --


If you anger me a little more (Now Sword, now Gillet, now, now. --


What Is that you (...) to your self there?


What Is that to you, i^ you go to that --


Then there is that to you.


Gillet, to him Gillet.


You look as if you had a mind to draw. --


Firm, fast, Thumb stiff against the Guard.


What mean you, Sir, will you undo me? I beseech you spare him, have mercy on
him


No, my Honor will not suffer it; therefore -- Ah Coward, dare you not stand your
ground? Take you your Sword again, you see I have disarmed you, and can kill you
if I please


But pray spare his life, you have the better, and that is Honor enough.


A Pox of all ill luck, that my Sword should fly out of my hand.


Take It up again if you please, I fear no man that wears a head, I am ready for
you again


You Will depart peaceably if I give you your Sword?


On my Honor..... I shall meet that Spark another time.


Are you satisfied in my Art now, Sir?


Dear Dame, you have made me a happy Man, would you were a Queen or an Empress;
There, there is my Purse, take what you please


You are so generous, and so much a Gentleman, that it troubles me that you had
such a Box on the Ear


That was none of the Swords fault; and so long I care not; I am satisfied if I
had drawn it sooner, I had not had the Box on the Ear


Ay that is certain.


Now let any of the Flanders Bullies, or Tangierines laugh at me if they dare.


But Mr. Gillet, have a care of being too brisk, killing a Man you know brings
one into a great deal of trouble


You say true.


Therefore you had better change your course of life, and go to the Wars; after
one Campaign or two you may come to be Colonel of a Regiment, perhaps a
General


A General!


Yes, a General!


Shall I live to see the Name of Gillet in the Gazetts, what a joy would that
be to my old Father and Mother? I Will run and get me some other Accoutrements
presently, I long now to see my self like a Cavalier


You Will be an absolute Hero.


But who is this comes in so briskly? Shall I turn him down Stairs?


HOw Sir! you turn me down Stairs! --


Heah --


And heah too, what sort of Fellow's this? what a Figure he is.


A Figure Sir? -- If once my Sword begins to lay about, it runs Diametrically
through your Heart


Go, go, would you offer to kill a man that cannot defend himself? you know it is
impossible for him to resist you: Go and fight for your Mistress, and take her
from your Rivals


Well remembered, I Will go and kill half a dozen Rivals presently, Marry my
Mistress, beat her into better manners, and live like a Hero all the rest of my
life, Adieu


What foolish whimsical fellow was this?


One that has been troubling me here a good while. But what pray brings you
here, I cannot but wonder at that. --


I have a suit to you.


What Is that?


Only to be beholden to your Art to resolve me one Question.


Alas Sir, I am an ignorant Woman, and know nothing, my Art is mere Gullery,
you know it, and have said so a Thousand times


If you tell me right as to a Theft that has been committed two days since, I
promise to change my Opinion, and never to speak against you as long as I live


Have you lost any thing then?


Yes, a pair of Pistols, and the best that ever were made, and for which I
would be willing to give double the price they cost


You Would willingly have'em again, but my Art does not extend so far, I have no
Skill


My Pistols, I beseech you my Pistols.


How should I tell you where they are? I concern my self in Matter of another
Nature, in relation to good or evil fortune


Come lay aside your Passion, and be not angry, do what I request.


You deserve it well at my hands. But within there, Bring me a Basin of Water.
Well Sir, you your self shall see the thing distinctly, and because you shall not
think that I have any interest to deceive you, I declare beforehand I Will have
none of your Money


I understand what is fit. --


Come Sir, here is what is requisite -- Are things in readiness.


Proceed with Courage, nothing is wanting.


Stand in this fashion as I do, and fix your Eyes upon the Water without moving
them off. See you nothing now


Nothing.


Nothing at all! you don't look right then; for I see as plainly as can be.


You may see what you please, but it is I am to see; O I begin to see now, I see
my Pistols lying upon a Table in a Closet, where to my thinking I have been
some time or other, I -- I see nothing now again, where shall I go to (...) 'em,
I cannot call the place to mind


I think I have done enough to let you see the place where the Pistols are.


But I had rather you would have shown me the Thief that stole 'em, then
'twou'd have been no great trouble to get 'em again


Now my hand's in, I will not do things by halfs for you: Look you in the
Glass, but without turning away your eyes, for the Figure of him that took your
Pistols will appear but a moment; what do you see


Ha! It Is Valentine, an intimate Friend of mine. The other day I hid a Sword of
his in jest, and he to requite me, has watched his opportunity and taken my
Pistols to make me look for 'em, I Will run to his Lodgings presently


You may go with Confidence, I never fail to tell right.


You will be no loser by this piece of Service, I am counted a man not easily
to be cozened, and 'twill be no small reputation to have Converted a man of my
Principles: At present I take my leave without farther Ceremony


So he is gone, this passed cleverly.


He Is more than half won already: And if once I bring him over to my side, away
goes he to the Countess, and I doubt not but what he tells her of the business
of the Basin will induce her belief to all I shall tell her hereafter. But now
whilst we have time, let us take order that every thing may be in readiness to
deceive the rest, that I am promised to be brought here to day


Ay, Aye, we shall have more Woodcocks in the Spring anon, I warrant you.


YOur continual Bounty so obliges me, that my Inclinations are wholly to serve
your Ladyship


You are not to reckon the Present I make you now for any part of my former
Promise; Nor shall I think the Two hundred pound a sufficient Reward for your
trouble, if you can prevent this Marriage


I use all the Skill I have.


I am convinced you do, I have some faithful Spies about the Colonel, and they
tell me already, the Countess has declared, That she will never Marry him; but
whilst my old Man lives, I cannot have the least pretension imaginable; yet
what from what you have often told me, I have flattered my self all along with
the hopes of his Death, for then nothing will hinder, but that I may own my
love for the Colonel


Though your old gray Beard is not underground, yet I assure that in few Months
you shall be a Widow, and that the Colonel shall not Marry the Countess


But I have one scruple yet, which I had like to have forgot, and that came in
my head last Night as I was going to sleep* which if you clear, will add much
to my Satisfaction


What is that?


You have assured me that my Husband shall dye shortly, but not that he shall
dye before me; I fear you took his life into consideration, but concerned not
your self with mine


It Is right as you say, I did not indeed, but your Youth and Health gives you
fair assurance in that point: However my next scrutiny into the Secrets of Fate
shall be to know who shall dye first, you or your Husband; is not the question
stated to your mind now


Yes, Pray be speedy in it --


I Will send to you in few hours.


Adieu then for the present; some one is coming to you --


Your Ladyship may rest assured of my Service. --


Here Is one will press in, he would take no denial.


GOd give you good Den, is it you, I pray, that is called my Dame Dobson?


Yes pretty Maiden, I am she.


I entreat you then to dispatch me quickly, for I am to return to my Aunt who
stays for me with her Husband, who is a Servant to as great a Lord as any
belongs to the Court; I told 'em I would but step and see a Cousin of mine, who
is out at Nurse-keeping at this end of the Town, and would come to 'em
presently


Very good! and what would you with me?


What would I? --


Yes.


I am mis-inform'd I see, -- but perhaps you will not do any thing for me because
I am but a Country body


No, no, Sweetheart. I Will do as much for thee as for any Duchess (...) what is
your Business


Nay, but you are not that Dame Dobson that is the Cunning Woman. --


Come, come tell me your business, I am she you looked for; I am the Cunning
Woman


Nay surely but you are not, for she that I looked for, knows every thing; for
when I have been at our Landlord's house, where I promise you great Persons
come every day, I have list'ned at the Doors, when they have been talking, and
have heard 'em say, she could tell every manner of thing in the World


They said true, and there is none of my Name professes the A^t but my self.


Why don't you divine then for me, I don't ask you to do it for nothing, for
you can tell well enough that I Will pay you for it, and that a certain Person
gives me Money unknown to my Mother, or any body but my own sen


I know that very well, and also that that person has a great Kindness for you.


Nay, since you know that, you know all.


Yes, I know all, and you wish well to that certain person too, you know
something


Should not I love them that love me? he has told me so a hundred times, and
will sigh and be as melancholy as any thing, and says if I don't love him
again, I shall be the death of him; And he being a fine handsome Gentleman, I
would not have him dye for never so much, no indeed. --


It would be a great deal of Cruelty. --


And it would go near to break my Ladies heart, he is her only Son.


But what do you do now to hinder him from dying?


I meet him sometimes in the Barn, and let him play with me, and put his hand
down my Neck, and into my Bosom, and chuck me under the Chin, and kiss me; and
sometimes he will kiss me till he almost stifles me


And sometimes unties your Garter. --


I see you know it without my telling; but that was never but once, when he
asked me to see my Leg. -- And then he pincht me by the thigh that it was black
and blew again


Would he hurt you then? -- --


O, but he did not mean any harm, for all the while he lay kissing me, as if he
would have kissed the breath out of my body, and called me his Dear life and
Soul; he did so tremble, and his hand was so soft and warm me thought


And this is all you ever did for him! -- He never asked you any more?


Only to love him. --


And that you do to be sure. --


Yes; but it is but two days since I told him so, for I had a mind to know
first if he loved me indeed and indeed; but when I told him he was so pleased,
so pleased. --


I believe it, you found him very Courteous. --


O then he hugged me, and squeezed me, and sucked my very breath out, and said if
I would do something, as that he would tell me another time, he would Marry me. --


But when my little Maiden?


You can tell me when, and that is it I come to know of you.


Hark you Sweet heart! don't let him have his will of you till thou art his
Wife


I am too young yet, he says; and therefore I have such a mind to -- have*


Have a care of your self, or you will be undone.


Why? what harm can it be for me more than all the great Maids in o^ Parish?
why may not I have 'em as well as they


I am at a loss again, I am more puzzled with this silly Girl, than w^ the
cunningest Customer I have


How much must I give you pray now for doing it? If you will have Money before
hand, see I have brought a piece of Gold here


I know what it is you would have, but persons that come to me for anything, must
ask me for it by Name, that I may be sure I have their full consent and liking
to what I do


An't it all one if I tell you afterward?


No, there is a great difference in that.


I cannot abide to ask you, do something for me without -- there is my Piece of
Gold for you. I Will give it you all if you will do it for me without naming. --


Be not ashamed, out with it, nobody hears.


No, give me my Money again, I had rather never have great Bubbies as long as I
live, than ask for 'em my self. --


There it is out at last. -- The thing that you would ask of me is, that you may
have full-Breasts, that I would make 'em grow for you, that they may rise up
round and plump, like some of your Companions


O dear, O dear, I am so ashamed --


I have such a Kindness for you, that I promise you, you shall, and for a Charm
to make 'em grow, you must stroke 'em every morning before you get up, and say
three times fasting, Grow Breasts, grow; Rise Bubbies rise; Can you remember
this? --


Grow Breasts grow, Rise Bubbies rise; Methinks they begin to swell a little
already. --


Go your ways, Pretty one, assure your self that within three or four Months
your Breasts shall rise and be as round and as hard as the very Turnips that
grow in your Garden


O dear -- that you should know we have Turnips grow in our Garden too.


You see I know every thing.


Well, now my heart's at ease, 'twill be but a little while now before I am
Married, for Mr. Ambrose told me when my Breasts were bigger and -- Give you
good Den, and thank you forsooth


Fare you well, poor Simplicity, this young Landlord will ruin her* But who
comes here? Ah Mr. Hartwell


I met a pretty young Country Lass going out.


You see I have to do with all sorts. But where have you been that I have not seen
you all this while


In the Country; where betwixt Love and Jealousy, I have been almost
distracted; I have been as Unfortunate as you foretold


What Is the Matter?


The young Widow that I told you I courted, after all her assurances of
Kindness to me, was persuaded at last to admit other Pretenders, I sighed and
^ade my Complaints, but she insulted the more. --


Why did you not come to me to know what to do?


At last I was persuaded by a Relation of hers, who stands up for my ^nt'rest
to see what effects my Absence would work on her: In order to it, I ^ook a
solemn leave, told her that I removed my self from her sight, that my
Complaints might no longer be troublesome to her


That sudden Resolution startled her.


No, she was stout, and never so much as asked me to stay, I have been this Month
at Tunbridge, I came to Town but last Night, and my Friend tells me, that
several of her Acquaintance that came thence informed her I made Love to a
certain Lady there, for whom she has no kindness, at which s^e was much
surpised, and is grown jealous


That Is a good sign.


My Friend took the hint, and persuaded her, that her unkindness and slights,
had forced me to this remedy, to put her out of my thoughts; at which she is so
piqu'd, that she has but this morning resolved to come sometime to day to know
of you how I stand affected


Let her come, Does she know you are in Town?


No, nor shall not till I see how her inclinations are to me. It lies in your
power to do me a particular kindness, by assuring her I am the truest,
faithful'st, constant Lover


I warrant you.


But let me tell you, she has no great opinion of Persons of your Profession,
and you will not very easily bring her to believe what you say, unless you can
do'^ by some extraordinary means


Because I have many Businesses in hand that requires have, and lest she should
come before my Art can be prepared for her reception, I will do it by a Trick
that will very much surprise her, and be extreme pleasant


Do so, if you are sure it will not fail.


I warrant you. Ho Beatrice, call Mrs. Francis to me presently.


Here she is, we were talking together at the Stairs head.


Come near, Mrs. Francis, I have a word to whisper in your ear.


I Will about it presently. --


Hark you once more --


I Will be sure to take care.


Do every thing just as before, and let Decoy be in readiness near hand.
Beatrice let it be your care to see 'em enter in due order


Yes.


Now that you may not take any body else for my pretty Widow, I Will show you
her Picture in a Minature, Take good notice of it, it is very like her


You have reason to love her, she is a great Beauty, a delicate Brown.


Hear me Dame, If you would have her credit you, I fear she will require good
proofs of your Skill, for her Kinsman tells me, that she comes at the
persuasion of a Countess, where she was a Visiting not an hour since, who has
assured her, that she can ask you nothing, that you cannot satisfy her in


She absolutely believes you are not in Town.


She sent a Lady of her Acquaintance a Letter at Tunbridge an inquisitive*
Letter about new Amors, and but yesterday received an Answer; I happened to be
of that parties particular Acquaintance, unknown to her, and prevailed with her
at parting to write her word of my continuance there, that she might not know
any thing of my coming away; So that she does not in the least*suspect I am so
near


Since it is so, I Will prompt her curiosity to see you. There Is a Looking-glass I
prepared for another Business, it shall now serve for this; when your Mistress
is here, and you hear me make a sort of Invocation, steal softly forth behind
her, as she is looking in the Glass, and be kissing her Picture, and this she
will take for a great proof of your Love and Constancy


I understand you.


After a Minute retreat, and if I demand any thing else (which you will guess
by my words) come forth and perform it


She has no belief of Spirits at all, and has a great presence of Mind;
therefore have a care how you proceed


Rely upon me. I Will not be mistaken I Will warrant you.


There Is a very pretty Lady --

Desires to speak with you.


If it should be her now.


Of what Complexion is she?


A lovely Brown.


Get you gone quickly, and be sure to listen to our Discourse, and remember
about the Looking-glass. -- Now bring her in, and be you near me, I Will give you
the sign when you shall send Mrs. Francis in. That is a piece of management to
amuze both the Lady and the Gallant that is absconded, that he may not think
all I do is Legerdemain. This must be his Widow, she is so very like the
Picture. Now let me see if this incredulous Lady cannot be wrought upon by my
Practice. You are welcome, Lady


I Am come to you at last, you are in Vogue, and it is now grown a fashion to
visit you on all occasions; and I cannot but follow the Mode as others do


My Knowledge is so very scant Madam, that perhaps you will think your coming not
worth the trouble


Even in deceiving your knowledge is much; Because you know how to deceive
persons of good discretion and parts


To do that, would cost me more trouble than to tell the truth.


See what you can tell me, here is my hand.


There Is not a Line but denotes you a very fortunate Lady, born under a Planet
of Benign influence, and good luck will attend you


Pass by what is so general.


You are a Widow. The grief for the Death of your first Husband is almost worn
from your Heart, by the hopes of a Second; You have many Pretenders: But
there is one loves you above the rest in a high degree, and he is very jealous,
impatient if you but look upon another man, and quarrelsom with you, if access
of Passion may be called so


There is something in that --


He has been absent some time, and you have treated him so ill, that now he is
from you, you are apprehensive lest you should lose him


It may be so.


But fear nothing, he has an Inclination to no person but your self, and if you
Marry him you will be the happiest Woman in a Husband of all your Sex


This is no very ill beginning; but let me freely tell you, that I am one of
small faith, and if you would have me believe you to be a Woman of such
Knowledge as you pretend to, you must tell me something more remarkable than
you do to others


There Is a Gentlewoman without brought to you in a Chair. She says she is come
a great way to speak with you


Cannot you tell who she is? run and desire her to come again an hour hence, I am
not at leisure to speak with any body now


If you did but see her, you would have Compassion for her, she is in such a sad
Condition, and so full of Pain that I have not the heart to send her away. Be
pleased to see her Dame, I never saw the like in all my life


She may need your speedy help. Hark yonder how she shrieks; I Will have patience
awhile


I am very sorry I should make you wait. Call her in.


MAdam, your Reputation is so great, and your Doings so wonderful, that I am
come to desire you --


You're under a mistake, Madam. I am not the Person you mean.


Pardon my Error, I am in such pain, and so afflicted with what I undergo, that
--


You are vastly swelled indeed, your Tympany is very extraordinary.


Eh, hi, hi, oh --


Alas, good Gentlewoman.


Pray do what you can for me, I am informed that you not only can tell by
Astrology things past, present, and to come; but that also you have Charms to
cure all Diseases, not cureable by the Physicians, and Countercharms for
Witchcrafts and the like


I am acquainted with some such Secrets, but yours is a very strange Distemper.


I don't ask you to make an absolute cure at present, but only to assuage the
pain, and give me a little ease


You ought not to refuse her that Kindness.


Tell me true, Do you not think it above my Skill.


I Will believe you an able Woman indeed, if you can do this.


It is Charity to ease the afflicted, and it concerns my reputation to comply
with you


Then you will Cure this Tympany.


In your presence, your Ladyship shall see it done, before the Gentlewoman goes
hence, she shall not have the least pain, swelling, or appearance of any such
thing


You promise largely.


Good Madam. --


Dame if you please Call me Dame.


Good Dame then, don't promise any thing you are not sure to perform; I have
been thus above these three years, and I shall be content to be cured in three
months. The Doctors, Apothecaries, and Chyrurgeons have tried their Skill to no
purpose. Some say it is Witchcraft, and that I am under an ill Tongue


I Will let you see that I know more than all of 'em. But you must find out
somebody so Charitable as to be willing to take your swelling on them, for as
it came by Witchcraft, so I cannot transmit it from your Body but to another,
be it Man or Woman, as you please, that matters not


I see your Evasion, because no body will be willing to be tortured, you hope
to come off and save your Credit


It Is apparent enough you don't know how to cure me, therefore never go about to
keep me in suspense


I intend no such thing, do but you find out a Person, and I Will cure your
^ympany


Where should I find out one, if your Servant there would be willing (...) do
me that Kindness, I Would reward her well for it


I Madam, I would not have it for all you are worth; what would the World say
of a young Woman as I am? If I should be seen with such a great ^elly, they
would not believe I came by it in that manner


Your Servant is well versed in your Business, she has her lesson, and would
bring your Skill into Reputation by seeming afraid of your Charm, and by that
would make us believe you can do it


You mistake Madam; No body here has any such designs.


I would gladly see this Experiment. -- Can you think of nobody that will do
you such a courtesy? there are enough to be found for Money


I will endeavor, but that requires time. Now I think on it, a Tenant's Man of
mine is below, that I got to come up to Town with me, perhaps he will do so much
for me


Quickly call him up.


Yes, Madam. --


If the Fellow be willing, I ask but a half quarter of an hour, the Gentlewoman
shall be eased of the Tympany


I Will believe it Dame, when I see it.


Upon that point rest my Credit with you.


HArk you honest William --


I thank you with all my heart Londlody, for your good will to me, the
Gentlewoman here has told me the Business. I have no mind to have a Tympany.
There Is a Belly with all my heart; why all the folk would call me Bursengut; no
I thank you


But hear what I say, if you will do it for me I Will give thee Twenty Pieces, and
be bound to maintain you all your life, without doing any manner of work, and
here is Ten of 'em in hand


Hark you friend, don't be such a Fool to refuse 'em. Are you so simple to
think this Woman can remove the Tympany from her to you, it is impossible


So I think to tell you true forsooth; Well, well, give 'em me, I Will venture.


It shall depart from her, but scarce be perceivable in you; Come sit you down
here. --


I begin to tremble.


This goes on, and I begin not to know what to think on it.


Let no body speak a word.


Ah, ah.


Ah, ah.


Eh, good Dame Eh.


Ah, ah, ah, What a rumbling and grumbling I feel in my Gu^* Oh it is coming,
it is coming


Ah, ah, ah, the Tympany is going, it is going, Eh, eh, eh, I feel it, I feel
it. It Is going, going, going; Ah ah


Ah, it Comes, it Comes, it Comes; ah, it Comes, it Comes, it Comes --


Ah my swelling, ah my swelling, Eh, eh, eh.


Oh I burst, I burst, oh I burst; O-la, O-la, la, la, la, Ah, ah, ah, it is
enough, enough, enough. -- Eh, I am half as big again as my Landlady was; Oh, oh
my Belly is as big as a Tun


Ah, how much at ease I am now!

Ah you are a most rare Woman --


Well, what say you now Madam?


My wonder is above expression.


Methinks I am not the same person, may I credit my senses, I feel not the
least pain, I am well and lightsom, I am overjoyed. Ah good Dame here are
Thirty Guinneys, but that is not sufficient, let me present you with this Ring,
and hope yet a better reward than all this. Adieu Madam, your most humble
Servant, I am impatient till I go and show my self to my Friends and
Acquaintance, I fancy none of 'em will know me, William come follow me, good
William


Nay, marry I am in no such have, you are lighter than you were, and I am so
much the heavier, I shall be finely laughed at for my pains, here is a Cure with
a Poxt to it. Wounds, I can hardly see my way for my Belly


How you waddle along, you are as slow paced as a Snail.


Marry none but such a Calf as I would have been blown up thus like a Scotch
Bagpipe


Farewell Friend.


SUre I have a mist before my Eyes.


Your Ladyship has seen a small Essay of my Skill.


I am quite astonished; since you can do such, feats as these, don't seen me
away barely with words; but let me see something in relation to my Lover


Explain your self, have you a Curiosity to see what he is a doing at this
instant


Ay, that if you please.


Would you see him by your self, if you will I Will pronounce but two word^, and
retire, and his likeness shall appear to you in his posture, and doing the same
actions that he is employed about at this instant, where e're he is


And shall I see nobody but him?


That is according as he is alone, or in Company.


Let me see him then, but be you here, not that I am afraid; perhaps (...) very
well pleased where he is, and troubles not his thoughts about me


You Spirits that are Subject to my Charms, Obey, Obey, Obey, And let there to
this Ladies eyes appear the form of him she loves. Beatrice, draw that Curtain,
he will stay but a moment


It Is he, my Lover himself!

What is he a doing?


His eyes are fixed upon a Picture.


It Is my Picture, I know it by the Ribbond.


I hope you are well pleased now, he kisses it with a great deal of Devotion.


I am surpised, but now he is gone; my Satisfaction of seeing him was but very
short


There Is not a more faithful Lover in the World, nor one that has so great a
Passion for your Ladyship


Having seen what I did, I need no longer doubt it; now I wish with all my
heart he were in Town


I could do your Ladyship such a Kindness if you would but write to him.


Nay, I believe he would come with Writing, but I cannot send my Letter till to
Morrow; And 'twill be two or three days before he can be here


But I have a nimbler Post of my own, write but to him to come away presently,
and I Will send an Express with it that shall bring you an Answer in half a
quarter of an hour, and he shall be here himself to Night


Bless me sweet Heaven! what do you mean?


Nay, I say it, if your Ladyship be so minded. --


How! Shall I have an Answer of my Letter presently.


As soon as it can be writ.


It Is thirty Miles to Tunbridge, where he is.


If it were a hundred, my Messenger would be there and back again n a moment.


This is more than I ever heard of you yet. -- The like sure was ^ever done.


Step to the Table, there is Pen, Ink, and Paper; Now please to write what I
dictate

Sir, I can no longer endure your absence; Send me word by the Bearer if you
resolve to put an end to my Trouble, by letting me see you in Town to Night?
That Is enough, Subscribe as you please -- Now give it me to S^l, a little
Ceremony is required which you cannot see without being extremely frighted;
I Will wait on you again in a minute. -- --


I have been Courageous hitherto, but now I begin to have an ugly apprehension.


Madam, you need not fear any thing.


How do you do to live with her, and not be frighted.


O Madam, I am used to it.


But was not you horribly scared at first?


Alas, Madam, my Dame took me in Fatherless and Motherless; I was left quite
friendless, and was glad to be any where. But now I am used to it, it is nothing
to me


Whither is she gone now?


To her Familiar.


What is it like?


It Is a sort of Hobgoblin which she has above, it is hellishly ugly; but never
does any mischief


I protest I am confounded at all she does.


She is a Prodigious Woman, and if you should but know all.


Your Letter is there by this time.


What already?


Go to the Glass and see --

Spirit by all the Power I have over thee, Obey, obey, obey; And let the same
Person again be visible


He comes again, he is Reading my Letter, he seems transported with Joy.


It Is a great Confirmation of his Passion.


Now he takes a Pen in his Hand.


He Is going to write to you* and that very minute he gives the Messenger the
Answer, he will quit that Fantastical Body he appeared in, and bring it here to
you


To me, let him not come near me, I entreat you.


Be in good cheer, it shall fly to your feet without being seen who brings it,
or whence it comes


Now they bring him a Candle. -- He Is going to seal it, I am all over in a cold
sweat


Methinks every thing is done very gently. See now he is gone to deliver it to
my Messenger, I took particular care you should not be frighted


It Is true, though I am not naturally timorous, yet I have seen so many things,
that I did not believe possible to be done; that I confess to you I am scarce
in my right Senses


But pray oblige me to say nothing of all this. But see my Messenger has made
have, here is an Answer come --

Here Madam, take it, be not afraid.


How, touch a thing that came by the Devil!


Read it, the force of my Conjuration is spent, and my Spirit's Commission is
now at an end, you need not fear any further effects


It Is his Handwriting, who could have believed this possible?

Dear Charming Creature -- I shall take Post immediately, and doubt much
whether you will see me, or the Messenger first. A Lover when summoned by the
Person he adores, rides commonly the forehorse, Yours

I must take my leave without Ceremony. -- I am in a manner struck Dumb with
^dmiration, I Will see you again very suddenly, though I make you no
acknowledgment for the present trouble, your favors shall not go unrewarded


As you please, I only require your secrecy; Beatrice wait on her ^wn, and
shut the door

^ome forth, Sir.

Well Sir, how is it with you? Have I done you good Service?


I am so obliged to you, I shall never be able to come out of your Debt.


This Slight showed as well as if I had showed the deepest mystery in my Art,
That would have taken up time, and your occasions required expedition


This was as well -- Here are Ten Pieces, let that excuse me till a further
opportunity to express my Gratitude


Get on your Boots and Riding garb, to appear in to her at Night, I have
performed my part, the rest depends on your management


I Will go and prepare for it. Adieu.


DAme Dobson -- Ha my Dear Devil of a Dame, Do you know me again Dame!


Who are you: What Mr. Gillet?


How do you like me Dame? Am not I Heroically equip't? don't I look like a
Bully of the Field


You are one already for certain.


View me round, have I not the right air and mien of a Warrior?


As if you had been in twenty Champaigns, and fifty Assaults, besides Attaques
and Sieges


Would I were amongst 'em. Mortblue the Habit makes the Soldier, it puts life
and courage into me; methinks I am inspired with valor, I could beat the Devil
now; I Will Pawn my Soul to Old Nick but I Will be the Death of a Hundred men e're
long


You must not be too fierce on the sudden.


I cannot forbear, if I should be hanged, I went e'n now to show my self to my
Mistress, where I met three or four of my Rivals, the young Officers I gave you
an account of; and they at their old rate began to jeer, and told me I was a
Coxcomb, for putting my self into such a Garb; I presently whipped out Poaker,
placed my Thumb as you gave me directions, firm, Close said I, They star'd upon
me, and ^eigning to laugh, retreated, and but one of 'em du^st so (...) as draw
his Sword


I believe it, they found themselves mistaken in you.


It Is a rare Sword Dame, with this and my Thumb thus, I defy a whole Squadron.


You have it right, but let me advise you to moderate your Courage, and never
to use it: But upon just provocation, and in your own defense


I shall have much ado to govern my self, let them look to it that (...) voke
me, -- Ha, Stand off -- ha


Hold, put up, Somebody is coming.


At their Peril be it if they anger me. --


TWo words with you Dame, about a thing I had forgot to speak to you of.


I Will take care.


If I should come to be known, it would spoil all.


It would prejudice my reputation as much as your interest; therefore look you
be secret your self


Nay, it shall never be known for me.


Then you need say no more.


But if any of your Servants? --


Why are you importunate, when she tells you, You need say no more.


What Is that to you Sir, Do you think I don't know my own business?


And do you think my Dame Dobson don't know a little better than you? She tells
you, you need say no more, and it is an affront to her Art not to believe her;
and I Will not see my Dame affronted


Eh, Mr. Gillet.


No, No quarter, I Will Hamstring him.


Ha! Is the fool so brisk? have at you then.


Whoh, you push too hard -- Hold a little; Pish, the Devil's in you; See there
now my Sword's down


He that can defend his life no better, should not be so insolent and
impertinent


Pough Dame, never be dismayed, this was some mistake in my Thumb -- it was not
put right


Sir, Pray use your Conquests with moderation.


It Is well for him that he is in your House, had he been any where else, I Would
have used the fool as he deserved; but I Will not occasion any disturbance here.
There Is his Sword


Your discretion obliges me. -- You don't understand your self, Mr. Gillet, I
gave you warning before


Dame, you must teach me once more how to place my Thumb right, I was mistaken
-- but for the future


No, that is not the Business -- your Thumb was right enough.


What then?


Did you not see me make signs to you to retreat? 'twas nothing for him to get
the better of you


Why so?


Because he had a Sword of me with a Charm too, he has had i^ this (...)
Months, and the eldest Charm still Conquers the other


Oh! I wondered indeed where the fault lay, The Devil on it how he (...) his
Along, and clatter'd his Sword about mine, his is a damnable strong ^m


You see you are not to fight with every one at a venture.


Well, now you have given me warning, I Will be sure to ask that first.


You Will do well; for if your Enemy has an Enchanted Sword too, yours will
signify nothing unless it be elder


I Will go now and fight the rest of my Rivals from my Mistress, and if she will not
Marry me then, I Will be gone for Tangier, where I Will kill my Fifty Moors aday
for my diversion till they are all destroyed, and then I Will return the great
Hero of Great Britain, and be made a General. Adieu Dame


The man will go mad for certain. At last I am got clear of Visiters, I must
make use of this opportunity for other Affairs. --


What News bring you, Mrs. Prudence? How does your Lady?


She Is below, she made me light out of the Coach at Door to come and know if
you were alone, and at leisure to be spoke with


Beatrice, run down and tell the Lady that is below in the Coach, I am alone,
and if she pleases, may come in


You see how impatient she is to know your Answer to her Question.


She has reason for it, but you know it required time to deceive her
Artificially: It was necessary to our purpose to make her put away her former
Woman, and to take you in her place, and to continue it without letting her
know that you were of our Acquaintance; It was requisite also to let her be
^ccustomed to you, that she might put Confidence in you. All this is brought
about, and we are now upon the point to Compass our design without danger of
ever having our Confederacy discovered


It shall never be known for me.


I am assured of your Secrecy upon account of your Cozen, whose intrest is not
a little concerned in mine, Decoy has done me an excellent piece of Service by
engaging you to our party; I am glad he had a Kinswoman so discreet and capable
to serve us in this affair, it shall be to your Satisfaction


I Will play my part so exactly, that my Lady shall believe all the Devils in
Hell had a hand in it


Well, and how Dame, have you been mindful of me?


You desired by some supernatural means to be convinced of the thin^ you had a
mind to know


Yes, because I would have no doubt for the future.


You would know whether your Husband will dye before you? Now mind what I say,
In the Alcove of your Chamber stands a high Cabinet, upon which is a great deal
of Purcellein and China. The great Jarr or Urn that stands in the middle, shall
fall down of it self at some time of the Night, if it breaks your Husband shall
dye first; if it does not break, you will go before him. -- Now I tell you, it
will be his turn to dye first, and you will live long after him; But I do this to
satisfy you fully in the point, is not this as supernatural a thing as can be?
and by this you will see that I am not a person of words, and outward show
only; for this shall happen at home at your own House, where I nor nobody for
me can be to use any means or device to throw it down; But what, you look a
little blank upon the matter


It Is true, I begin to apprehend that I have engaged my self too far, and my
heart fails me


For my part, Madam, I shall certainly be afraid; and if your Ladyship please,
you may dispense with my not lying there


No, never talk on it, that must not be.

That silly Wench is afraid of every thing, but I am resolved to know my
Fortune in this point, and if that happens which you say, be assured I will
largely consider your extraordinary pains


I never doubted your Ladyships bounty, if your Ladyship pleases to follow me,
I Will give you a little Viol to drink three Spoonfuls of, which when you go to
Bed will make you slumber, and prevent your fear


MRs. Beatrice, tell your Dame she shall hear from me to Morrow morning, I Will
come and acquaint her what passes


What is your Ladyship here?


You see how my Impatience to oblige you, has made me lay aside all scruples. I
had ever an aversion to the whole Tribe of Fortune Tellers, Astrologers, and
Cunning People, I always believed it their Business to get Money; but you
desired me to see this Dame Dobson


You have obliged me in it.


But who imagined to meet you here, she took me in to show me her Closet,
otherwise I had been gone and mist seeing you


What thinks your Ladyship of our Cunning Woman.


I Recant my former opinion, I resolved to assist you in convincing the World
that she was but a Cheat: But after what she has told me ought to be si^* she
has revealed such things, that it is impossible but she must deal with the Devil


There it is now, she is too cunning for all you Women, in that consists her
greatest Skill


Colonel, your Countess is a person highly deserving, and I shou*d be very
glad to see her Married to a Man of so much Worth and Bravery, and you know I
have hither to blamed her for desisting upon account of any thing this Woman
had foretold. But now I find the Countess was much in the right for I am
absolutely persuaded the Match will be very unfortunate


Such Predictions should not hinder if the Countess would but consent to Marry
me


But is there no other Woman in the World you could be content with for a Wife?
--


I have too strong a Passion ever to leave her.


But you must dispense with things when there are such strong Reasons against
you, endeavor to please your fancy in some other Beauty


What will it avail me to love any other? for in her opinion the Change of the
Person does not in the least alter the fate of my Marriage


I Confess she has much puzzled me too, she told me I should very suddenly be a
Widow, but that is no wonderful thing, for my Husband is very old and sickly;
and though his Death would be a great grief to me, yet there is some reason
for it: For according to the course of Nature, I should outlive him. But that
which I don't understand is this, she assures me I will Marry again, now I don't
find in my self the least inclination to a second Husband --


By that, you see there is no Credit to be given to what she says; for if you
never marry again, what becomes of her Prediction


Yes, but she maintains that I will, and that what she tells me will certainly
happen. She assures me moreover, that I shall make him I marry the happiest man
living


I verily believe it Madam, for a man cannot but be happy with a Lady of such
Beauty and Perfections. But for all this, Dame Dobson may be no great Conjurer;
for I Will tell your Ladyship, Suppose you had inclination enough to marry me, I
should have all the happiness imaginable with you, because that it is the
effect and influence of your Stars, and yet the Consequences of my Planet is,
for me to be jealous, vexatious, and tormenting of my Wife, to kill a man in
her presence, and to dye for it. How can these things hang together


But it is not certain that I shall marry you.


I only say, suppose it, Madam.


You know I never declared my mind in that point.


True Madam, nor do I now press you to it. But what I was saying is this, That
that which we know never will happen, yet might have happened


Eh.


And in this case after what this Dame of ours has told to me and the other,
she must in necessity be in the wrong either to you or me


But the fatality which she found threatened you, was perhaps to (...) but a
certain time, and not pointing to your whole life: It may be she did (...) look
so far, and if it were so, you may live a year or two unmarried, and after that
marry whom you please without danger


I assure your Ladyship, I apprehend no danger at all, she is a very lying
silly prating Woman


Your Servant Colonel, There Is a Lady that would not be known, and I am as
unwilling to be seen as she. For the World knowing that I have an old Husband,
and one that is Sick too, will be apt to report I came to inquire after his
Death


The World is very malicious. It Is therefore good to avoid Censure. Your
Ladyships most humble Servant


I Have made you expect a little too long.


Our Dame has some Persons above with her, and we cannot speak to her yet,
therefore you are come soon enough. But I beseech your Honor to tell me what
said the Lady to you that came in as you were Dressing? I perceived by her she
had some extraordinary News to tell you; and therefore I took my leave and came
before


She told me the same thing as somebody had acquainted you with before,
concerning the Adventure of a Looking-glass, and the Gentlewoman Cured of the
Tympany, I heard what a strict Charge you gave 'em, not to let me know anything
of those Matters


It will call any bodies reason in question to believe it, every body you see
tells you great Miracles of this Woman, and I meet not with one but she has
fooled and cozned


You are her Enemy, and will believe nothing; for my part I know her by
Experience, and believe all she has foretold relating to my self, to be as true
as if it were already happened


But permit I may reason the case a little, That that she foretells shall
happen to me, will not happen; but by the malign Influence of the Planets that
ruled at the time of my Nativity; now a thousand and a thousand others were
born at the same instant, and under the same Planet; and I shall all these if
they Marry be Unfortunate, Jealous, and Kill a^ Man* A^surd, absurd


You take it in a wrong sense, there is a fatality of good and evil fortune
affixed to each particular person. And this fatality does not depend upon the
moments of their Birth. A Thousand people perish together in a Ship^; a
Thousand others are killed in a Fight, they are all born at different times,
and (...) several Planets. Yet that does not hinder, but that the same
Misfortune (...) fall every one of them


I see you will never want Arguments to defend your Incomparable (...). If you
loved me. --


My Compliance to come hither again with you, is a sufficient testimony of my
Kindness. -- But now I will put on my Mask, and speak my North-Country t^ne,
lest Dame Dobson should come on a sudden, and surprise me, If we deceive her
in this, I will yield my self in the wrong, accept your Love, comply with your
desires of Marriage. But I am too well assured she will discover the Cheat


I doubt it very much; at least she will not remember to have seen me in the
disguise of a Footman


She hardly then so much as cast her Eye toward you, and this Habit, and that
Perriwigg gives you quite another air, you are in a manner another person


Here Is a Person of worth has waited with a great deal of Patience.


Have a care she does not get a glimpse of your Face. We are come to you with
an absolute belief and confidence in your Knowledge; for we have heard such
wonders of --


Let that pass, and to your own affairs; What is it that you desire of me?


I am a Gentleman of a good Family, though of a mean Estate, the person you see
here is a considerable* Heiress in the North, I have stolen her away, and
married her without her Friends consent, her Father is averse, and we use all
the interest we can to pacify him, by the persuasion of Friends, but he will
hearken to no terms. Now our request is a little difficult, but you have done
many stranger things, we desire you to make a perfect reconciliation; for which
you shall have Two hundred Pound for your pains


It requires much trouble to effect.


Ne marry, it is no such great fault. Lou^ I tro every day does the (...) of
that, and you shall no gang without a ge^d reward, if you can do us that (...)
(...) turn, and a thousand Benisons on you tol boot


What you desire is not impossible.


Here are 20 Guinneys for you in hand, take 'em and use the best of your Skill.


Eh, Weladay, Ise given you ten times as mough, set me but to rights with my
Father, I pray


I know the least Secret of your Art will be sufficient to do our (...) siness.


Well, I Will try what may be done; he lives in the North you say (...)


Yes, but he is hastening up to Town to look after us.


He shall be reconciled to you, but 'twill require some time.


Ene Geud betide you now in troath Dame.


I Will tell you now what you shall write to him.


Nea, Nea, the Deal of ill luck of that Woman, but he burns all I write to him,
and won not read 'em not so much as ean Letter; no he in troath Dame


When I have used a certain Ceremony to the Paper, and said some mystical words
over it, then write upon it, and provided, that he does but touch the Letter, he
shall have no Power to refuse, and then you shall see the Consequence


Ise warrant you he shall touch it, or it shall gang very hard.


That will be sufficient.


How glad am I at this, now you will be undeceived?


Geud, Geud blessing on thy heart for it. -- Ise pray for thee tol my dying day.
-- Ene give me the Paper quickly, Dame I am with barn till I gripe it in my
hand


I Will bring it to you in a Moment.


A word I beseech you before you go, we two married for Love; some are of
opinion that such matches are seldom fortunate, pray tell me what will be the
event of ours


You will be very happy, your


Nea, nea, Pray you tol excuse me there away, Ise ha money very* goad reasons
why I mun no show my face tol any ene in London; therefore pray you to hold you
content for this eance


Cannot you at the same time you set a spell upon the Paper, make also a
Discovery of what I ask to know beside


It shall be done, I Will be with you again presently.


Now Madam, I hope you will be as good as your word, Dame Dobson is no longer the
Person you took her for, where is her Skill and Cunning now? she believes we are
married, and I am no longer under the malicious influence of any Star to lose
my Head


We shall hear what she will say when she comes again.


She Will tell us we shall be very fortunate, and will bring you the Paper with a
Charm in it, or Charmed Paper; was ever any thing more ridiculous


I believe it would have the effect we desired, if what we ask t^ had been
real; but let us not rejoice too soon, when she has consulted her Spirits, I am
afraid she will find out the Cheat


But suppose she should bring you the Charmed Paper, without any Advertisement
from her Familiar of our Contrivance


Then I promise you to show my face, and canvince her of her Igno^, and to
Marry you without further scruple


Then I am a happy man, Dame Dobson is no more a Witch. I think I (...) her
coming


Now for the Paper, Dame.


What mean you here? This Lady has no Father, you have not stolen her away, nor
are you Married to her; and what is more, you never will be Married to her


Hear you that, I pray you geud Sir, were you told before that nea Witch in
the World had mear Skill


I confess I have not stole this Lady, nor am not yet Married to her. But say
you that I shall never Marry her


Never.


Your reason?


My Art tells me so; therefore --


But why, what shall hinder?


I stayed not to look into the reason, but it is an easy thing to let you know
why, if you are willing I shall call my Spirit, he shall tell you himself


Call him.


Eh wa is me, Call her Spirit.


That you may not be frighted at the Apparition, you shall see nothing but the
Head of a Dead person, which he shall animate, and a while give motion to, as
if it were living, and had all its senses. But do not show the least sign of
fear, for he is disturbed when he sees any body afraid of him, and when he has
cause to be angry, I have no longer Power to control him


Nea, but I mun be afraid of the Deil, I shall be soar afraid in gued faith
Woman, therefore Ise see no Deil


Why Madam? I Will be near you.


This is an ill time for you to act the Hero, you may be afraid as well as the
Lady, as stout as you think your self, the appearance of my Spirit will daunt
you


I Will venture that.


Nea, nea, Sir; Ise naught to do with Spirit, nea with Head, Ise know ean
enough already


I Will wait upon this Lady home, and come to you again Dame, in the int'rim
prepare your blackish Spells, and your most dreadful Apparitions, you shall see
I am a man that fears nothing


I shall expect you. It concerns me now to play my part well. He Is a man upon
the fret, he is disgusted with Art, and will never give over till I can
absolutely convince him that I deal with the Devil. -- Mrs. Hellen you may
enter now if you please


WHat say you now Dame, was not my coming very seasonable?


How come they to play us this trick? I did not observe the Colonel enough in
his Footman's habit to know him again


It was a sudden resolution, and must happen by the importunity of this
indefatigable Colonel. When I came home and heard she had changed her Clothes,
and that she was gone abroad in his Coach without any Attendants to meet him
somewhere it gave me a Suspicion, and I concluded their Rendezvous must be
here. -- Judge now of my diligence


It makes well for our Business that it fell out so.


I look upon the Marriage now to be quite broken off, the Countess after this
will never receive any more of his Visits. -- Adieu, I Will go out at the back
door, and slip home before they miss me; and for the future, I Will take care you
shall not be surpised


Do, for your diligence will be useful. Fare you well.


YOu are an able Practitioner, I am as well pleased at this act, as at the Cure
of the Tympany, in which I performed my part


But our most necessary business at present is this Colonel. He is gone hence
with the Countess much confounded in his understanding; He is resolved to come
again, and will always be troubling us unless by some Stratagem we can bring
him to an absolute belief, that I am a Woman of profound Science


That Is no hard thing, play him the same Prank that so affrighted the young
huffing Volontier that is gone for Tangier. He that braved it out, and thought
himself a man of such undaunted Courage


I believe 'twill shock the Colonel as much, I see Beatrice is Conducting us
some new Customer, go in and get all things in readiness for that design, for
the Colonel will not long be absent


IS this She?


That is Dame Dobson.


Though your Person is a Stranger to me, your Reputation is not; therefore I
hope you will excuse one that --


My Name is sufficiently known, therefore no Apologies, but to the Business;
what is your pleasure


I am informed you not only concern your self in telling Fortunes, but that you
have wonderful Secrets to preserve Beauty, as also to give it where it is
wanting; Don't look upon me I beseech you: This Discourse has brought a color
into my Face as red as Scarlet


How! Come to know your Fortune, and debar me from looking in your face?


Nay, if you must -- but -- I vow to you I am so ashamed.


How ashamed and have such a pretty Face as that, a most lovely delicate Face!
--


Nay, I am sensible I am not a perfect Beauty, but my comfort is, that as I am
not absolutely handsome, I am not very ugly; I know I have something in me
taking enough, a lively air, not altogether ungentile, indifferently well
shaped, no ill mien, and some share of wit too; and with all this, I can make
no very ill figure in the World


Your appearance is very extraordinary.


In truth I am content to be as I am, and I would not change with a great many
that are thought very considerable Beauties


Change, -- It must be for the worse, I know never a Lady in Town but would be
proud to be like you


I do not come to you to be made more Beautiful than I am, but to have
something that may preserve what is already agreeable in me, and to keep me a
great while in my prime


But what if I should give you some additional Beauty?


But can you? --


I have experienced the Secret a hundred times, it is but to change your Skin
for you. --


Change my Skin!


Yes Madam, change your Skin.


Change my Skin? good Gods, change my Skin, I shrink at the very thoughts on it,
and I begin to fancy already that you are fleaing me alive. --


That would be a Cruelty indeed; but in short Lady, if you would have a fine
delicate soft supple Skin like an Infant, you must do as I tell you


It Is enough for them that are ugly to suffer all that. But as for me that have
only a few Pock-holes to endure so much --


But who says it will be any pain to you?


Why, dear Dame, is it possible to make me handsomer, and not endure pain?


The only inconvenience is, that you must keep your Chamber fifteen days, and
not be seen, you will not be the only person, I have four or five Patients at
this time that keep within for this very reason


Fifteen days is no such long time.


I Will give you a Pomatum that shall insensibly take off the first Skin of your
Face, without giving you the least trouble, or any wish imaginable


O let me have it quickly, I Will give you any rate.


My Pomatum is not yet quite ready, three or four days hence I (...) be able to
pleasure you


And will not this Pomatum lessen the Mouth, and take it off a little at the
corners? for methinks a little Mouth is the becoming'st thing, the Mouth can
never be too little, too little


I have a contracting Water that does that. But my Pomatum will make the under
Lip a little more pouting and ruddy, Oval the Eyes, and give a just proportion
to the Nose


You are a most delicious ravishing Woman for this: Now if I might ask you one
little thing more


I Will do any thing for you that lies in my Power.


You know Dame that the handsomer any person is, the more ambitious and
desirous to be entirely perfect; I pretend a little to Singing, I have all the
New Airs in Town, and can sing all the Songs that are now in Season, I would
desire you to mellow my Voice, and take away a little harshness, that I may
have it more at command, and bring it within compass. There are certain little
Softnesses and Rowlings in the Voice, which are extreme pretty and sweet, which
I have not yet to my fancy


If you will go to the Charge on it Madam, I Will make you sing like a Cherubin; I
make an admirable Syrrup for that purpose, the Composition is a little dear,
you shall not use it above three Months, but --


Make, make it, I Will not spare for Cost.


It shall be ready with the Pomatum, I Will only take Measure of your Voice. --


Take measure of my Voice, how is that?


That is, you must let me hear you sing a little, that according to the
Strength and Sweetness of your Voice, I may add or diminish in the Composition
of the Syrrup


I have a little hoarsness at present.


No matter, when once I have heard you, I shall guess how it is.


This was not altogether well Sung, but --


You have already a very good manner of Singing, but the Syrrup I will make for
you


I entreat the favor of you to let me partake of all your Secrets, I have
reason to endeavor for the greatest Accomplishments and Perfections that I
can, since my dependence is chiefly on them; -- For though I make this show as
you see in the World, yet I have but a mean Fortune; -- It Is true, I live well
at Court, and have good Relations and Friends that wish me well for my Families
sake; But all that will not do my Business; I must look for further Advancement


A Lady of your Perfections cannot but Command her Fortunes at Court, you have
so many Charms, and there are hearts so disposed to love. --


Do you think then I shall be successful in those Affairs?


If you overcome one Difficulty you will be a very happy Woman.


O fie, O fie, Dame now I am no longer able to look you in the face.


O Madam, I only said so to let you see I have some little Skill, Come tell me,
what Circumstances you are in, and how affairs stand as to that point


O you have spoke a word that has confounded me, and I see I had need tell you
nothing, you know it already


What is general I know at first sight; but if I would specify particulars, I
must have recourse to my Art, those things are not learnt but with pains and
difficulty, and time spent in study; -- wherefore if you expect any help from
me, tell me your grievance, that I may the sooner give you a further proof of
my Abilities


I can no more have Confidence to tell you then --


You should no more conceal any thing from me than from your Physician; believe
me Madam, I am an Excellent Midwife, and can give you a quick Deliverance from
most misfortune


O, O, O, what shall I do? what shall I do! never was the like of this!


What ails you Madam?


O Don't come near me, don't look at me, I shall dye with shame, well if it is
so plain to be discovered already, I Will go and hide my self from all the World


I suspect some thing, I Will follow the hint.


I see it is in vain for me to conceal any thing from you, but pray tell me
Dame, do you perceive it with your eye, or is this knowledge the effect of your
Skill! Methinks I don't look big at all


It Is so, She has swallowed the forbidden Morsel.

No, no, fear nothing, I confess ingeniously to you, I knew it by my Art only,
and that pierces through Stone Walls, and Mountains. Now give me a short
account of your Condition, and tell me what you would have me to do for you


This is an Age of a great freedom, but the Court you know is a place that more
particularly allows of a frank free Conversation, -- An eminent Person made
Courtship to me, at first I thought it but raillery, and that he did it out of
Gallantry only, but the Continuance in time made me sensible he was in earnest.
His person at first was not displeasing to me; but his Protestations, Vows and
Sighs, and his continual Observances begot a Passion in my heart, and at last
he won me to a kind Compliance, I scarce knew I loved before I was undone


He Will never Marry you.


O never! I see you have studied my Case thoroughly, you know every particular.
No, he is now upon his Marriage with a Lady of great Quality, all things are
agreed, they are to be married suddenly


Come, you must make the best on it.


O my shame is growing upon me; I shall be scorned by my Relations, my
Reputation gone, I am ruined: -- Therefore dear Dame Dobson help me in time, if
you know any thing that will cause an Abortion


No, no, my Art meddles not with Life or Death, that were Murder.


Then I must abandon all Society. -- Ple never stay where I am known* let me
see, I will go beyond Sea, and stay there till I am brought to Bed


Perchance we may save you that trouble.


And my honor be safe?


If I undertake it --

Let me consider a little, I Will consult my Art, and resolve you further.


Dame, here is the young City Hector, he is come to you in a great heat, I could
scarce keep him out till I came in to acquaint you he was there


There Is some mischief in this, he has been beaten again, and comes to upbraid
me

Carry this Lady into some far Room, that she may not hear our Discourse.
Madam, please to retire a little, my Servant shall wait on you; I must use a
Ceremony in order to your affair, that will require my being alone a moment or
two


I Would gladly expect as many hours.


This way, Madam.


Mr. Gillet where are you?


O I thought the time long, I could scarce have Patience, O Dame, I have been
served a damnable trick


As how my little Hero?


I went to visit my Mistress, resolving to sight away all my Rivals, and to
take her out, and be Married before I left her, and when I came, there was the
Devil to do, they were Singing, Dancing, and Feasting, as if they were all mad


What was the meaning of that?


The Jade had jilted me, and his Morning was married to a little damned
flattering young Officer, I had always a good mind to have Cut his Throat, and
if they had not prevented me. --


What would you have done?


I Would have spoll'd their Jollity. -- I bolted into the Room amongst them, swore
two or three bloody Oaths; but e're I could draw, three of them clapped ^old of
me, took away my enchanted Sword, and tumbled me down Stairs


If your Sword had been drawn they could not have don't.


Ay, there was my sillyness, I swore before I drew; But Dame, what (...) I do
for my Sword? I was fain to come away without it, for there were Constables
sent for, and such an Uproar of People at the Door


You did well to come away.


But my Sword.


If they don't send it you, you must have another; I have just one left.


But cannot you Conjure for it.


That will be the same Charge to you, and this that I have has something a
stronger Charm


Let the other go and be Hanged, then I Will have this. Here, here is Money for it,
let me have it quickly


Within there, fetch me down the Sword that hangs above. But why in such have
Son Gillet


Son!


Excuse the familiar Expression. But I call you Son, because I take a
particular Affection to you, and adopt you my Favorite, and will show the
utmost of my Skill to oblige you


Well then, Mother I thank you, I called for the Sword in have, because I have
but a short time to order my affairs; for I intend to leave England in three or
four days, and go for Tangier; where when my Name is famous, and I have been a
terror to the Heathen Pagans and Infidels, I will return the Champion of
Christendom, and then Mother, I will make you a brave Woman indeed


But Son, if you design all this, you omit a material Circumstance; since you
resolve to set up for a Champion, you must have a Mistress, in honor of whom
you must fight and wear her Colors, and ingrave her Name upon your Sword with
some remarkable Motto


You are in the right, I have read some such thing in Pyramus, and the Seven
Champions, and Valentine and Orson. But how shall I do, I have never a Mistress
now


You must choose another before you go.


I love never a Woman in the World, but she that is Married this Morning.


No, it must be a single Woman; Let me see your hand, I Will tell you how long
'twill be before you will be in love


Stay, let me clean it a little, it is something dirty with my fall down Stairs.
There now --


Hum, Um, Mount Venus -- Um -- Um -- Not in love Sir.


No!


No!


No I vow to Gad.


Why, you are just upon your Marriage as it 'twere.


Gad then it is as 'twere not; for I know nothing often.


Pull off your Hat, let me see your Forehead; I was sure I was not mistaken.


It may be you see something that relates to what is past betwixt me and my
Mistress that is Married; for I thought it as good as a Match, only her Friends
fell off, because I was but a Citizen, and not of a Family good enough for her


No Son, Nothing of all this, both in your hand and forehead I see the
infallible signs of a Marriage; and if you are not Married to a handsome young
Lady of a vast Fortune within Eight and forty hours, I Will never pre^d more to
Astrology


In Eight and forty hours!


Ay.


And to a great Fortune!


An Heiress, and of a great Family. -- There Is something of honor too joined
with this Marriage -- You Will be a Knight or a Lord very suddenly


And all this by a Wife, where or how shall I see this Woman?


I could Conjure for her, and let you see her likeness. But what need you care
for that, since 'twill infallibly be so, though I have not examined yet by what
chance it will come about


O dear Dame, Sweet Mother, Do but Conjure for her, and let me know all; Do,
and I Will hugg you, as the saying is, as the Devil hugged the Witch


My adopted Child, I have promised to deny thee nothing; Go into the next Room,
lay by your Hat and Sword, when my Invocation is over, and the Spirit that
assumes her likeness ready, I will blow this little Whistle. Then come forth,
pass by, kiss your hand, and bow in token of good Will and Amity; for you must
reverence the Spirit just as you would do the Party her self, were she there


I must not speak then.


Not a word, all dumb signs -- and no more than I tell you, when you are passed
then go into that Room there, and stay till I call you


I Will observe your Orders to a hair.


Go then and prepare.

Hem Beatrice! Now Fortune assist me, and this will be a gainful business.


Come Madam, I have good News for you, I find by my Art that it will be for
your turn to marry suddenly, your Husband will be Rich, a little Capricious,
but one that will love you, and with whom you may live very happily, if you can
excuse the want of Noble Parentage


If he be rich, and can maintain me handsomely.


So far I proceeded, and since your Condition may excuse all other defects, I
left off the enquiry of unnecessary particulars, and went forward to give you a
view of the Person that is to be your Husband


As how!


To show you his likeness, it is true, it is done by my Invocation of a Spirit;
but you will see nothing but the likeness of a Man pass by you


O Lord, I fancy I feel the ground open under me.


No, the rising of him is a little terrible; therefore not to ^right a Woman in
your Condition, I have ordered it that you shall be in the next Room ^ere, and
when you hear a Whistle, enter, and at the same time the likeness of your
Husband shall enter at that Door, and if it bows to you, return his Civility,
and go out there, and stay till I call you


But shall I be safe?


In the next Room hangs a little gilt Helmet, put that on, and take (...) Spear
that belongs to it in your hand; they have Power of Protection from (...) evil
Spirits. But you need not fear, go


My desire to see the Person, encourages me very much; I long to see what
manner of man it is I shall Marry


Go your ways -- So, now shall I have the diversion to see two Fools afraid of
one another. He by his folly, and she by her fondness will be enduc'd to an
absolute belief of my Conjuration; thus does my Art at once afford me Profit
and Pleasure. Mr. Gillet be ready. Madam be ready -- when --


Ha, ha, ha, Beatrice go after and keep her there till I Call; Son Gillet, Son,
Son


Ha!


Come, come in, the Apparition's gone.


I was a little afraid.


That was because you had not the Sword on: But the stoutest Men in the World
may be allowed to be afraid of a Spirit. Courage extends no farther than not
being afraid of living Creatures. But how did you like the Lady


O Dear Mother, a lovely Creature. But is she such a Fortune -- an Heiress?


I told you before as to that.


But where shall I see her now again in proper Person?


Go home immediately, and be standing most part of the day in your Father's
Shop, a Lady will come there in a Coach to buy some Jewels, amongst the rest
show her this Ring, desire her to put it o^ her Finger, if she does not offer
it her self when she is looking upon it; -- and if once this comes upon her
Finger, she falls immediately desperately in love with the man out of whose
hands it came last


O dear!


The Lady is not in love with you, or ever has seen you, but will accidentally
come as I tell you; Therefore I give you this Sympathy Ring, the very touch
whereof will beget in her such a strong passion, that she will not be able to
refuse you any thing that you will ask of her, nor endure to let you be out of
her sight, as long as the love Fit lasts


And how long will it last?


But two days. --


What if I should ask her to lie with her to be sure of her, for fear we should
not get to be Married in that time, and she afterward fall off


I told you you would infallibly be Married to her in Eight and forty hours;
therefore, I know nothing can fall out to the contrary; Besides to a^ her, that
would do no good, this is no Charm against virtue and honor, therefore you
must ask nothing but what is lawful


O ho, I understand you.


Go, get you home quickly, when she is come and has bought, proffer to wait on
her home for the Money, take with you a Wedding Ring to have in readiness, and
by the way make your Courtship, she will presently yield, then bid the Coach
drive to Marry La Boon, and by virtue of that Ring hoop her fast to you


Well, dear Mother, there is my Purse I leave in Pawn for this Ring, there is a
hundred Guinneys in it, and as soon as the Marriage is over, I Will come and give
you a hundred more to buy you a pair of Wedding Gloves. Adieu


There Is one Dispatch now for the Lady Bride. Here Beatrice, desire the Lady to
walk in


Go you down and guard the Door.

Madam, I have examined my Spirit, and I am informed that you will have a fancy
some time to day to go into the City to a great Jewellers to buy two or three
hundred pounds worth of Jewels, and from thence your Marriage will happen


How should I have such a fancy in my Head, I have not a quarter of the Money
by me to pay for 'em. And yet I have seen a man that your figure exactly
resembles, often standing in a Goldsmith's Shop as I have passed by in a Coach,
and have taken great notice of him


Do you know the Shop.


Exactly.


Go then, enquire the Peoples Names, and who this man is, and of what substance
and ability as to Riches; though I know by my Art he is or will suddenly be a
vast rich man. And when you are satisfied go in, pretend to buy a Diamond Ring,
bid him go home with you, and say you ll pay him the Money; though I know if
you take Five hundred pounds worth of Jewels he will present 'em you all, he is so
in love with you. And by the suddenness of your Marriage, I ghess he will offer
to marry you before you get half way home, and then he is paid of Course; and
the things are your own


I Will try the Frolic; If it be one as I suspect, I Will not make two words about
the Business


Go, and when you have done, come and inform me what passes.


But first Dame --


Nay, don't put your hand in your Pocket, I Will have no Reward till you are
satisfied I have deserved it, when the business is over. -- That you are
Married, and find your Husband as I tell you, if then you will present me with a
Jewel of One hundred pounds value, Ple esteem it for your sake, and such a
thing you may take up where you are a going


Well Dame, you are very generous, and so will I be in my Reward -- Till then
my thanks -- if this succeed, I shall be a happy Woman


And I shall have the Credit of making a good Match for a Court Lady that has
more Beauty than Honesty, is a fit Wife for a Citizen that has more Money than
Wit


MR. Gerrard, I see you are come to visit me again.


I am your Convert; finding my Pistols by your means, has given me an absolute
belief in every thing you say or do: Was there not a North-Country Lady with
you


Yes, a pretended Heiress. They thought to deceive me with a Story of her being
stolen away and Married


What could be more strange than the Discovery of that? 'Twas the Countess --
to whom the Colonel lays such a close Siege! She is absolutely resolved never
to have any farther Correspondence with him: And for proof often. I am to call
on her some time to Day to wait on her hither


What to do?


To desire a Charm of you to make her forget the Colonel.


I am at her Service.


But good Dame Dobson, now you have done me the favor so absolutely to
convince me of your profound Knowledge. I have one more favor to beg of you


What is that?


I am a man that love my Pleasure; I hate delays and laying Siege to Women: who
sometimes wanting a little Inclination to betray 'em within, will hold out
longer than fortified Towns. Now I am for a brisk assault, Taking, Sacking and
Plundering them all in a Minute: wherefore I would purchase a Secret of you,
that might make all Women that I have a mind to, to fall in love with me at
first sight


I understand you --


I am by Nature very inconstant, but do not think the worse of me for it, it is
the only way to be happy; for if we consider the thing right, what can be more
miserable than a constant Lover


Most men are of your mind.


Fully to enjoy the sweets of love, we must love all that are Fair and
Beautiful: The tall, the short, the lean, the plump, the fair, the black, the
brisk, airy, wild and the sober phlegmatic demure Lady: They have all some
different Charm, and something peculiarly pleasant and diverting in their way
of loving, which others have not; and therefore a Lover cannot be completely
happy that confines himself to any one, or indeed to less than all


You are one of an extraordinary Gusto.


I am experienced, and know Women: There is a sort of 'em that are proud,
haughty, and imperious, who think it a scorn that any man in the World should
say he has had the advantage of 'em. There are others of a cold Constitution by
Nature, and insensible: Some that nothing can change, when once they have
placed their Affections. And as this sort are very pleasant and delightful to a
man, whilst his appetite serves; so are they a most troublesome sort of
Cattle, when a Lover begins to retreat: They are Killing, Stabbing, and
Poisoning: Others there are that have a natural Aversion both to Love and to
Mankind


Those sure are Monsters in Nature!


They are dough-bak'd Women; there wanted heat at their Generation: And there is
as great a difference betwixt them and other Women, as in the Chickens that are
hatched by the heat of an Oven, and those under a Hen


There is a great difference indeed: But now as to your Business! I will not say
it is above my Power; but as I cannot absolutely effect it without the utmost
severity of Art, and the most rigorous of my Conjurations, to assemble the
Spirits that are most stubborn and difficult to obey; so it cannot be done in a
day; and you will not in less than six Months perceive that I have compassed
for you what you desire


But will you assure me that in Six Months or such a time, I shall have power
over all Women that please my fancy


There is one little difficulty which incapacitates me absolutely to promise;
but if that obstacle were removed --


What is it?


I shall need a Composition of Gold, which is a Sovereign Metal, and is
essentially necessary to my performance of this Affair


I understand you: There are 40 Guinneys for the present, I was just going to
offer it you


Nay, -- I ask not any for my self; I Will freely bestow my pains, but this is
for an Ingredient; my Spirits shall go to work upon these, and have time enough
to talk before the six Months are expired


I shall live in a great expectation of the good hour.


I would willingly have contrived to have done you the Kindness without putting
you to the Expense, but that it was impossible to be done without an Extract of
Gold; which truly prepared and rightly administered, will have a strange
Dominion over the Spirits of Women. You see what Miracles it works in its
simple Native state, with its gross Elements about it; what then will it do
when my Spirits have ref^'d it, by the help of my Art


And how is it to be used?


I convert it into Powder; which put into a Gold Case, with some Ceremonies
used to it, and mystic Characters engraven upon it; and wor^ about your Neck,
will have a secret power to produce a Sympathy in the Breasts of all Ladies,
for whom your Heart feels any Inclination: And as your desires increase or
abate, so will their loves to you. --


You are an admirable Woman if you effect this.


Nothing can hinder't but your want of Faith.


Which shall be strong, that your Charms may prove so too.


I Will go to her, stay you here; and when he is gone, give us notice.

Sir, I must leave you, some urgent* Occasions require me within; but rest
confident and assured that from my Art you shall become a Bean Gorson amongst
the Ladies


Having made it my Business so long to decry this Woman, and called every body
Fool that had any thing to do with her; am I my self after all become her
Bubble? her demand of Gold for an Ingredient, looks like a Wheedle: And besides
the present Sum* she has laid her Train to draw more from me for the future:
But yet her revealing to me my Pistols, and her discovery of the Cheat of the
pretended North Country Heiress, are things that persuade me to a Confidence
that she can do strange matters: But if she should Cheat me after all -- I Will
have the wit to hold my tongue, and not let it be known; so I shall not be laughed
at, at least --


Dame, Mr. Gerrard is gone.


MRs. Prudence, walk in here then.


stand you Sentinel, and give me timely notice who comes.

Come now to our China Vessel; what became of the Jarr.


I came on purpose to give you an account, when we went up to Bed, we locked the
Door on the inside, she laid the Key under her Bolster. The question then was,
whether we should put out the Candle or not? at last we considered, that if we
should see the Spirit, the sight would fright us out of our wits. And that it
would be enough to hear it fall! That done, I had the string ready which I had
prepared with a running knot, and as I came to Bed in the dark from the
Chimney, where I put out the light, I stepped and put it over the Neck of the
Jarr; and unwound the bottom all along, as I crept to the Bed side. -- I was no
sooner laid, but my Lady crept close to me, and clasped her Arm round my
waste, and every now and then fancying a Noise, she would say -- Oh we are undone!
we are undone! but with a soft low voice, for she was afraid to cry out, lest
the Spirit should know we were there


How could you forbear laughing?


With much ado, at last I gave the Cord a twitch, down comes (...) Urn, the
noise made her shreik out. -- I seconded her with ah, I am dead, (...) dead:
She slunk down over head and ears in the Bed -- I did the same; (...) half an
hours Palpitation of the heart, not daring to stir or speak all that (...) till
she was almost smothered. She bid me get up and see in what condition (...)
Jarr was


Broken all in pieces, I warrant you!


No, the Jarr it self was whole, it happened to fall upon the Quilt of the
Couch, and from thence rolled down upon the Tapestry Carpet that was spread
upon the floor of the Alcove; but the Cover fell so, as it broke in the middle


What said she then?


She past away the rest of the Night in a great deal of disquiet, lest her old
man should not die; she will come to you -- sometime to day, to know what
Comfortable News you will give her; at present she is much disheartened


I Will satisfy her when she comes, I warrant you.


Now I have told you all, I Will begone: I stole out to come hither. And if I am
mist must make some excuse


Yes, for she must not know you have bin here.


Dame -- here is Mr. Heartall come to speak with you.


He knows me to belong to my Lady, I Will put my Hoods over my face, and steal by
him


No, go out that way, Beatrice will show you.

Well Sir, -- How goes our Business?


Nothing better. After I left you yesterday -- I went two or three miles out of
Town in a Hackney-Coach, the Glasses drawn up that nobody might see me. Toward
Evening I took Post, and came to Town, and light from my Horse at my Widows
Door, by good luck she was just then looking out of the Window, expecting me;
she received me with joy. We entered into a serious discourse of Love, and
after a thousand Protestations of Kindness, she assured me that within three
days I shall be entirely happy


She Will Marry you then.


We then made a Contract before witness. That Circumstance of kissing her
Picture in my Retirement, wrought much upon her: She thinks she cannot enough
reward my fidelity


I am glad I contributed so much to your Fortune.


I Will ever acknowledge your Favors; but let me tell you, That what you have
done for me, redounds much to your advantage, and has extremely advanced your
Reputation: She has told somebody what past yesterday betwixt you, it is in
every bodies mouth. -- I have already met four or five of my Friends (...) have
inquired of me if it was true, that I was yesterday Thirty miles off


Do not undeceive 'em by no means.


Never. I protested to 'em all, that I was at Tunbridge; and that (...) (...)
Post and came to Town upon account of a Letter I received at Twelve (...) (...)


The Colonel is come.


I find you are full of Practice still: I Will come again in the Evening, and
bring my thanks with me for all your Kindness


You need not concern your self about that: I think my self indebted to you,
that you have given the World this Confirmation of my Skill, so much to my
advantage. And I will rest extremely well satisfied -- if you will but stay and
discourse the Colonel a little: He Is an unbelieving Enemy of mine, and I would
do all I can to bring him over to my side, and in this you may serve me


It Is ten to one but he will be enquiring, the truth of this Business; and a
Confirmation from my mouth may prevail much


I Will retire, and give you opportunity. Take no notice that you have spoke with
me yet; but say you are told I am very busy upon some great Design


I Will observe Orders.


Go Beatrice, bring in the Colonel.


How, Mr. Heartwell in Town!


A Letter which I received yesterday at Noon from the Party you know of,
brought me so soon to Town; She was at last so kind to Command my return


She was here yesterday to consult Dame Dobson in matters relating to you; and
as she herself affirms, Dame Dobson showed her you in a Glass kissing her
Picture


It Is true, that I often paid my Devotions to her Picture when I was absent.


And that she writ to you to Tunbridge at the same time, to come with all speed
to Town, and a Spirit conveyed her Letter, and brought back an Answer from you
in less than a quarter of an hour


What is it you tell me? Yet now I think on it, her Express must have bin the
Devil, otherwise he could not have bin here before me


Then you believe it was the Devil.


Perhaps you only tell me this to laugh at me, or try my Confidence in this
Woman, because you find me here: But it is very true that in my Solitude I was
musing on my Window, and kissing her Picture just when the Messenger (...) me
the Letter


You did kiss it then, and she writ to you, and you answered the Letter
immediately? I know not what to think


I am as much surpised as you, but I wondered I could not overtake the
Messenger; for I mounted immediately, and had a Horse under me so fleet, I
durst venture to run him with most New Market Racers; yet he was (...) (...)
fore me, and had delivered my Letter long e're I came


The Circumstances of your confirmation render it yet more (...) Did you not
stop by the way


No, -- I rid as if it had bin upon Life and Death.


I confess now I know not what to think of this Cunning Woman.


I do not know whether it may be proper for me to enquire any thin^ of her now
or not, concerning this matter * I came to be resolved in some doubts relating
to my Mistress, but she having bin here before, I Will let it alone: Besides I am
told here, that old Dame Dobson is extremely busy. -- I have outstay'd my time
already, and I cannot conveniently tarry any longer -- beside, Colonel, I owe
that respect to you


I hope I am not the Occasion of your going away, my business is but Curiosity,
-- I am in no great haste


I have altered my mind, since you have told me she has bin here, and and in
two or three days I shall be resolved in my scruples, if the Widow keeps her
word: And I think I need not doubt it after those assurances which she has
given me since my coming to Town


I am glad to hear you are so far advanced toward your Happiness.


It Is so. -- Colonel, Your most humble Servant.


Well Sir, your North Country Lady. Where?


She Is afraid to come, but that is pardonable in a Woman; I confess you
surpised me, I did not think you could have found out that we came to put a
trick upon you. And I more wonder at that, than I should at your Familiar or
Devil, you talked of showing us. --


O it is a hard thing to deceive me. I hold intelligence with those Spirits that
inform me of every thing


Come, leave talking of Spirits, those are Stories to be told to Women and
Fools; let me understand the reality of the thing


O Dame!


What Is the matter, Beatrice?


Here Is the rich Country Gentleman come to Town again, he that told you (...)
many Thousand Pounds he got by Farming the Chimney Money of his County


What he that we fobb'd out of his Money with our Counterfeit Widow!


The same!


Tell him I am not at Home.


I have; but he swears and stares. And says, he will search every Rome in the
House


Say -- I am not at leisure; and that there is a Person of Quality with me.


I told him that too, when he said so; but he swore busy or not busy, (...)
speak to you. And would come in, though all the Devils of Hell were (...) ^ou


His coming at this time will ruin me.


All I could prevail with him in, was but to have patience, till I came in,
(...) ^old you he was at the Door


I must not speak with him till the Collonel's gone; if he sees me (...) open
his Throat, and out with all before him. And then there'l be no come off for me


I perceive, Dame, you are disturbed; what is the matter?


There is without a Rustic sort of a Country Gentleman, that will not be
denied Admittance; one that comes to be angry with me upon a mistake, at
another time I should have good sport with him: But now his presence would be
troublesome, and divert me from pleasuring you in what you have a mind to know
or see


Let him come in -- I Will give him his answer. I am here first.


Doubtless -- he will have respect to your Garb and Quality. Let him come any
other time, and I Will satisfy him in all he can demand


Call him in.


I Will retire in the mean time to dispatch another small Affair in order to my
Business with you. Call him in Beatrice, I Will be at my listening hole, when he
goes out follow him cl^se at heels, and bolt the Street Door after him. --


Ha, Noble Colonel!


Who, Mr. Farmer!


Lord, Colonel, who'd have thought to have seen you here?


Why do you wonder at that? You come here. Every body comes here. And I amongst
the rest


I am too much your humble Servant, not to inform you of what I know; you come
to a Woman here that is the greatest Cheat this day upon the Earth: if I
should tell you what a Trick she has played me. --


How! And every body tells such wonders of her?


Ay, a Company of Fools like my self. I have bin her Milch Cow, till of late;
but my eyes are open: if you will have patience to hear it. I Will give you a
Relation of the Jigg she has played me


What, she has conjured for you then!


Oh finely, under pretense of helping me to a rich VVidow, has cheated me out
of 600l. but that is past, such an Owl as a Country Clodpate was; a fine Bird
for her to pluck


She has had good store of your Guinneys then!


She is a Cutpurse, a Cutthroat; be you judge of the fine Doings of my Dame
Dobson, who has conspired with that Cockatrice to Cheat me of such a Sum; but
I Will have her apprehended, and Burnt for a VVitch, or Hanged for a Cheat at
least


Be not in haste, she may come off by saying that what you reproac^ her with,
is but a story of your own Invention; I came here to have some proofs of her
Conjuring, I shall catch her in her Roguery, and that joy^'d with your Charge
against her, will make well for your purpose and mine too


Now I am convinced, that all her Supernatural Informations and Conjurings are
mere Artifice and Cunning; yet she has showed me strange things that have
frighted me to the very heart -- And I know not, but you --


I am faithless of all that, and fearless. I Will put her to her Trumps; go you
to the next Tavern, and stay my coming, when I have done here I Will come to you,
there I Will hear your Story at large, we'll lay our heads together how to regain
your 600l. and be revenged on her, for the Injuries she has done me


I will be counseled by you; And I hope 'twill prove to the Advantage of us
both. Colonel, I Will expect you at the Rose


So -- Now to manage this Business to the best advantage.


What is he gone? why did not this Wench call me? where are you Beatrice? you
are so negligent in your Duty. I am sorry I did not know it sooner


He is but just gone.


You had much ado to persuade him then? --


He used many Arguments to stay, and pretended earnest business with you.


It Is a wonder he did not tell it you.


No!


'Twill be a fortunate Chuff; though at present he is in a peck of Troubles about
600l. which he thinks he is Cheated of: But is in the hands of a rich young
Widow, to whom he will certainly be Married in a very short time


Say you so? -- he is no very handsome Man.


But she loves him desperately; she came to me to know what kind of Husband
he will prove: I certify'd her from the infallible Rules of my Art: But she for
all that to try his Temper, persuaded me into a Plot against him, to see how
he will bear the loss of so much Money, and whether he will be more troubled for
the loss of her Person, or such a Sum


Then he will have the Money again by marrying the Widow.


She has ordered some Friends to pay him the Money a Month hence here in Town,
when she has heard what humor he is of


Then 'twas her he threatened, he called somebody Cheating Baggage several
times, and threatened; how will she like that? This may go nigh to break off
the Match


No: it is his Fate to Marry her. The Stars have so decreed it, and my Art has
foretold it; therefore it must be, but let us talk no more on it now another
time I Will tell you a pleasant Story how we have managed him in this Affair


This is a Cunning Devil: how she has confounded me again?


You were going on in a Discourse before we were interrupted. In which you
seemed to desire something of me, do you remember what you were going to ask?
--


I was pressing you to let me understand the mystery of your Practice, ^d the
reality* of your Art; for I know it is all but Subtlety, and Delusion: (...) may
tell me; I am not one that will hinder your advantage; every one must live in
the World, and I am a well-wisher to Ingenuity: I know that all persons from
the highest to the lowest act for their advantage, and Profit is the thing they
aim at


How! Profit! who do you take me for? There is no deceit-Sir in what I perform:
I am as good as my word to every Body; nay, I would not be worse than my word
to the Devil -- So far I am from what you say! --


I believe you. -- -- We ought to be as good as our word to every one: But yet
hold a little, Dame Dobson confess to me that the greatest of your Skill is to
know how to deceive Cunningly; and I Will esteem you the more for it: I will
commend your Ingenuity, and if you will show me how you manage your Affairs, I
will be more beneficial to you, than are the silly Fools you fright into such
admira^ion


Your false Presumption makes you insult too much; have a care you come to no
harm. I have not the least intention of ill to you; but here are those that
will take my part. And though you see nothing, they hear what you say in
derogation to my Honor, and their Power. And it is not safe for you to talk so
any longer


You speak this to a man that is insensible of fear. I laugh at all your Devils
and Familiars, and your Spirits of Intelligence: I defy 'em: Let 'em come: Let
-- 'em appear quickly. I Will play the Devil among'st 'em. What silly Business is
this! I can do as much when I please, my self; but I thought I heard something
fall down


Look nearer, and see what is there?


See: yes, without the least apprehension of fear.


It may be as stout Men as your self have bin afraid. Whence comes your
silence? what you are amazed


I did not expect this Sight of horror; a Humane Body torn Limb from Limb. Do
you Murder folks here


If you will take my advice, go your way.


I go away!


Never strive to hide it: I see fear has seized you.


I acknowledge I have some concern on me; But it proceeds only from the
misfortune of this poor mangled Wretch


Since you are so troubled at that, I Will bring him to life again. You go back,
and hang down your head; you are ashamed now to let me see that you are afraid;
but I Will forget you have insulted, and release you from this fright

Go! return from whence thou came, and be as thou were before the Power of my
Commands forced thee to appear. --


Where is the thing I saw? I perceived a Man to move toward me; where is it? I
would fain have spoken to it


Your Voice is faint and trembling; you told me you were one that feared
nothing


The Sight was so extraordinary, that I may well be allowed a little surprise;
but as for being afraid, you do mean injury if you think so


You changed Countenance more than once; what would you have done if I had
showed you what you have so long in vain endeavored to see


Ay the Devil. I Will give you a Hundred Guinnies to show me that Sight.


You d'be scared out o'your Wits.


I will be as good as my word if you can show me the Devil. And I Will then say
you are what you pretend to be, without that I am an Insidel still --


Since it is so -- I will. Fortify your self with Courage, and come again in the
Evening


You are in earnest?


In very good earnest: I Will see how courageously you will stand the brunt of such
an amazing Object. You Will be sure to come


Yes; but you will engage I shall return in safety.


Safe from every thing but your own fear: If fear kill you, I cannot help that.


May I not bring a Friend along with me?


No, you must come alone.


Adieu then Dame. I Will be sure to come.


You Will consider better on it; but come not, or come; your valor is but a
Bravado: I know the strength of your Constitution now. And since this Sight
made your Courage retreat so, the next shall rout it quite. And give it such an
overthrow, it shall never rally hereafter to my prejudice. And this Imports me
more than ever, now you are joined in Confederacy against me. --


MR. Decoy!


Where are you?


HEre, Mr. Goslin's come, and now you have a Devil in readiness for the
Colonel. I think I had best run and fetch the Lady; She stays only for my
coming to tell her you are at leisure


Do so, tell her I am alone, if any one comes in the mean time, you may carry
her into the next Room awhile; all things are prepared for her coming. Beatrice
has her* Instructions, and all will go well


She'il be very liberal, and she is a Woman frighted at the least thing
^imaginable, and will look upon any slight trick as miraculous. --


Go thou, bring her quickly that we may dispatch her, and have a clear-house
before the Colonel comes; as much frighted as he was at the Body torn
Piecemeal, yet perhaps he may venture to come again


You have a Devil ready harness't to entertain him. But I Will lose no more time.
-- I Will send you in a Customer -- I have without, who whil's* I step for the
Lady* will afford you diversion enough


This Decoy is a diligent fellow, I have thriven well e're since he has bin my
Confederate: Oh, here comes the Sheep I am to flecce

Who would you speak with Sir?


Was a great pig Gentleman of Wales look you. And her was come to look a
Gentlewoman, was call her Name Dobson


I am She!


Then look you Dame Dobsons, Got he knows, her was come to you, with very heavy
hearts look you. --


I afford present help for most Misfortunes. --


Was hear indeed that her was full of Conjurations. And that her keep tame
Devils, and Spirits and Familiars about you: Now her has bin Wedded, and
Married, and put together in Matrimonies one whole years, two days, and three
weeks, look you, without Portions with her Wife; because she was very good
Gentlewomans born, look you: But now her is grown full of Boldnesses, and was
tell her to her face, her did not Marry Iinkin for love; but her Diversions I
pray you: Then her was ride Huntings, and leapings over Hedges and Ditches, and
blowing Horns, with the best Hunters in Whales, look you


There Is no great harm in that, if she do not make you blow the Horn too!


Was know not that; but at last, look you, her leapt Hedges and Ditches so long
till her leapt away with 400 Pieces of good Red old Golds; But her so Cunning,
that her sent Scouts after her. And her was feen upon her Gallops to London in
Man's Apparels; so her come after, and as soon as her come to Town, her spied
her in the Streets with Hats and Feathers, and Swords by her sides like
Gentleman's, look you: So her presently threw her Cloaks over her Noses, look
you, that her Wife might not know her, for her had meanings to follow her, to
watch her and to dog her, and just then comes 200 Coaches and Carts and stops
poor Iinkin. So her lost her Wifes, and could never see her since


Would you have stopped her, if the Coaches had not hindered?


No: Got he knows; for her would have drawn her Swords and Weapons, and killed
her Husbands like a Man


That is to say, you were afraid to be beaten.


Not asraid; but was not willing to be provokt to wroths and indignations, look
you: For Got he knows, when a Welchman's Blood is up, all the Devils in her,
was not lay it again; But pray you, look you, can you Conjure hers to this
place, and give her Love-Powders, and great deal of Charms to make her have
Kindnesses and good Wills toward Iinkin, her Husband; but I doubt you cannot
do that, because I know the Devil is in her already, look you, because she
plays such pranks* I pray you


I could bring her hither, tho she were on the very Top of Penman Moor; But it
requires much Labor and Ceremony to new mould a Woman's Heart, and alter her
Affections: besides it will take up long time


Iinkin can have patience, if Dame can put love into her.


Give me then 9 Pieces of Gold for an offering to the Spirits which I must make
use of to Conduct you^ Wife hither to put'em in good humor


Nine Pieces? An able Lawyer has but five: Zownch -- And why should the Devil
have more Fees than the Lawyer


Know you not that 9 is a mysterious Number? and very significant?


Why! was her Devil deal with Mystery in Numbers?


The greatest mystery in Nature is in Numbers; and especially in this Number 9.
find me the like again in all Arithmetic, 3 times 1 make 3. And 3 times 3 make
9


Got he knows it was very pretty.


If you observe, 9 is composed all of odd Numbers; each including the other
proportionably; for as 3 is the result of 3 Unites; So Nine is the result of 3
Threes


And was it much better I pray you for being odds?


Numero-Deus impare gaudet, Spirits are pleased with odd Numbers, says Virgil
the great Astrologer


Zounce, you was out Dame Conjurers! Got he knows Virgil was very good Poets --
but her was no good Astrologers


One of the greatest that ever was. Do not you see he has bewitched all the
World with his Verses ever since? And has put so strong a Charm in them 'twill
last so till Doomesday; Nobody that reads 'em can refuse liking 'em


That was very truths look you, indeed was have no great Acquaintance with
Virgil in Whales, and yet Virgil was her Cozen afar off, and a very good Bard;
but mark you, was her know he writes Verses in Whales, better than her Cozen
Virgil does: look you Dame, here was 9 pieces of red Gold for your Spirits,
your Devils and your Hobgoblins: And of all loves, I pray you get Iinkin his
Wife again


Doubt not.


I pray you, look you if her have one Welsh Devil in all her Flock, and commend
her lovingly to her, and tell her Iinkins was her own Flesh and Bloods, and her
own Cozen Germans


I Will enquire their Countries and Pedigrees: Now to show that you freely
consent to the Charm; blow 3 times upon it as hard as you can --

Harder yet: So -- come again to me four days hence; and then I Will give you an
^ount how your affairs stand. And when the Devil will fetch your Wife


How the Devil fetch her Wifes! -- Zownce -- no.


Fetch her to you only: and then I Will prepare a Philtre or Love Potion, shall
make her dote on you hereafter


Look you, pray you! make her very strong Glisters of Love that may keep in her
Bodies, and work up to her hearts, And that will do it, look you


I know what is fit to be done.


Got be with you Dame Dobsons, and all your Devils.


I have listened to this Welsh Customer with a great deal of Pleasure.


Against he comes next, I le invent some Story shall make him deposite a
greater Sum. What a number of Fools will make me more cunning in spite of my
Teeth? Every one increases History: And rather than it shall not seem
Miraculous, tells lies to make it appear so


Your Welshman returns.


Look out, and see what is the matter?


Dame Dobsons, Dame Dobsons.


What Is the matter!


Her come to tell you Woman's, you have wonderful Skill in Conjurings; as her
was on the Stair Case, and hearing Pratlings below, was look down and saw her
own Wife talking with your Maids, look you


Are you sure you saw your Wife?


Zownce her knows her own Wifes and her own Spouses, or the Devil was got into
her likenesses, with her Hats and her Feathers


No, it was your Wife: I did it to let you see your Money was not thrown away;
your present to the Spirits of 9 pieces has obliged 'em mightily: And made 'em
as willing to serve you, as if you were a Lord. And now you see what virtue is
in number 9


Her will put all her Silver into 9 Pences for this, and all her Golds into 9
Pounds; But look you Dame Dobson, will not your Devil wait on her Wifes up
here? Zownce her would fain see her


You must not be seen by your Wife yet: 'Twill hinder the Operation of my Spell.


Then Iinkin was glad her own dear Wifes did not see her own Husband^


Next time you come bring 20 l. with you for the Love-Powder: It Is made of all
the dear things that can be. And will cost you so much if you have of the best


Her would have of her best, look you; because her Wifes has very little
affections for poor Iinkins -- And her would have her love her very much. --


You shall -- Within there.

Conduct him out at the back Door. --

Chance is often very kind to me; if Fortune favors me thus but a little
longer* I shall have no more need of Spies and Intelligencers


According to the description given me, you should be Dame Dobson.


You are not mistaken.


I have Business with you of great Concernment.


Who could refuse any Courtesy to so pretty a Gentleman?


You are pleased to rally me; but to my Business -- I am so happy to have
something in me that is not unpleasing to a great many Persons. --


And I doubt not but you make the best use on it. --


I do my endeavor; but every thing falls not out to my mind. There is one
little Obstacle that hinders; and I come to desire you to remove it


Come, to particulars! --


It Is this, -- I see every day a great many fair Ladies, things very agreeable
to my Age and Constitution; of four or five that I am acquainted with, and not
altogether hated by, there is one that is Mrs. of her self and rich: It Is said
she is worth 10000 l


You Would have a Charm to make this Lady marry you?


Perhaps she desires it as much as I: She Is handsome, young and spritely: And
we seem as it were created for one another. But --


But what, little Cavalier?


The Devil on it is -- you can Divine what it is I want. What I would have you do
for me, I believe is not Impossible. -- See, there is my hand --


The Judgments we frame from the hand are too uncertain, it gives but an
Imperfect knowledge. -- I am no great Friend to Chyromancy. -- I shall be able
to inform you more by Casting your Nativity. -- 'Tell me in what day of the
Month you were born


The 16th of November.


The first Letter of your Name?


It begins with C.


Of your Surname?


J.


My pretty little Gentleman, what fair Lady soever you are in love with -- Come
to me. And what favors you would have her grant, through my means -- you shall
obtain


By what Secret must it be done?


The 10000 pounds are not for you; you are a Female your self.


I love you for that: what because I ha'nt a Beard yet, you think (...) Woman!
Have I the Air of a Woman, think you? See this Hat* this (...), this adroitness
to draw my Sword


You have a manly Grace in all you do; but still you are a Woman.


You have mistaken something, you have not cast my Nativity (...)!


I Will tell you presently, You have bin Married a year and odd Months. Your
Husband is very Rustical. You have little Kindness for him, though he took you
without a Portion. You absent your self from him. -- He knows not what is
become of you: And what little Gold you have, you took from him without his
knowledge. --


Augh -- It must be the Devil that told you all this; for without Exception,
not one living Soul knows any thing of my concerns, nor of my coming hither. I
lodge at an old Ladies, and pass for her Nephew. -- I in^rusted nobody else
with the secret of my being a Woman -- but she knows nothing of all the rest


Are you satisfied now as to your But --


I am dropped out of the Clouds: I wonder no longer People cry you up so: I am of
their mind now; and shall speak in your Commendation as much as any body


My Reputation is of too great Concern to me to forfeit in trifling things;
what I undertake, shall deserve admiration from the wisest and most penetrating
Judgments. --


I believe your Ability to be such, that you can do every thing. -- Dame, do so
much as change my Sex for me, and make me a Man


Make you a Man?


I know you can if you will. -- I Will consider you well for it: I Will be bountiful
--


You have a strong fancy for the 10000 l.


I nauseate my beastly, ill-bred, rustical Husband; were I a man, I Would be
unmarry'd from him; And then I should have rare Game amongst the Ladies. -- I
could then proceed bravely in my Designs: It Is this habit that inspires me with
boldness to talk to 'em; they hearken to me so willingly* and seem so pleased
with the least Courtship I make, that I am almost mad to see my self in so fair
a way to make a short business, to want the principal Verb to make me happy.
Well -- of all Conditions, that of a Woman is most miserable! -- I have a Hat
and a Sword toward Manhood: Come -- supply the deficiency of Nature -- Suit my
Body to my Soul. And make me a Man complete in all points: for I am resolved
never to quit the habit. --


I hear you for mirth sake: But you have too much discretion to be serious
in it. --


I am very serious and in good earnest: I swear I would be a man (...) my
heart! --


I doubt it not: And so would a great many besides your self -- such a secret
as that to transform a Man to a Woman or a Woman to a Man, would make me a rich
Woman indeed


Since you could tell me all that you have told me: And what nobody knew but
myself. -- I am convinced nothing is Impossible to you. -- I am extremely
delighted with your Knowledge


Whenever you have a mind to make use of my Art to reconcile yo^ to your
Husband, and bring matters about there. --


Pish -- He Is more concerned at the loss of his Money, than his Wif^*


Observe me: The best course you can take, is to appease him* would you always
play the Libertine thus? And have no regard to your Honor? -- If you will be a
better Wife to him hereafter than hitherto you have bin -- I have a Powder
shall make him love you better than ever


I ^on't want Money yet; when that time comes -- we'll talk more on it: Till
then I Will take all the Diversion this habit can afford me -- I live now the
pleasuntest life in the World. And I Will not quit it till I am formed to it:
Adieu -- Dame, I give you nothing now -- Because I intend to see you again very
suddenly


Fare you well, little Bully -- have a care how you d^aw amongst the Ladies;
'twill be ill incountring there for you. --


I warrant you -- I am Soldier Skilful enough to know how far to advance --
and to make a safe retreat. --


This was as lucky, and as pleasant an accident as ever yet happened to me
since I first professed the Art of Divination, the Husband and Wife to come at
the same instant. --


Enter Madam, enter.


No, no, -- I will not go in, -- I repent I am come so far as I am. -- ah -- ah.
--


What Is the matter, Madam?


I thought I saw a Spirit behind me, a huge tall black hairy thing.


'Twas nothing but the shadow of the Gentleman that went down Stairs --
recollect your self -- See there is Dame Dobson


Ah -- ah -- ah- Sir, I beseech you do not let her come so near me!


I Will stand betwixt you and her. -- What are you afraid of Madam?


Her very looks fright me: O she is most terrible.


It Is a mere fancy -- she is made like other Women.


Madam -- Please to tell me, what you desire: Be not bash^ul, I know the
secrets of a great many. --


O la -- a -- I -- a -- I am in love; a --


O very well -- And who is it that is not in love? if you knew as well as I,
what a world of People are infected with that Distemper, -- you will say 'twas
more Catching than the Plague, though but few dye on it in our Age. --


I am glad for this Ladies sake it is not Mortal.


Is love a Distemper then, say you?


Oh a great one, it distempers People so sometimes, that they cannot scarce eat
or drink -- or rest quiet in their Beds. -- Nay, some are distempered even to
Madness -- especially when Jealousy is joined with it --


My Condition just -- she is a very learned Woman.


Tell her, tell her -- what you would have.


Come Madam, -- Let me understand your Condition; descend to ^ticulars.


Be pleased to know then Dame -- That I* am but a Citizen's Wife; -- (...)* say
truth, my Father was a Citizen; but my Husband is an Alderman


Very good. --


He was a little elderly when I married him: And because he was very rich, my
Parents would have it a Match


So. --


I never much loved him to say Truth; -- yet -- He Is a very kind man to me --
Lets me have what I will -- do what I will -- and go where I will


A very good sort of a Husband. --


Yes, -- he is kind to me in all this; but he takes very little notice of me as
I am a Woman -- unless it be a Sunday Nights that we go to Bed betimes. And
then I swear it goes against the grain with me -- he does so grunt -- and -- oh
I don't like him as a man at all. --


You may have good reason* -- There are many such in the City that maintain
their Wives well -- They are generally good Husbands, but ill Lovers: A woman
is seldom very unhappy in a Husband, unless he debars her of Liberty in such a
Case, and is stingy or jealous


Madam, please to go on and tell her your self. --


I have a Kindness for a certain person -- a Gentleman, and one that I have
found great satisfaction in; a man so different from my Husband, that were*I
but assured of his Constancy -- I should believe my self the happiest Woman
living. --


What reason have you to doubt it?


Within this Month I have had a great Suspicion my interest is sacrificed to a
Rival -- he takes all the Caution imaginable to hinder me from knowing it. And
to persuade me that he loves no body but me


You must let her know all -- She maintains him answerable to his Quality -- So
that by her means, he makes as good an Appearance as any Gentleman need* --


All this shows a very generous Disposition: He is then Madam your Pensioner.


Yes, I keep him; but I would not willingly he should oblige another a^my
Expense: And if I knew that he was disloyal, I would retrench my Civilities as
to all that. --


And with very good reason. --


B^t on the otherside, The Lady would be very loath to quarrel with ^im if it
be so, that he loves no body but her


It Is a nice point; and you do well to search into it; for otherwise you would
but expose your ^elf to the laughter of your Rival: or lose your Gal^ by
q^elling with him to no purpose


You say all in a word.


Auh -- She Is a profound Woman.


I Will -- let you know the truth of this Business presently.


By what means? -- Ah I am undone -- She Is going to send some of her Spirits to
me, I Will begone --


Look to your self: some of 'em will be upon your back at the Door* if you
offer to stir


What Is the matter with you, Madam?


I find my self very ill -- on the sudden. -- I Will come again another time!


Let me loosen your Stays, perhaps you are too strait laced?


Eh, no -- ah --


Don't come near her: She Is so very tender, you cannot touch her without hurting
her


I find it now, the Lady's afraid; but let her not be frighted, instead of my
ordinary Apparitions and visionary Intelligences, I Will only by my Art raise the
Head of the Idol Abelanecus, which spoke so wonderfully in former Ages, and
which shall give her a just account of what she pleases to know --


The head of Abelanecus! a Head!


When you have heard what that will say, you need no longer be in doubt. --


Will it speak!


It shall speak.


And shall I hear it? --


You shall hear it.


No, no, I Will not hear't, that is for certain; for I Will begone this very Minute.
Now I have neither Love nor Curiosity. -- And I Will reward you to your wish for
curing me of two such evils. --


Eh Madam, -- when you are once entered here, there is no going out as you
Imagine


What do you mean Madam? You Will undo your self; here are swarms of invisible
Spirits all round you: And if you affront their whole Society so grossly, as to
go away before you have heard the Answer of Abelanecus his Idol: They Will come
upon you with their Talons, and tear you to pieces. --


What! would you have me stay and talk with the Devil?


Thousands would be glad to have a sight of him, that never could obtain the
favor


They need only come to you!


They may often come to no purpose: He will not speak to every one, and he must
love you very well -- if --


How! love me! The Devil love me! I Will say my Prayers. He shall not love me, I
defy him. And --


Hold, hold, hold -- for Heavens sake do not provoke him: Don't speak so loud,
Madam. Every body cannot have his Friendship: if you should anger him where are
you then


What say you, Madam!


That she is very much obliged to the Devil for his Civilities.


Believe it Madam -- He Is at your service -- I Will go my self for the Head, that
is to be your Oracle; for she will suffer no body but me to come near her: I give
you notice before hand -- That you must not show any sign of fear; -- I will
not answer for your safety if you do


Whither have you brought me here! what shall I do, not to seem afraid -- I
cannot hold a Joint still for trembling


Think what a Satisfaction 'twill be to know the truth, that you may (...)
longer be fooled by a Man; when you have heard what the Head says, you will know
what to resolve for the future


But the question is how I shall do, to hear it speak, and not show any ^ar? --
I shall never be able to go through't. -- eh he, eh --


Oh Madam! don't hide your Face, look up! the Devil is not so horrible a Sight
as you Imagine. --


Come near, Lady -- The Head is in readiness to speak to you.


Let it begin -- I can hear it hither.


If you would make much on it, she would speak the freelier to you; Go and salute
it. --


Salute Her! Mercy upon me, not for all the world.


I Will go and salute her for you! -- How pleased she is -- See Madam*


I dare not, -- ah, ah -- But why am I in such a fear? It may be it is but a
Vision! a mist cast before my Eyes


A Vision Lady? It may be you think I put tricks upon you. You shall soon be
satisfied of that --


Touch me.


Or. save me, save me!


Now go and see if it be a Vision.


Touch me.


Save me! what will become of me?


Madam, why would you offer to say --


Oh I shall dye -- I shall dye.


Go presently and touch her; if she calls a Third time you are a lost woman:
She Will fly upon you


Come Madam, come boldly.


Touch me.


Ah quickly, -- quickly.


Well then, since there is no remedy, I need not go any nearer. -- I see
plainly, it is a Head, a real Head


That Is not enough -- you must touch it with your bare hand.


Forward -- forward.


Eh, eh, eh. The motion of its Eyes have frighted me horribly.


So -- the other step.


Now lay your hand upon her, you shall have no hurt: So, now ^o farther off if
you please, you have touched it. Now ask her what Questions you will


Need I use Ceremony?


No, -- no.


Make have Madam, that we may be gone.


Stay, -- let me recollect my self a little: Tell me Madam Head, does the party
I love, love me


Yes.


Does he love any Woman but me?


No.


Does he not often go and visit Mrs. Bridget?


Sometimes.


For what I beseech you, Madam Head?


To serve his Friend.


Shall it never redound to my prejudice?


Not in the least.


I Will know no more Dame. Here, here is Money; Take Purse and all, Adieu, -- I am
almost out of my Wits. Sir, I beseech you not to leave me, till you have seen
me safe at home again


I Will wait on you, Madam --


Here is a good Lump. -- The Purse weighs heavy -- her fear was such, that
she would give it me all, rather than stay to count our part


I may venture to come out now, to fright 'em soundly is a sure way to get good
store of Money; for I have observed all along, that the most fearful are the
most liberal


Away! Clear the Room! Some body comes.


Dame! where are you, Dame?


Mrs. Hellen what now?


Ah -- I had much ado to get to you: The Colonel has a design to surprise you
-- he and others have prevailed with the Countess to come with him once more,
he has placed her and others in readiness to come in at a sign givenwhich is
shooting off a Pistol


Say you so?


He has got a Constable, and a Warrant, that if the other way ^il* he may have
you before a Justice. I Will put on a Mask and slip by him to give you notice


Well enough. How! the Lady Noble here!


I Will begone before she enters.


Beatrice! Run up into my Chamber, put up all the loose Plate to the rest in
the great Trunk, where my Money is. There Is the Keys. And all my (...) light
Furniture into other Trunks. And let 'em be carried down into the (...) quickly


Yes. --


Your Ladiship's come in a most unlucky hour. -- I am very busy.


Ay Dame, I am afraid all hours will be unlucky to me.


Why so, since I saw you I have found by looking in my Magic Glass, that your
old Knight is as good as a dead man --


Upon that condition I Would give 500 l.


I have said, and it cannot be otherwise.


O but the Urn, the Urn!


Ay, ay, -- broke, broke, that is assurance enough --


No, no, -- it is not broken!


Not broken, what! will your Husband receive a Bruise on the Head by a strange
accident, of which he will dye in a Months time, and your Urn not broke! your
Ladyship does not do well to tell me such Stories


The Urn it self is whole: But the Cover indeed broke in two.


Oh the Cover, and is it not sufficient! is not the Cover a part of the Urn,
and signifies the Head? is not this Demonstration now, your Ladiship's a
strange Woman


Dame Dobson, be not angry; your Interpretation has satisfied me, and to show
it has, here is the reward in Gold which I promised you. --


I Will take it, because I will not give your Ladyship the trouble to carry it back
again: Therefore I Will lay it up for you: I Will not make use often, nor count it
mine till a Month hence, that your Husband is Dead and Buried. --


And will it be in a Month?


Yes, in a Month. --


For certain!


I Will Pawn my Reputation. Hark, -- whilst you and I have been talking here, my
great Devil is broke loose


Broke loose! what will become of me! what will become of me!


Begone as fast as you can. -- I Will begin my Charm and stop him.


Ah the Devil, the Devil. -- eh, eh. --


The Colonel, and Mr. Gerrald are below.


In company together!


Yes.


The meaning of that, Gerrald is revolted: Tell the Colonel I am (...) up in
my Closet, preparing my Charms for his Business. That I shall ^ave finished them
presently. But expect to find him alone, and when you have delivered the
Message, come and get Porters, and go with my Trunks to a Friend's house, where
I Will send 'em for Security, lest things should happen amiss


Yes.


As you come, bid my Brother Gos^lin be sure not to appear till he hears me
whistle, and call him by his Devil's Name


Where is Dame Dobson?


Shut up in her Closet to perfect her Charms in order to the Business you come
about. -- She ordered me to call her when you were here; but told me that you
were to come alone


I met this Gentleman coming hither; but understanding mine is an appointed
Business, -- he is pleased to do me the favor to defer his till another time


I had only a question to ask which I forgot when I was here before.


I Will but speak two words with him, and he will begone.


I Will acquaint my Dame then --


Now let me hear how you intend to make this Discovery: And lay Dame Dobson
open to the World for so great a Cheat as you say


I have run her up to a Project, which I think cannot fail; a while since she
gave me the Diversion of seeing a Man's Body torn Limb from Limb


Diversion do you called?


I seemed amazed to encourage her to show me more. And feigning my self afraid
to look upon the Body: I observed all the motion; The Limbs joined themselves
together. The Body erected it self, and walked about: The Device was very neat,
and cleverly performed; but how 'twas done, I don't apprehend


There are many Slights to deceive the Senses.


The surprise and fear I expressed, drew her on to promise me, that she would
raise the Devil for me to day. I Will Counterfeit a fear still, that she may not
go back from her word: if I can but once get hold of her Devil, I Will make him
Dance. And this is it for which I sent for you, and other Friends to be in
readiness; in whose presence I mean to uncase her Devil, that you may be
Witnesses of the Cheat, and help to divulge it, that the Town may no longer be
imposed on


I Will retire to your Friends, and expect the Event.


Bid 'em be sure to detain all persons that are either coming in or going out.
-- -- And when they hear the Pistol go off, that is the Sign


I know it imports you very much to make a discovery; but I fear she will be too
Cunning for you


If I fail -- I know the Countess will upbraid my obstinacy, and the world
laugh at me -- but I willingly run the hazard of all that; since if I succeed*
the Countess yet is mine


I confess the venture is small in regard of such a Purchase; so proceed and be
successful


Colonel, I find you a man of Courage that you dare come again.


I assure they had need to have Courage that come to you; but I depend on your
word: you assured me I should receive no harm


Yes, but for all this you are still faint-hearted: Therefore bethink your self
whilst you have time


I Will deal ingenuously with you, that what you showed me last staggered me: you
found it out; and being ashamed of my former weakness -- ^ take this Occasion
to repair my Honor in your Opinion


Perhaps you will be less able to stand the shock now, then you were before; he
sight of the Devil is far more terrible than to see a humane Body in any
Posture or Condition


I promised you 50 Guinnics if you would let me see him, I have brought you the
Sum; if I am a little moved I shall have the satisfaction at least to see that
which Thousands of people are of opinion, ^obody has power to show


If you don't believe me, keep your Money; you shall see I am no^
selfinterested


You do this because you cannot be as good as your word.


Cannot! not as good as my word. Give me the Money, I Will not raise the Devil for
nothing. --


That is but reasonable. Take it.


You shall see one of the most formidable Devils of Hell; as you regard your
life, let him not see the least sign of fear upon you; not the trembling of a
joint, nor change of Countenance; if you do, you will be mangled as the Body I
showed you. You have heard already he is an unruly Devil


My heart is fortified, and I stand with resolution.


Prepare then at the third Invocation of his Name.


Proceed, I burn with Expectation.


Ho Madian! Madian -- Say, do you not tremble yet? does not your heart begin to
fail you? --


I rather believe your Art fails you: no sign of Devil yet. --


Upbraid me! Let all things then turn to Confusion -- justle ye Elements, and
flash your dreadful Lightnings forth to Usher in this direful Fiend of Fire and
Darkness


Your Mock-hell and puny flashes of Brimstone, fright not me, I see I stand
unmoved


Yet are you daring? Ho Madian -- that lie fast bound by my Charms, still be
obedient to their Power, and stir not forth till I revoke the Spells of your
Confinement


How! not see him appear?


No Sir.


Not unkennel your Devil, what is the meaning of this! why do you fool me thus?


In regard to your Safety.


Evasion, -- all Evasion.


Answer me, and upon your Honor answer me, -- for by my Art I know it is true.
(And therefore do it to avoid your Destruction, which would certainly follow)
for my Spirits will revenge me


What do you mean? what is it you know?


Nay, I know it already; and to let you see I do, I tell you from my spirit of
Divination, that you have bent your intentions to my Destruction, and in order
to it, are come with a resolution to surprise me; joined in Confederacy with
others


Ha!


It Is true, if by Conjurations I raise the Devil, you will accuse me to a
Magistrate for a Sorceress; if it prove no Devil, you will set the world in
clamor against me, Endite me for a Cheat. Say, -- is not this true; does not
this my Knowledge convince you I can do wonders


I do confess it; but your Knowledge is not so wonderful as you make it, that
Fellow that came running in such have, I perceive is your Intelligencer, It was
he waited upon the frighted Lady to her Coach. He Is one of your Spies that has
found it out, and given you notice; and you would have it pass for a piece of Skill


I know your Malice will upbraid me in every thing, and were it not that I would
not be guilty of your death, I Would convince you yet, and proceed in what I was
about; but your Intentions which are known to my Spirits, have filled 'em so
with Revenge and Malice, that they would tear you in pieces should I loose them
from their Dens


Do -- This is all Excuse, do -- I desie you and your Devils, and to encourage
you, I swear upon my Honor, Word, as I am a Man, show me but a Devil, you and
your Reputation shall be safe


I tell you your life is concerned; you cannot secure that against my Spirits,
nor me from Justice to answer for your Death; Therefore it cannot be done


You will not then?


It would ruin us both.


You will not do it then?


No.


You are resolved you wont?


I am.


Then I am resolved too, either to see your Spirits, or to let you see mine.


What mean you by that Pistol, to kill me!


No; but in this is a spell. And when this speaks, it conjures up my Devils.
There --


What Is the meaning of this?


You Will see presently. --


If I let loose my Devils. --


Do, and turn 'em to mine -- Let 'em fight helter-skelter; look you, mine are
entered the lists first; now where are yours


Mr. Constable come. Come in Officers.


Come Madam.


O la, oh.


I warrant you, Madam.


Your Ladyship may venture in: Here Is no danger I assure you.


Well Sir, has she showed you the Devil?


No, nor cannot.


How! cannot.


By her excuses she has confessed she cannot. --


There are not many in this Company -- I have a mind to satisfy beside this
Honorable Lady. -- Your Honor may please to know I have confessed (...) such
thing; and whether I can or cannot, is not convenient to acknowledge before
Company. I have given the Colonel Reasons why I don't comply with his desires
at this time, and he ought to be satisfied. --


O, nay, then* -- Indeed Colonel you are unreasonable.


You know his temper, Madam.


You are much to blame Sir.


'Twas ever my misfortune, that you would take her part: but without this we have
proofs sufficient to make it out, at least to spoil her Trading


I Will take Care of that. Come Conjurer, where is my rich Country Widow, I think
she and you own some few Hundreds of Guinnies


I know nothing of any Widow, nor of your Guinnies.


But time of Payment is come; what, because I have bin hunting after her, in
the Country where she talked of her Estate, lay; you thought I had given 'em
over for lost. And would not come to you for 'em -- o, o, o


Allegations without proof!


We shall find proofs enough both for that and other Cheats, that will bring
your Grannamship to the Whipping*post and Pillory


Come, come, Mr. Constable, take her into Custody.


Who are these?


Gillet here! This advantage is not to be lost. Mr. Constable, permit me to
speak a word with that Gentleman


Ho Dame, Give me joy, Dame.


Whist!


What Is the Matter? what do all these people here?


I Will tell that anon; are you Married?


The Parson has done his part, and we'll do ours anon; but take no notice to my
Wife you knew any thing of the matter; I brought her to see you, pretending to
know what good event we should have of our Marriage


Enough, you remember your Promise. Have you the Money?


That was one reason of my coming!


Let nobody see you give it me; so, now let me speak two*words to your Lady --
The Business is done I hear; you are Married


Yes, dear Dame, thanks to you.


Have you e're a Jewel for me?


I have Jewels in abundance. I Will give you this Locket upon my Arm, and (...)
to him I lost it


Enough.


Is not that my Cousin Clerim ont?


Yes sure.


But who is that with her?


It Is one Gillet, the rich Jeweller's Son in the City.


Cousin Clerimont, what has brought you here?


That which brings you and every one, Curiosity.


A word with you Cozen, what does he do with you?


A word with you in private.


What Dame, is this my Wife's Cozen!


Yes, -- yes, -- You hear he is.


Dame Dobson! Dame Dobson!


Hist! hist. What Is the matter!


What young Spark is this?


O Dame! my Husband spied me in the Street, and followed me* -- I came in here
to escape him


See -- he follows you in.


Good Dame cast a mist before his Eyes, that he may not see me.


I ha'nt time, mix your self with that Company, till I speak with him.


O Dame Dobsons.


Speak low, speak low.


O Dame! you are a rare Conjuring Woman's. Since I feed you and your Devils -- I
go no where, but I meet my Wifes -- her run from Iinkin, but now her is come
here I pray you give her some of your Love*Powders, for her has no good wills
to go for Whales without her own dear Wifes, look you


I could do it, were not for these People here; but they are of her new
Acquaintance here in Town, and will have heraway from you


Codsplutter-her-nails! take her Wife's away, look you --


Hist -- speak low. Mr. Gillet come hither. Observe me, here are two of you in
the same Condition; you have both of you Wives here; your Wifes Kinsman came to
me to know where you were, and brought a Constable with him to take her from
you, and intends to annul the Marriage


How!


You have not bedded her. Look to it, you must not let him carry her off.


Not as long as I have my charmed Sword.


Look you, this Gentleman is almost in your Condition. He has a Wife amongst'em
too; now if you can overcome this difficulty, and get'em away from'em, you and
your Wives will be happy as long as you live


Zounce if her had her black Bill out of Whales, her would fight 'em with that,
her would put her Enemies from her, and p^ll'em to her, and hit off their Ears,
and their Noses, look you


No matter; your Swords will do. You two must join together, and I Will raise a
Spirit to take your parts, shall fright'em out of their wits; a Spirit that was
famous in King Kadwalledar's days, and near of Kin to him


Her and her Cousen Devil, look you, will beat'em all. Cotsnownes her will have
her Wifes


And I mine.


Stand you two together, and when I whistle for my Spirit to appear, Draw your
Sword, and fall on those that stand next to me. They Will run from you, only
strike at'em; don't offer to kill'em


Come have you done, we'll stay no longer waiting on you.


Mr. Constable, we are ready; do your office as soon as you please


Give me leave a little Gallants, because my Reputation is so highly ^ncern'd,
and you all doubt my art, to vindicate my self from your Censures, and to
satisfy your Curiosities, I will before you all gratify the Colonel with the
sight of what he so much desired, and believes not in my power to perform


How!


No, no, ah.


Fear nothing.


This is but her Bravado.


O Madian, appear -- where?


Ah, eh, eh, eh.


Now Charm.


Cots Nownce! her will have her Wifes look you.


Hah, what is the meaning of this!


Ah, eh, eh.


Devil, have at the Devil.


Ha -- what is to do here?


Ha, Mr. Devil, have I caught ou?


Murder, Murder!


Be not frighted Ladies, Ple part em.


Zownce! let her alone! Her fights for her Wifes, and the Honor of ^hales, look
you. Her will give her the bloody Noses


Come! Devil speak, who are you?


Let her Cousin Devil alone, look you.


Speak, or this minute I Will run my Sword into you. --


Quarter^ Quarter -- I am no Devil.


Oh, are you no Devil at last: here you that Madam!


How! no Devil!


No Devil!


Here Is the He-Devil* but where is the Cheating old She-Devil?


I saw where she went down; but she shall not escape so with my Guinnies. I Will
after her, and ferret her out of her holes


While you search the Cellars, I Will unc^se this Devil.


Come Constable, come you all along with me.


Alas poor Dame, here is a foul surprise.


Come Devil, who are you?


Alas -- I am no Devil -- I am but a poor Town Clerk. --


A poor Town Clerk -- ha, ha, ha. Here Is a frightful Devil for you* ^dies.
Come, confess all: --


And please your Worship -- I came to Town about a Suit of Law* ^d hearing my
Sister practiced the ungodly black Art; she recounted to me fi^e Stories of her
Cunning, and showed me how all was done without any Conjuring or Knowledge in
the Stars; as plainly by her Practice is appeared to me: and at last being in
need of a Devil, she entreated the favor of me to serve her; and so if'^
please you -- in hopes of a better livelihood


You left your Clerkship for a Devil-ship?


Yes, an't please your Worship.


Now I think there needs no other Confirmation: what thinks your Honor now of
Dame Dobson


I confess I am ashamed and confounded, I know not what to say.


I hope you will not want a Charm of Oblivion now -- to forget me.


You have all the right in the world to insult.


This is such a surprise.


I hope your Ladyship too is convinced now, That there is no necessity now to
have a second Husband against your Inclinations


I find she is a Cheat, too much to my sorrow.


Here Is a wonderful Discovery.


My Husband lives, the Colonel is lost, my hopes are defeated; I Will retire and
grieve in private for my Misfortunes


Your Ladyship seems troubled.


I am so Sick with the fright, that I must beg your Pardon^ for my abrupt
departure. Your Servant


Now Gentlemen, let us know, what made you take her part, and fall upon us?


Cot in Heaven bless her life and limbs, and her shall not take her wives from
her: Her will have her nown Wifes, look you


But good Mr. Iinkin, her is resolved not to go down into Whales, look you; And
if her will have her Wifes, Her shall run for her VVive^, look you. --


Zownce and her will run so long as her has legs to carry her, look you.


And now Colonel -- I challenge my Wife; though Dame Dobsons Charm do not hold
good, as to my Sword: The Parson's Charm will not fail me as to your Kinswoman.
We are Married, Colonel


My Cousen has satisfied me in that particular; She is yours Mr. Gillet, and I
rejoice she has got so good a Husband


W^, I see q^ainly, Dame Dobson i^ ab Witch; yet truly merits the (...) (...)
Cl^ning (...)


Bring her in Mr. Constable; we caught her escaping at the great* Cellar. (...)
Neighbors inform us she had sent away her Trunks and bos^ Goods a little
before; but we have sent Scouts after to see where they lodg'd'em


O Dame I did you think to outwit the Colonel?


In six Months Dame, you and I shall have a small affair to unravel.


Stay till that time comes then.


But you and I must account sooner; you must refund 600 Guinnies.


And to me 50* for notshewing me a better* Devil than this poor Town Clerk
here: Now we have you again, I Will let him go


I thank your Worship; -- If ever they catch me a Devil-Acting again* -- I Will
give'em leave to make a Devil of me indeed. --


I must have 40; returning you my Sword with no Charm.


To call in all your Sums at once, is enough to break a good Banke^; but I Will
clear Accounts with you all, give me but time


Time!


Yes, time to speak: For your 50 Colonel, though I showed you no Devil; yet I
deserve'em for the good I have done your Family in helping this your Kinswoman
to a good Husband; saving her Reputation, and you the charge of Nurse-keeping:
And let her tell you if the Service I have done her, don't deserve'em, and 50
more


Cousen, Grudge her not that small Sum, on my account.


For your Sum, Gillet, I Will be judged by the Company, if I don't deserve'em for
helping you to so fine a Lady for your Wife, and a Gentlewoman, and of a Family
above the expectation of a Citizen


Yes, yes, that Score is cleared. --


Considering my Wife's a Fortune, I Will be more a Gentleman than to stand upon a
small thing


Now for your 500 l. Sir; because I have never done you any Service -- I Will
refun'd -- provided you will leave me in peace and quietness


For my part make restitution of my Money, I have no more to say. --


I Will pass mine in silence, for yet the world knows not any thing; and
therefore cannot laugh at me


For the good Service* Dame Dobson has done me, I am obliged to be (...)
Intercessor: And my re^est is, (...) all Pardon her what is past, and not
prejudice her Reputation by Discourses in Public, since'tis her livelihood,
and ingenuity ought not to be discouraged


Nay, let them tell all; if the World upbraid me, it will laugh at them; In this
Business it is more Credit to ^ceive than be deceived: I can practice yet in
remote Cities* or live upon what I have already gained; so I have no more to
say, but ^at I am ready Sir to count out your 600 Pounds. Coll. (...) (...) has
so much Skill to Divine, when I shall be absolutely happy in (...) Countesses
favor, she shall have her freedom


She is deceitful; But Colonel, if you have any Skill in Palmestry, read it --
There Is my Hand


Hence then I can foretell a Marriage near, and years of Happiness that shall
ensue, in spite of Planets, or their Malicious influence

Lovers that can like me with Patience wait,
Will tire their Evil Stars, and conquer Fate.

THo I am no great Conjurer you see,
Nor deal in Devil or Astrology,
Yet from your Physnomies I shrewdly guess*
The Poet stole the French Divineress.
But let not that, pray, put you in a passion,
Kidnapping has of late been much in fashion:
If Alderman did Spirit men away,
Why may not Poets then Kidnap a Play?
Poets are Planters, Stage is their Plantation;
But tho they are for Trade and Propagation,
Yet don't like Thievish Whiggs Rob their own Nation.
But, Fellow Citizens, beware Entrapping,
For, whilst you are busy sending Folks to Wapping,
'Ygad your Wives e'ne go abroad Kidnapping.
Tending to this, of late I heard such stories,
That I*for safety Married amongst the Tories.
And see from City Prigg I am become
A Beau Garcon, a man of the Sword: rare Thumb!
Jerne I am all Tory now, par ma foy
I hate a Whigg: I Am l'Officiere du Roy.
And now I bid defiance to the City,
Nor Whigg, nor Critic shall from me have pity.
And as in Valor, I in Wit am grown,
Then to'em Gillet; let them know their own.
You Whiggs, but Critics are amongst the Cits.
And Critics are mere Whiggs amongst the Wits.
Through your cross Nature you l no mercy show,
But would the Monarchy of Wit o're-throw;
And Critics here with the same spirit stickle
(...), as Whiggs in Conventicle.
(...) Sheriffs and Poets equally you ^ul
(...) in a Playhouse, they ^ Guild Hall.
(...) Noise, you see, and Faction often fails,
(...) is our Shield against your Prot'stant Flails.
Law and large Fines may send you all to Iails.
And if you Critics here are troublesome
I Will Diametrically upon you come,
And (...) you with my Charm, Firm, Close* Standfast Thumb!
Then there is your Wheadling Critic, seems a Friend,
Commends by halves; and with a But in the* end,
Has sly reserves which still to Faction tend.
They praise a Play, and on the Poet fleer,
But, his back turned, loll out their tongue and Ieer.
Thus amongst Wits, as Whiggs too, these are Trimmers,
They Are like a sort of Half Crowns we call Swimmers.
Broad to the Eye, but though the Stamp seems fair
Weigh 'em they are light, and damned mixed Metal are.
These blame the City, but uphold their Charter,
They Rail at Treason, but give Traitors Quarter,
And when a Rebel's hanged, they style him Martyr.
For Perjured Villains they would have Reprieve,
And to False Witnesses can Pensions give,
Yet will not allow a Mayor may choose his Sheriff.
They cry, to Magistrates we'll give all Honor:
But let us have Law: -- Then Holloo -- take him Coroner.
But, Friends, don't think that you shall longer Sham us,
Or that we'll Bugbear'd be by your Mandamus;
(...) see Dame Dobsons Devil long was famous,
failed at last: so will your Ignoramus.
