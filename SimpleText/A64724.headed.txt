WHO is it would be a Poet in our days,
When every Coxcomb crowns his Head with Bays,
And stands a saucy Candidate for Praise?
The Stage is quite debauched, for every Day
Some newborn Monster's shown you for a Play;
Art Magic is for Poetry professed,
Horses, Asses, Monkeys, and each obscener Beast,
(To which Egyptian Monarch once did bow)
Upon our English Stage are worshipped now.
Fletcher's despised, your Johnson's out of fashion,
And Wit's the only Drug in all the Nation.
Whilst Scenes, Machines, and empty Opera's reign,
And for the Pencil you the Pen disdain,
Nature is out of countenance, and gives place
To beastly Mimickry and vile Grimace.
A Woman now comes to reform the Stage,
Who once has stood the Brunt of this unthinking Age;
Yet should her Pen, her Beauty cannot fail;
But, oh! she vows she will not her Charms unvail,
Nor shall you know, harsh Men, at whom you rail.
Then how you censure this her Play beware,
Lest through the Poetess you wound the Fair:
But --
If you will go on to dawn good Sense in spite,
I Will be revenged on you to morrow night:
In this Side-box she will sit, I Will make it my Task,
Before you all, to strip her of her Mask;
Oh, how your Malice then you will repent,
And court those Favors which she shall not grant!
Her Face once seen, she cannot want Applause,
For Wit and Beauty both will plead her Cause.

HOW can you call me Friend, and thus conceal a Grief from me almost distracts
you? All Night you sighed and wept, and in your broken Slumbers started, and
cried, Oh that fatal Grove! Tell me, my Bebbemeah, I conjure thee, by all the
Love we ever vowed each other, make me a Sharer in your killing Sorrows


O, do not press my yielding Heart to tell the only Secret I ever hid from you;
alas, you will blame my weakness, and, instead of Pity, meet with your Contempt


Is It possible to think so meanly of Choufera? Have we not from our tender
Infancy loved far beyond the common Ties of Blood, in all our harmless Joys
been a partaker with each other, and can you think I would contemn you in
distress? Unkind Bebbemeah! I will not call you Friend; if you can meet with
one more faithful to you than Choufera has always been, I wish it you.


Stay, stay Choufera, would you for one Denial throw me from your Breast? O, do
not add that weight to what I already feel, I will most faithfully discharge my
Heart of that vast load of Grief which almost overwhelms me, but you must
promise not to chide me, I cannot bear your Anger


Pray do not fear it, I Will ease you of half the burden, by bearing it my self.


You know by what Engagements I am promised by my Father to Munzuffer, to which
with blind Obedience I gave confent, having only indifference for all Mankind;
but, O my dear Choufera, I am (...) longer Mistress of my Heart, for yesterday,
a fatal day I fear (...), I went to pass the tedious hours your Absence made me
think so in the Orange grove, where we so often have been, I seated my self by
the cool purling Stream, a Melancholy seized me, I knew not why, as a
Forerunner of my Woes to come, a gentle Slumber crept unawares upon me; but
long I had not slept, when I was waked by trampling of a Horse; I started up,
and the first Object presented to my view was a Youth of Heavenly form,
kneeling at my Feet


Go on, my Dearest.


It Is impossible to tell you my Surprise, and his appeared to be no less than
mine; If you're the Goddess of these Groves, said he, forgive the rashness of a
Stranger, who thus presumes to worship; but if of mortal race, I do conjure you
by all the Powers of Love, to tell me who you are. So soon as recovered my
Amazement, I told him I was Daughter to Pechai a private Gentleman, who lived
far from thence; and, that with my Father I was going hence next day: I see he
had Servants waiting at a distance, but I entreated him so earnestly not to
follow me, at last he promised me upon his Honor he would not; Go, go fair
Tyrant, cried he, and boast, whoever thou art, you have robbed a hapless Youth of
his dear Liberty, which all the Beauties of our East could never do before; but
be assured, wherever thou go, I Will find thee out, though in the remotest
corner of the World


And so you parted.


Oh, no, I had no power to leave him, with Passion he talked on, and moving
Eloquence enough to warm the Heart of cold Diana; Night drew her sable
Curtains, and forced us to a cruel separation, I fear for ever; the Soul parts
from the Body not with more reluctance than we did from each other; nor was I
so much Mistress of my self, but he, alas, perceived it. I could run on and
draw this Story to an endless length; at last I homeward went by several
turnings, that he might not discern which way I took. Forgive, my dear
Choufera, my prolixity, and pity my misfortune


I do with all my Soul; but why did you so carefully conceal the Knowledge who
you were


I durst not trust so powerful a Temptation to draw me from my Duty to my
Father


He ever promised not to force your inclination.


And I never to disobey his Will; his Goodness to me is the Rock on which I Am
lost, and I resolve to sacrifice my Happiness to his Pleasure


You never yet see Munzuffer, and it is possible might not have liked him, if
you had not seen this Stranger


All People speak of him in such high Characters, I fear I shall not find out
one Excuse that will seem just; he is young, has Wit and Sense, and beautiful to
admiration, good-humored, brave, and generous, what Objections can there be to
these Qualities, that will not discover the Prepossession of my Heart to be the
only Cause.


Compose your self, your Father's coming.


Persuade me not, I Will hear no more; Have I not promised her to Sennorat's Son,
the noble young Munzuffer


You promised her before to me, for my Son Cemat, who is as worthy of her.


You know she hates him, and I will never compel her to any thing she likes not.


Girls Humors are not to be consulted, they may like to day what yesterday
they hated, just as the Fancy takes 'em; if you thus fondly leave her to her
own choice, she may not perhaps like the Match you're so desirous of, but bring
a Son of her own seeking to call you Father, that you may blush to own


I know so well her Obedience, I fear it not; she has promised me to marry
Munzuffer, I know she will: What say you Bebbemeah, will you not keep your Word
with me


You may command me, Sir, to any thing, you never shall find me wanting in my
Duty


Where was your Duty when he commanded you to receive the Address of my Son?
But when a young Girl likes her Man, then, then it is Obedience


She knows not yet whether she does or no, she never saw him.


She hears he is a smug young fellow, a pretty Play-thing for a foolish Child,
had she understood Merit, she would found it in my Son


Since you will force me then to tell you so, though I left her to her self in
that Affair, I did not think him worthy of her


Nay, now you wrong him, basely wrong him, by the Gods you do; what if his Body
is not so well made as that of her young Paramour, he has a Soul as great as
was Alcides: Not worthy of her, that raw, young, foolish thing, who understands
no other Merit in a Man but a fine gay outside! it shall be tried who is the
worthiest man


You never were wanting to give her your ill word; come to my Closet Bebbemeah,
I must speak with you


Come hither, my Choufera, can you thus tamely hear thy Brother injured, and
not thirst to be revenged on that proud Girl


He is not the first man has been denied in an amorous Suit; it is impossible
to force an inclination where it is not natural, nor can I think him injured by
it


Not injured! base, base degenerate Choufera! Oh! I shall burst with Rage;
hence, from my sight. Cemat; thus to have all my Hopes blown into Air, and
frustrated by a young beardless Boy, I am all Fury: Who waits there? bid my Son
come to me here, if he has Spirit, as I believe he has, it shall be tried what
he durst do to right himself and me. Cemat, that Bebbemeah is snatched from
your Arms, and given to another


Let her be whose she will, I care not, were but her Fortune mine.


That Is right, my Son, but there is no way to compass that without the Woman too.


Do but direct me what you would have me do, I have a Hand and Heart I dare employ
in any gainful mischief


O, thou reviv'st my almost-dying Hopes, thou were born to be thy Mother's only
Blessing: This Munzuffer, this happy Rival comes, he hourly is expected, you
want no Friends to serve you on such occasions, way-lay him in the Wood through
which you know he passes, and spoil his fine Addresses; you understand me, do
it, and leave the rest unto thy Mother's Care


What, murder him, you mean; conclude it done, you never shall see him here.


Success attend, I Will leave thee to contrive it.


Cemat! that, that is the Saint you worship: What! love thy own Sister! why,
where is the harm? she is a handsome young sprightly Wench, and made to be
enjoyed, and why not by her Brother? Jupiter lie with his Sister? Ah, but he is
a God, they say, and may do what he pleases, without being accountable to
Mortals; oh, for his Shower of Gold, the most powerful shape he ever assumed,
that I might wanton in my Danae's Arms. Two pretty Undertakings I Am upon,
that is the Truth on it, Murder and Incest,

I Will murder him, his Mistress to enjoy,
Ravish my Sister, if the Fool is coy,
And set the World on fire ever I will lose one Joy.

Stay and take fresh Intelligence, here is a Messenger just arrived from
Sennorat


From Sennorat, say you? conduct him in.


Now, my Choufera, I am lost indeed; this Message comes to bring the tidings of
his approach


You know not that, have Patience till you see the result.


There Is some unwelcome News, do you observe him?


I do, and hope the Gods, in pity to me, have given some interruption to his
coming


My Service to your Lord, tell him, I will suddenly return an Answer by a
Servant of my own. Sennorat would not fool me in this Concern; he is a Man of
that nice Honor, I think he would not do it: Here Bebbemeah, peruse that
Letter, it is you are most concerned.








Sure Heaven is not propitious to this Match, not one kind Star has smiled upon
it yet, I Will think on it more; What say you, Bebbemeah, art thou contented to
be thus neglected, and lose a rich young Husband


You are to me a Husband, Father, all things; whilst I enjoy the Blessing of
your Life, I never shall think my self unhappy


My Care shall always be for your Advantage, I Will go and answer Sennorat's
Letter.


Kind Heaven has heard my Prayers, and I Am released of half my Cares already.
Choufera; see what a world of Grief these Letters have removed from Bebbemeah's
Heart


It Is with a Confusion great as my Affliction that I acquaint you with the
disappointment of my Hopes; my rebellious Son, by whom I was to gain the Honor
of your Alliance, has left me without giving further Reasons for it than what
he inserts in the Note I have enclosed, sent you, which was delivered to me
after his flight: Judge of my Trouble, and consider his Folly as the rashness
of an unadvised young Man, who will, I hope, quickly see his Error, and return
to his Duty

SENNORAT.


Never, I hope; proceed, my Dear, to the other.


I have always been unworthy of the Care you took of my Happiness, but much
more since the Affairs of my Heart are changed, which renders me incapable of
the Honor was intended me in the fair Bebbemeah, who has too much Merit only
to share a Heart; mine is prepossessed by an Accident, as unforeseen by me as
unwelcome to you: I fly your Anger, not being able to obey you, and I beg you,
with as much Compassion as your Resentment will permit, to consider it is a
Passion not to be resisted, though I have made my utmost Efforts to overcome it,
it is the only Fault I have committed, who in all other things am your dutiful
Son

MVNZVFFER.


It Is true, you're freed from the Apprehensions of marrying one you love not,
but see not how 'twill compass him you love; do not you now repent your owning
your Name and Quality


Since Fortune is so kind, I Will hope the best,
Rejoice at this, and trust her with the rest.

I Am almost weary with riding these few miles; what a vast Load's the Body when
the Soul's oppressed! At yonder stately Pagode there lives a learned Tallapoy,
profoundly read in Art and Nature's Secrets, he may inform me what my Stars
design, and teach my wandering steps to find out what I Am in search of; Do you
know him, Rulup


Know him, yes Sir, I have heard enough of him to tremble at his very Name;
why, he is the Devil incarnate, would you go to the Devil, Sir, for a Woman


Away, you Fool! he is a mighty Prophet, Austere of Life, a Favorite of the
holy Gods, can their Decrees foretell, and what is writ in the dark Book of
Fate; go tell him I beg to speak with him, and wait his coming here


O S^r! no sooner conjure, but you know who is in the Circle. Yonder he comes, I
beseech you let me go, I Am not holy enough for his company; besides, Sir, you
may have Secrets to discourse on are not fit a poor Serving-man should hear.


Stay sirrah, I charge you, I may perhaps have use of you.


Use! I Am not fit for the use of any living Creature at this time, but if I
must stay, I Will secure my self as well as I can; I believe, for all his
holiness, he seldom looks up to Heaven


Hail reverend Father, pitiful and good, vouchsafe to tell the Destiny of him
whom Love has made unhappy


I will, I Am therefore hither sent by the great Gods, to whom thy Virtues are
most dear; descend thou airy Spirit, thou that of Lovers take the greatest
care, and tell this Lovesick Youth the utmost he would know.


YOU fly from what you seek, deny what you implore;
Return, thy Father's Grief to cheer,
Tell him thy Love, and do not fear,
It Is he thy Doubts can clear,
And to thy longing Wish thy Mistress will restore.
The hellish fatal Sisters thy senses will beguile,
Thy envied Joys they will debar,
And cause a deadly mortal Jar,
Of Jealousy beware,
Thy Sight too will delude thee, and Innocence exile.
The Parricide, who woo's thee to her lewd Bed, detest;
For Heaven will at last agree
To crown thy constant Loyalty,
And happy thou shall be;
Take warning, gentle Youth, and be for ever blessed.
Thanks, holy Father, for this kind Admonition.


Be careful, noble Munzuffer, there is a dreadful Fate hangs over your Head, be
virtuous, and be happy.


Some Power above direct me what to do, and steer my Actions to your Heavenly
Will. Come down, you Coward, do you not see he is gone?


No indeed, not I, my Eyes have been close shut, and my Ears stopped, I would
not countenance their diabolical Music by my attention; besides, I have heard
of some fine singing things that draw their list'ners to follow them whether
they will or no, perhaps she might be one of them


Sirens you mean.


I know not what you call them, but I heard a Story of a great Man that tied
himself to the Mast, for fear of leaping into the Sea after them


A very famous Story indeed, Ulysses, was it not?


I think he had some such cramp Name; but be it what it will, his Example, for
ought I know, has saved me from breaking my neck


Come down you Sot.


As soon as I can get loose.


Go, bring the Horses, I Will go back again, what think you of that?





Hold your profane Tongue Sirrah, and do as I command.


Most willingly.


Eastern Kingdoms.





TO appease my angry Father I will go,
Who if my Mistress finds, will more bestow
Than all his Wealth can give me here below.

NAY, further yet; it is a Secret of that great importance, the remotest corner
of this mighty Wood is hardly private enough


I Am sure we have no overhearers in this place, and I Am so weary I can go no
further





You see it is an unfrequented Path by the high Grass, I do believe no human
Ear can reach us


Then this it is: Sister, I love you, nay, start not, more than a Brother
should, and must enjoy you


Good Heavens! what mean you Brother, you are not sure in earnest?


Why not in earnest? Is it such a Wonder to love a pretty Woman?


I Am sure you jest, and tell me so to fright me.


If any Crime there be, it is you're the cause; your Honor is secure with me:
Come, come, my dear Choufera, let us be free, I Will give you a strong Proof how
much I love you.


Stand off, foul Monster; what villainous intentions thou art bent upon,
profane thy own Blood, ravish thy Sister! Think, think Cemat, upon the horrid
Deed


I did not bring you here to rail, and am resolved, if you will not consent, to
force you


I Will rend the Skies with shrieks, and move some pitying God, a Friend to
Chastity, to come to my assistance; and see, my Prayers are heard.


Ha! is she gone? she shall not escape me so, I soon shall overtake her.

Let the Coach go softly up the Hill, it is a cool pleasant Morning, we will walk
and overtake it: Disperse that Cloud upon thy Brow Munzuffer, and look as if
thou were to see thy fair lost Mistress: Have not I promised I will put no
Force upon thy Heart? she may be like the Picture which you showed me, and
therefore you may love her


I wish I may, Sir, to oblige the kindest Father ever Son was blessed with.





Ha! a Woman's Voice, it sounded this way; Art to gone? The Youth is too nimble
for me.


But I Will not stay behind.


Whoever they be, curse on 'em, for coming just the very minute, a little
longer, and I had enjoyed my Ends, and then she would have kept the Secret for
her own sake. But this is no place to stay in, I Will get home before her, and if
the silly Slut does tell her Tale, why I Will forswear it.


I Am sorry the Villain 'scap'd us.


Banish your fears, Madam, you are secure, we will see you safely home, where ever
it be


How shall I return my Thanks to Heaven and you for this deliverance?

Oh Bebbemeah! a Fate like thine I mourn,
A Stranger love, and for one I know not, burn.

Compose your Thoughts, fair Lady, and tell us where it is we shall wait on you.


Since to the mighty Obligation I stand indebted for, you yet will add a fresh
one, which I dare not refuse, for fear again of that bold Ravisher from whom
you rescued me; on yonder Hill, at that great House, is where I live


At Pechai's! it is thither we are going.


Bebbemeah.


I beg you would leave me in the Orange-grove, at the entrance to the Park, and to
conceal the meeting me in this unlucky place, I have some Reasons for it are
fit you should not know at present


Fear it not Lady, we will do as you desire.





Conduct the Lady to the Coach, Munzuffer.


Munzuffer! this is Bebbemeah's fugitive Lover returned; oh, if she see him
with my Eyes, what will become of poor unhappy Choufera?


Munzuffer returned to his Father, say you! art to sure on it?


Yes, Sir, I see him; I had just delivered your Letter to Sennorat, who sighed
and almost wept, and cried, Ungracious Boy! thou have broke thy Father's Heart;
but strait a general Joy ran through the House, and nothing but Murzuffer's
Name repeated: He asked in haste, distrustful of his Joy, what meant those
Acclamations; before he could be answered, his Son was at his Feet, imploring
his Forgiveness, which he soon obtained: He bid me say, he would send Munzuffer to
beg your Mediation to his injured Mistress, and come himself to obtain from
fair Bebbemeah a Pardon for his Son: I just arrived with these happy tidings,
they will not be long after me. This Letter, Sir, he charged me with to you,
and this to fair Bebbemeah


Now, my Bebbemeah, prepare to receive the noble young Munzuffer.





I cannot now but join with her, I think her Request is just.


Madam* I know from whence your Advice proceeds. Rise my Child, remember what I
always promised you, be satisfied till you see him


O, where is my Choufera, that I may ease my overcharged Heart into her
friendly Bosom.


My Lord, Sennorat is arrived.


Conduct him in; Callapia, pray withdraw for a few minutes.


Welcome, most noble Sennorat, and you, brave Youth.


I Am come, my Lord, with my offending Son, to entreat a Pardon for him.





Most certainly; know you this Picture?


I do: Who waits there?





Ha! what do I see! by all the Powers of Love, the very very same; how shall I
hide my Transports


Choufera, the lovely charming Stranger I see in the Orange grove; I am all
Joys, O help me to conceal 'em


Choufera!


Munzuffer, take her to your Wishes, I Am not so much a stranger to both your
Hearts, to doubt the Present is not acceptable




With all my Heart, Lovers Discourses are not for others Ears.


They seem acquainted already, sure they before have seen each other; O, he is a
lovely sweet young Gentleman.


Now, now my Joys are full, divinest Bebbemeah; but what a world of Grief you
would have spared me, had you not used another's Name


I Would Reasons for it, my Lord, which, when convenient, you shall know.


Fly, fly you tardy hours, to bring about the time that blessed Munzuffer may
call the matchless Bebbemeah his


My Lord, I have a doubt I do believe you can resolve; how came my Lord
Sennorat and my Father to know our meeting in the Grove


It was the happiest minute of my Life, I told him of it; when most unkindly
you had left me alone to my Despair, I homeward went full of the Idea of your
charming self; next Morning 'twas designed by my Father, for all things were in
a readiness to wait on Bebbemeah, I found out many Excuses to put it off a
little longer, but none were of force enough to prevail: I rose e're break of
Day, and only with one of my Grooms, a simple honest fellow, I left my Father's
House, never to see it more till I had at least found out who 'twas had robbed
me of my Liberty: By what strange means I was sent back to my Father, I Will take
another time to tell: But after I had gained his Pardon for my Disobedience, I
told him my Adventure in the Grove, and showed him this Picture, which there
you dropped


I never knew till now which way I lost it, nor can well remember for what
reason I should have it about me


He seemed o'erjoy'd, embraced, and said I should but only see, and if your
Beauty could not efface that of my Fair unknown, he would not press me to it,
and help himself to find my Charmer out. He asked me several Questions, and if
I thought my Love was not displeasing to her; Pardon me, lovely Mistress, for I
told him, by what I could perceive in the small Conversation we had together,
I Would made some small impression on your Heart


That was the Purport of the Letter, I suppose, my Father was so pleased at. I
find they design to surprise us both





My dearest Bebbem. will you not give me leave to call you so, and hope a
little Inclination, as well as Duty, gives you to Munzuffer


It Is time enough, my Lord, for such Confessions.


Bebbemeah, you will surfeit your new Lover with too much forwardness; retire,
I Will keep him company


Choufera, we must obey.





This is a Freedom, Sir, not usual in our Country, to give young People leave
to talk together before they are married; it is her Father's blind Indulgence to
her, who suffers her in every thing to follow her own Humor, which always led
her to love Men's company; she is of an amorous Complexion


That is a rigorous and cruel Custom, all People ought to please themselves in
such a great concern as Marriage is


And do you like her, Sir?


I love her more than Life, or all things else on Earth.


I Am sorry for it, so pretty a Gentleman deserves a better Fortune.


I want nothing, Madam, in having her, but Merit to deserve her; she is
beautiful to adoration, and virtuous, what can the blessed Munzuffer wish for
more


The Levity you see her guilty of is no great sign of that.


It was not only by her Father's Permission, but Command, she gave me leave to
tell her that I loved her


You have seen her, Sir, before, where you had opportunity enough to tell her
often so


We then were Strangers to each other, and 'twas by accident we met in the
Orange-grove


A likely matter to meet in such a place by accident.


I Would lost my Company a hunting, and went to repose my self under the cool
shade, not knowing she was there, nor any else; it is very easy to give credit
to me, if you consider why I refused to marry Bebbemeah, whilst I went in
search of her, far from knowing I fled from the Happiness I was seeking





That I cannot believe, I Am sati^fied she loves me, and no one else; I saw it
by an hundred Signs at the very time I mention





There is no danger, Madam, of that trial of my Faith, it needs no serious
Answer.


Oh stay, too lovely Stranger, and take the soft Confession of my Soul; it is I
my self that love thee, charming Youth, and here I swear to die, if you refuse
me yours


Bebbemeah, and then I fear her not.


Why do you pause, Sir? Is it so hard a thing to love again where you are best
beloved


Pardon me, Madam, if I am surpised; I am not worthy of the least part of your
Affection, you have a noble Husband, who best deserves it all, I would not rob
him of his just share to be the happy man my self


Suppose I were a Widow, would you then love me and quit my hated Rival?





If that be all, the Objection I will soon remove, this feeble doting Husband
shall not live to bar me of my Bliss, and I doubt not but the Wealth I have
unknown, and what I add by Bebbemeah's Ruin, which I will contrive to make her
Fortune mine, will charm his wavering Heart. Cemat, you are come the very
minute I was wishing for thee





I charge thee touch him not; no, no Cemat, I have another Game to play, in
which you must assist





Thou mind'st me not, what ailst' Cemat?


I do, Madam, most heedfully; pray go on, and tell me what it is you would have me
do


A matter which you with greatest ease may compass, a Dose of Poison for my
Husband.


I Am only vexed to be outdone in Wickedness; you have it, (...) me but the
reason for it


It is for thy advantage and my happiness this wise Munzuffer, this wondrous
Young Man, love mes Cemat, and would marry me, were Pechai but removed out of
the way, and then, without control, thou may have Bebbemeah





It must be so, or I shall have Munzuffer snatched from me; I Will lose no time,
but instantly about it.

This honest old virtuous Fool I Have always been in fear of, I Am glad he is so
disposed; like the fierce Ranger of the Libian Deserts, I now will reign
without control in my Pleasures; I am my Mothers Son I dare to swear, but sure
Choufera's no Child of hers, Virtue, Modesty, and Goodness, thank Pluto, were
never Attributes of our Family: I must take new measures with this skittish
Girl, pretend Penitence, and beg her Pardon, I shall never else get another
opportunity, she so carefully aviods me; I see her coming, I Will abscond till I
have secured her to hear me speak.


Where shall I go to give my Sorrows vent, and ease my poor sunk Heart, oppressed
with Grief and Sadness? I have no Friend to pour out my Complaints to: O happy
Bebbemeah, happy lucky Sister! I Will not disturb thy Joys with the unfortunate
Story of my Woes, I know so well thou love Choufera, thou would pity her more
than a Rival ought





Take back, good Gods, the hated Life you lent, let me not live to a long Age
of endless Misery: What a false Notion is it, that no one loves, but hopes!
alas, I have not one to save me, falling into the deep Abyss of horrid dark
Despair: Unhappy Maid! thou can have no Relief from any thing but Death


Choufera of Death? Tell me, my dearest Sister, who has wronged thee, thy
Brother wears a Sword will right thy Injuries





I have a Secret, Madam, of yours in keeping, you would not be well pleased I
should discover: you love Munzuffer, Choufera; nay, blush not, it is no Crime


Still, still unlucky in all I say or do?


Choufera, say not that you have no Friend, you shall always find a true one of
your Brother; distrust me not, I would redeem the Injuries I intended thee with
the last drop of all my Blood; I come to ask your Pardon for my rash Attempt,
which thus I humbly beg,


Rise Cemat, I do forgive you, ask it of Heaven, 'twas a most foul Attempt, and
not a common Sin





O Cemat, thou know the only Secret of my Life, keep it I charge thee, as
you would one that would betray thy Liberty or Life


My Life is but a Trifle, I would give that to expiate my Offense; rely on me,
and if I can without a Crime make Munzuffer yours, it shall be done


O no, I would not injure Bebbemeah's Happiness to gain my own; she loved him
with a boundless Passion before I saw him, he is her Due* my Fate's
unalterable, I wish for nothing but a Grave to hide my Sorrows in.


Munzuffer, that will be one way to get my self into her good Opinion, which I
must be possessed of to get her in my power


Throw me in Ice, and cover me with Snow, to cool this raging Fever in my
Bowels, I Am all in flames, I burn, I burn; convey me to the River Menam, where
I may quench my most immoderate thirst


Run for Physicians, let no Art be spared to save my dearest Husband's precious
Life: O most unfortunate Callapia! I Will not outlive my dearest Lord, but perish
with his Ashes


A Chill now runs through all my Veins, Agues and Fevers successively by turns
torture my perishing Entrails, O lay me, lay me in the hot Beams of the most
scorching Sun, or plunge me in the Streams of boiling Phlegeton. I Am now again
on fire; Sennorat, Munzuffer, Wife, Daughter, all, all help to quench me. I
feel a Numbness seize on all my Limbs, and Death steal gently on me; I am now
at ease


O most unhappy day of all my Life! my dearest tenderest Father, give me your
Blessing e're your Soul departs


Thou have it, Child: My Lord Sennorat, take her to your Care, and when my
Funeral Obsequies are over, give her to Munzuffer; farewell, a long farewell to
all.


O stay and take me with you: He Is gone, he is gone, and I will follow him.


Look to the Lady there, bow her, and give her Air; dry up thy Tears,
Bebbemeah, I Will be a Father to thee; we must submit to the Decrees of Fate, do
not afflict thy self for what thy Tears can never bring thee back





Carry her to her Apartment -- True Grief is seldom thus outrageous: Come
Bebbemeah, thou art my Charge


Such Grief as mine, admits no lookers on; pray, Sir, give me leave to retire
to my Chamber


I must not leave you to such Grief, fair Mourner, I Will wait on you.


So, he is safe enough; O excellent Woman! fit only to be the Mother of Cemat!


Hist, Cemat, come back, Pechai's dead, do know it?


I do, I stood concealed and see your Grief, I almost thought it real, you
counterfeited rarely


Now Cemat, I will pretend such an unbounded Grief, that like our Indian Wives,
who burn themselves in the Pile which consumes their Husbands Bodies, so I will
feign to do, 'twill take off suspicion


You may safely venture to attempt it, you know it is not the Custom of our
happier Siameses, and 'twill not be permitted you


But you however shall to Choufera, and tell her my intention, and beg her to
be earnest with Sennorat to prevent it


You need not doubt, Choufera will be sure to do her part, her love to you will
prompt her quickly to undertake it as soon as I have told her; I Will instantly
about it.

With Caution I must act, I have a mighty Game to play before Munzuffer will be
mine; if Bebbemeah dies, her Fortune comes to me by Contract of my Marriage
with Pechai; but let her live for my Cemat, I have enough, I hope, to dazzle the
young Eyes of my dear lovely Charmer, and move his Father to consider my
Fortune, in value far exceeding hers, to be the better Match for his brave Son:
I had a Prince, when I was young, who was my private Lover, from whose vast
Bounty I raised a most invaluable Treasure, which I most carefully concealed
from Pechai's Knowledge, and likewise my first Husband, in whose days it was;
this I will show to Sennorat, and his most charming Son: But something I must
do with Bebbemeah, to ruin her in the good Opinion of both the Son and the
Father, but I will try all Arts to win him first by fair and gentle means:
They Are both coming this way, now for my Handkercher and Tears again


I had just sent for you, my Lord, to let you know my Resolution's fixed to
expire in the Pile whose flames are to consume the dear dead Body of my
much-loved Lord


I cannot but commend the Piety to your departed Husband, but it is not a Custom
here that will be countenanced, therefore you must forbear the Thoughts, and
live to be a Comfort to your Children


Alas! what is Life to me now he is gone, the only Comfort of it? I have that to
leave my Son and Daughter, beside the Provision already made most largely, will
provide for them, and make 'em always happy, which I Will ent^^st you with, to
see it equally disposed to both: Draw in that Chest.


Prodigious! this is a mass would enrich an Emperor! whence came this, Madam?


'Twas given to my Father by our late King of Siam, for a private Service he
did him, who left it all to me


If you resolve to die, I will with Justice see your Will performed; Choufera I
will take into my Care, your Son's a Man, I hear, and will not like a Guardian


I beg, my Lord, you would see the Rites prepared, I have a greater business takes
up all my Thoughts.


I come, my Lord, with my afflicted Sister, to beg you would save her Mother from
the hard Death we hear she'as doomed her self


I do design, fair Ladies, to prevent it, but she is so bent upon it, I fear
there is no prevailing with her to lay the Thoughts aside; let her, to satisfy
her Melancholy Humor, appear in all the solemn Pomp used on such occasions,
and in the sight of all the lookers on I Will interpose and save her


May you be ever blessed in all you wish, for this kind Pity.


This I have overheard most luckily; thus far Success has crowned my Designs.

The Brave that dare may always happy be,
Laugh at the Fates, and baffle Destiny.

HEnce, you infernal Spirits, come not near
This sacred Pile, let those pure Ashes rest:
His spotless Soul to the great God's most dear
Ascend through these bright Flames up to the Blessed.

O Vespa! place this Vrn safe from the reach
Of the black Serpent of the House of Smoke:
Let his most pious Life Example teach,
The God of thousand Gods we thus invoke.

Great Tanagoopoo, hear our Prayer,
These Ashes take into thy Care;
Keep the foul Dragon in his Den,
The Enemy of Gods and Men.

Thou that to Virgin-Prayers an Ear do lend,
Sacred Amida, Goddess of our Vow,
To thy chaste Care these Ashes we commend,
Thy Favor to our just Request allow.

To Paradise his holy Soul convey,
What happy Spirits on the Good do wait,
Where the bright Sun makes an eternal Day,
Blessed for ever from the reach of Fate.

Ascend, ye Flames, up to the Skies,
We with it send our Prayers and Cries:
Great Tanagoopoo bow thine Ear,
Vouchsafe our Prayers and Tears to hear.



O save her, save her from the raging Flames.


Callapia, you have showed your Kindness to your Husband surpassing far the
common Love of Wives, I must not let you die


Will you not let me go to Paradise, most barbarous Man!


Conduct her to her Chamber, and there let us labor all to give her quiet.


Ha, ha, ha, you need not take such care of her, she has outdone the very
Original of Dissimulation, I could even hug my self to see our thriving Plots
go on so fast: Are they coming? They must not see me.


She Is so immoderate in her Grief, all Reasoning is in vain.


A little time will wear it off, now, Sir, I beg you to proceed to solemnize
our Marriage, I have some boding Thoughts I cannot overcome, which makes me
fear my Bebbemeah will be snatched away


That cannot be, my Son, you know she is at my disposal, but to disperse thy
Fears, this very night she shall be yours, beyond the reach of Fortune to take
her from you





Shine, shine my Stars, and Hymen light his Torch, and thou great Goddess that
attends on Marriage Rites, bless our mutual loves. Bebbemeah! lovely Mistress,
say, will thou not give thy wondrous Beauty up to blessed Munzuffer's Longings?
This very night gives Bebbemeah to me, and nothing waits to crown my Joys but
thy Consent


It is too soon, my Lord, to talk of Joys, my dearest Father's Ashes yet are
warm; delay it longer, it is indeed too soon


You know it was your Father's dying word, and though I may command you to it, I
only will entreat; there is danger in Delays, Munzuffer, do not leave her till
you have gained the point, whilst I take care that nothing else be wanting to
complete it.


Bebbemeah! can you so soon forget your tender loving Father, to talk of
Marriage? the Funeral Pile is hardly yet extinguished; withdraw, I Will talk to
your Lover about it

Now all my Fears return. Munzuffer, when you the proffer of my Love refused,
it was because I was another's Right? what hinders now to take me to your Arms
instead of Bebbemeah? that vast Wealth I showed you shall be yours, take it all
and me unto your Bosom


It Is you forget the Grief so lately showed for your dear Husband's death, and,
I must tell you, it is Bebbemeah wholly has my Heart, her Image there so deeply
is impressed, nothing can blot it out, do not for pity interrupt my Joys, could I
love another, it should be you


What are thy Joys to me, if I must be unhappy? Consider, Munzuffer, what thou
do refuse; I sue thee for thy Love, she but obeys her Father; besides, she
long since was contracted to my Son, her broken Vows will pull down Vengeance
from the Gods upon her self and you


Forbid it Heaven, I love her with that Passion, I Will through all Obstacles
whatever they be, without her I am ruined


And with her too, fond Youth, she is not the virtuous modest thing you take her
for, she is lewd as Hell, there is scarce a Slave or Groom in all her Father's
House but has enjoyed her; you will find it so when it is too late to help it


It cannot be, I Am sure you wrong her Virtue; I see you are a Counterfeit all
over, thy Griefs just now were not to be repaired, and now you are suing for
another Husband, would you had died before you troubled thus the Quiet of my
Soul


I would I had indeed, since you can be so cruel to her who tells you of the
danger that you may escape; 'twas only for your sake that I did live, O throw
this Prostitute from thy generous Heart, and take me in her room.


Stand off Witch, Sorceress, I hate thee most implacably;


Munzuffer! is this the Recompense you give my Love? I Will take my self for ever
from your sight, and weep, like Niobe, into a Marble Statue, to leave a lasting
Monument of thy unmanly Cruelty.


Leave me not, I charge you, come back and tell me.
Yet what I know not.

You Would have me unsay what I told you of Bebbemeah; is it not so, my Lord?


Callapia, see, at your Feet Munzuffer falls, unasked I do forgive you, ease
but my tortured Mind, and say she is innocent


I Will say so if you please, or any thing you would have me.


Bebbemeah, pardon my jealous Thoughts.


How soon you would cheat your self in what you wish! consider what I said, and
think if it be a just occasion of this mighty Joy


Ha, what say you? Did you not tell me she is innocent of those black Crimes
you charged her with in Passion


I told you I would say what you would have me, did that include her guiltless?
Worthy Munzuffer, believe e're it is too late her Shame and thine, if you join
Wedlock with this infamous Creature


To what a Labyrinth am I hurried on! I Will hear no more, I Am sure you wrong
her, yet I am all distraction.


Go Fool, I think I have stung thee to some purpose, I have not done with thee:
Done, did I say? I yet have scarce begun: if all the Stratagems and Art that
Woman ever practiced can compass him, I yet will make him mine. Come in, Cemat,
Bebbemeah's, this Idol of his Soul's destruction, he has downright refused my
Love


What, break his Promise to you! his Life shall make you satisfaction.


No, my Cemat, then I lose all my Hopes; I Have raised his thoughts to doubts of
her already, which I Will convince him of to be all Truth, by having a black
Slave found with her on the Bed, himself shall see it, 'twill ruin her for
ever in his Opinion, and cause a Breath, which never shall be healed, if I can
help it


It looks with a good Face, if you can bring it well about.


it, and give it to one of her own Slaves, no matter which, 'twill cause
immediate Sleep as sound as Death, I Will take the same care of Bebbemeah, when
you have done convey him to her Apartment, and leave me to the rest

Your Duty in your quick dispatch be known;
This hour, kind Fate, and then he is sure my own.

It is a Calumny thrown on her, believe it not, my Son, upon my life you will find
it so; however we will delay the Marriage for some time, and keep the strictest
watch on all her Actions; Callapia may have some Design in it, though what I know
not





I never liked Callapia, she is a subtle Woman; I look upon the information
with less concern, because it came from her; perhaps she has a mind to thee her
self: Ha, you blush! nay, then it is so indeed, the Wealth she showed thee has
seduced thy Heart from Bebbemeah, which makes you so easily entertain an ill
Opinion of her


Sir, your Reproaches are too severe, and most unjust, I love fair Bebbemeah
above my Life or Liberty, I Would rather live a wandering Fugitive, by all but her
forsaken than sit on the bright Throne of our great Siam's King without her:
Callapia, Sir, cannot by any means seduce my faithful Heart, tho I must own she
has endeavored it


Then banish all thy Doubts, and take thy Bebbemeah to thy Bosom, it is all
Design, where is thy Sense, that thou do not perceive it


I would most willingly believe it so, but sure she could not be so very wicked
without some Cause


Is not that Cause enough? Go, go, and find thy Bebbemeah out, a sight of her
will quite dispel thy Fears


Callapia speak with me! tell her I Will wait on her.


Pechai's death have had a suspicion of his being poisoned, he died with all
the Signs, and much I fear Callapia's Hand was in it, I must examine when first
her Love begun to Munzuffer, that might be the cause of his untimely End, and
all her Grief dissembled to palliate her Crime; the Resolution too of burning
might be the same, for well she knew she should be saved: Here comes her
Daughter, for once I Will listen, I may discover something by it.


I am denied admittance to Bebbemeah's Chamber, what is the meaning often I know
not, but much I fear some foul Play's designed. My Mother sent for her to come
to her Apartment: Cemat too I met in haste going to Callapia, I would have
spoke to him, but could not make him stay, such was his haste: And just now I
see Munzuffer enter my Mother's Lodgings; there must be something in it, good
Heavens protect her, I know my Mother always hated her


This is as I would have it; if they are all together, they will quickly come to
clearing the business; I hope she does repent of what she said, and gives this
meeting to reconcile the matter: Choufera may perhaps interrupt 'em, I Will
divert her some other way. Choufera, I have some business, pray let me talk
with you


I fear he knows I love his charming Son.


I sent for you, Munzuffer, to let you know your Bebbemeah, whom you are so fond
of, has given up her right in you to me, and says she loves you not, nor ever
did, and is resolved to give her self to my Son Cemat: Now, Munzuffer, see who
loves you best, and be not still ungrateful


How can you say you love me, Madam, and find so many ways to torture me? I Am
sure it is false, she did confess to me her self she loved me


She told you so indeed she said, but 'twas to please her Father, she now is
Mistress of her self, and will not be imposed on in her Choice; she added
likewise, if you distrusted what I said, she would tell you so her self


If she does that, I Will never trouble her again; I shall not think her worth
the asking for


I Will lead you to her Chamber, if she is there, you will be convinced that what I
say is true.


Ha! what do I see! sure it is Delusion all, I dare not trust my sight; good
Gods, can that be Bebbemeah


Infamous Girl! this was an unexpected sight, but now, I hope, you are
convinced of my Truth and her Disloyalty.





Lock there, lascivious Girl, and see by me your black Amorat slain.


Mine! Heavens, what do you mean? this is some Plot upon my Honor: say,
Munzuffer, sure you will tell me truth, how came all this to pass? how came I
here, you, and Callapia, and that poor wretch who lies weltring in his Blood





Sure it is no wonder, Madam, to find you in your own Apartment, but to be found
in the Embraces of a poor Slave, who you must court to satisfy your Lust,
think, think on that, false Bebbemeah


How Munzuffer! do you conspire against me too? you cannot sure believe so foul
a thought of me





O Bebbemeah! is it possible that heavenly Form, surprising Fair, should hide
so black a Soul? had the great Rulers of the enameled Sky descended and told me
this, I would not have believed 'em; but with my own Eyes wide open, to thy
shame, to view thy lustful Sin, there is not one bare Hope left me, that I
might be deceived. Adieu.


O stay and hear me speak; I am ruined and betrayed, by whom or by what means I
cannot tell; how that Wretch came here, by all the sacred Powers, I know not,
I Am truly innocent, my dear Munzuffer, believe me so, or I am lost for ever


Did not I see your fair white Arms lay twined about that sooty fellow's Neck,
and all that melting lovely Body in his black lustful Arms? is this to be
forgiven by a young Lover, who almost died each day for the enjoyment of that
Treasure a poor despised Slave has robbed thee of


I do not ask Forgiveness Munzuffer, I have not committed any Crime that needs
it


O monstrous! not a Crime to be found in the Arms of a black loathsome Slave!


This barbarous Usage to me you will repent, Heaven, who of Innocence take care,
will clear the wrong you do my Virtue; you cannot entertain, I Am sure, so vile
a Thought of your once-lov'd Bebbemeah: You shall not leave me till you believe
me,


Why would you keep me with you, Madam, you have given your Interest up in me to
be another's Right


I give my Interest up! what is it you mean? I see the Powers of Hell are all
conspired to ruin Bebbemeah; my dear-lov'd Lord, hear and believe my Vows: May
never the Sun's all-cheering Light appear to my benighted Eyes, but an eternal
Darkness always cover me; may this poor Body, which you once did love, be the
living Prey of Lions, Bears, or Tigers; and all the Hopes I ever had for
Happiness, prove endless Curses to me, if ever my Heart, so much as in one
Thought, strayed from you since first you took the sole possession there. And
for this horrid Injury you do my spotless Fame, may I unpitied die, loathed and
abhorred by all, and leave an everlasting Scandal on my Name to all succeeding
Ages, if ever a Deed so foul was known to the chaste Soul of the much-wrong'd
Bebbemeah


My Heart pleads strongly, and I would believe thee, but it is impossible, did
not I see thy Falsehood my self; I Will hear no more, farewell for ever.


You must, you shall believe me, I will not let you go till I have quite drove
out this black Suspicion from your noble Soul. Bebbemeah, to put the World in
mind that once there was such an unhappy Maid. Callapia showed has corrupted
him, and this a Trick of both for a Pretense to break our Marriage off:
ungenerous man! was it not Injustice enough to break thy Vows, but sacrifice my
Fame to thy Perfidiousness? cursed, cursed Gold, what mighty Evil is it that
thou have not done


Ha, Bebbemeah! my dearest Sister, why in this posture, and why that Face and
Voice of Sorrow?


No, Choufera, let me lie on this cold Bed, like Byblis, I would weep my self
into a streaming Fountain: O Sister, could you think it! I Am betrayed by thy
false Mother and falser base Munzuffer; they found me here (by what means they
best can tell, I Am sure I cannot) in that murdered Monster's Arms; can you,
Choufera, believe me such a Prostitute? if you forsake me too, I am abandoned
by all the World


No, Bebbemeah, I never will forsake thee, but like a Friend indeed, partake of
all thy wretched Fortune: Treacherous Man! would he not hear thee plead thy
Innocence


He gave no credit to all that I could say; no, no, thy Mother, by a Wealth she
has unknown to thee, has charmed his avaricious Mind, and snatched his Heart
from me


Stay not in this most unlucky place, poor ruined Bebbemeah, fly to some
private corner of the World, where we will end our days together, and never be
heard of more





I never can consent to leave thee in such Misery, I Will follow and share thy
mighty Sorrow, it never shall be said Choufera forsakes her Bebbemeah when most
she has need of Comfort


Or will I ever involve my dearest Friend in my unheard of Woes.


O Madam! fly from this fatal place; I just now heard designs are laid against
your dearest Life; Callapia's Woman has undertaken, by her persuasion, to
poison you, which she consented to, to hinder employing some one else that
might perform her devilish Commands; she came and told me of it, to give you
timely Warning


Most wicked Woman! I will not call thee Mother.


Yet I would not so tamely die, and leave an everlasting Blot upon my Name;
What shall I do, Sardea, or whither shall I go


Close by the Menam's side, on Levo's Plain, there is a House the People
whereof I know very well, there you may be concealed till we can find a Vessel
to transport us further


Till then I Will here remain, and give you daily information of all that passes;
but go no further I charge thee, Bebbemeah, without Choufera with thee


Sardea, I may have use of them. And now, my Choufera, adieu; my sad Heart bodes
I never shall see thee more.


Take not this solemn Leave, I Will see thee e're I sleep.


This poor perfidiousness of base Munzuffer has almost cured my Passion for
him; but still I am unhappy, to be the Daughter of such a wicked Mother, it is
my dearest Sister's Calamities that now afflict me most.


Where is this injured Lady, this abused Bebbemeah?


Where indeed, most generous Lord, it is noble in you to vindicate oppressed and
helpless Virtue; she is gone, I know not where, to voluntary Exile


O mad, rash, foolish Boy! thou'st thrown away a Treasure never perhaps to be
recovered; this was Callapia's doings, wicked Woman! forgive me, Lady I had
forgot she is your Mother


I wish I could forget it too, but I disown all Duty to her, who has forgot her
self and Goodness


So, Sir! you're come to triumph, are you, at the fine piece of work your
rashness has cut out; you have sent your Bebbemeah from you never to be recal'd;
there now remains no Obstacle, you would best take your Callapia, the contriver of
all this fatal mischief,


Stay, stay Choufera, and tell me what my angry Father means and where is
Bebbemeah; I do begin to think we both have been abused, and I to blame


To blame indeed, unfaithful man! you know her Innocence too well, and should
you now repent, she is gone beyond the reach of hearing thy Remorse, and by thy
treacherous Vows, broken to Heaven and her, will never be deluded more.


If, Bebbemeah, thou art guiltless, what an unhappy man has lost Munzuffer made
himself

Reveal, kind Heaven, (if so she be) her Truth and my Offense;
My Blood shall expiate the wrong is done her Innocence.

WHY where is this Chavo? the Fool is always out of the way when he should be
doing himzelf good


Look'e now, you're so hasty a Dog will not live with you, as the Saying is, call
him all to naught presently, though you know not wherefore; he is gone to put on
his Holiday clothes, I hope you would not have you fine Gentlewoman see him in
his Every-day Gere, would you trow


No, no, I Am pacified, a word to the wise; but this poor Gentlewoman is huge
molloncholy, Metam, can you tell what ails her, or who is she


No truly, not I, but Sardea says it is her Sister, though I don't believe it,
she is so much finer and handsomer; poor Heart, she takes on pitifully, it makes
a bodies Heart yern to hear her; she sighs and cries, and will not tell what the
matter's with her, and will not eat one bit of Victuals


Well, I hope our Sports will make her merry; but why don't this Boy come? one
might a cut half a Field of Rice in the time he is bin dressing, would I war
behind him, I Would make him a little quicker


Lord Husband, you have no forecast with you, let him have time to smug himself
a little, you don't know but the young Gentlewoman may cast a Sheeps-eye upon
him, and like him; Chavo's as pretty a Stripling as any's in forty mile an end,
when he'as his best Clothes on. Sardea may say what she will, but I warrant her
huge rich, she'as a Box full of the bravest shining things I ever see all days
of my Life, 'twou'd even make a-bodies Eyes dazzle to look on 'em: O Muto, if we
could get her in the mind to have our Chavo, 'twou'd be the making of us all;
and, who knows but we may ride in our Palankeens as well as the best


Away, away you fool, such a fine Gentlewoman look upon our Son! why I warrant
she never milk'd a Cow in all her Life, and knows no more how to fat our Pullen
than the Man in the Moon


For that matter, she would quickly learn. O, here comes Chavo, do but see,
Husband, how pure handsome he looks


Hei, hei! handsome, kether! sure somebody has been rouling him in the Rice;
sirrah, you a spoiled your clothes.


Nay, what de do, Faather? now to zee your ignorance, why it is all the fashion,
man; it came over from England with the last Ship came in here, there is nobody
looked upon that is not bedon zo; nay, they zay the fine Ladies like it so
hugeously, they powder their Dogs and Monkeys


Nay, nay, an it is the fashion, well and good, I Am contented.


Well, but where is thiz hanzom Gentlewoman? shaunt I zee her? adzflesh, I want
to be at her, as a body may zay


Fair and softly Son at her, marry gap, pray keep your distance, and make a
fine Leg every time you speak to her; besure you behave your self handsomely


Why what a-pies, iz she made of, musten she be tucht? zure a Man may buss her,
az a body may zay, and no harm dun


Hark'e, Sirrah, don't you be zawcy, but keep your Busses to your self you would
best, she may be angry, and leave us in a pett, and then what shall we get by
your Busses


Well, well, if I mussent I mussent, what a coil is here about a Buss! marry,
I Have laid over the Lips as good as she, and no disparagement to her: Are all
the Slaves come up? when must we begin? I long to be at it.


Not till she come, 'twont be long first.


Here Is a heavy fuss with her; an now if she wont have a body, after all, why
then all the Fat's in the Fire again


Adzflesh, is this she? she is terrible hanzom indeed, I long to be at her;
odsnigs, I have much ado to keep my


Why do thou bring me here, Sardea? such Woes as mine are not to be aleviated
by Music, I have no taste of any of their Sports, no Sound is grateful to my
bleeding Heart, but the sad note of mourning Philomel, or the repining voice of
discontented Echo: I would not see any thing that bears the Shape of faithless
Man


They Will take it unkindly, Madam, should you refuse to see their Entertainment,
they mean it well to please you, seem so however, -- you know we have use of
them as long as as we stay here, and therefore must oblige 'em





No, no, she is hougely discontented, poor Soul; I know not what the matter's
with her, go and speak to her


Nay, nay, and that be all, let me alone for speaking.
You're welcome to our House, forsooth, az a body may zay.

This is our Landlord's Son, Madam.


Thank you, Friend.


Thank you, Friend, is that all? Adzflesh, I Will to her again for all that:
You're woundy fine methinks, Mistress; Do you wear these fine Clothes every
day? you would need have a power of Money to buy such costly Gere.


I Am glad you like it.


Like it korher, I never zee the like in all my born days, not I; but for all
that, the best piece is in the middle, as a body may zay: Odsnigs, if you would but
like me half zo well, I Would quickly set you out of your dumps


Sure Fortune designs me for her Sport.


Sarrah, learn more Respect to the Gentlewoman, or I Will so belabour you, I Will
make you feel it this two days


Nay, an she be so proud, I can keep my distance an that be all; I will not come
near you again mun, if you would kiss -- Adzflesh, what was I going to zay


Pray forsooth don't take pleasure in his words, he dus not mean any harm to
you, it is for want of Wit and Manors


Marry an you would need talk of that too, 'tiz az you have taught me, and who is the
Fool then? but I meant no harm, by Jingo, not I; I only zay you're a woundy
hansom Gentlewoman, an I hope that is no Offense; but I warant I pleaz you again
when we come to dance, there is never a Lad on all the Plain can outdo me, though
I zay it that shouldn't; nay, and I can zing too, marry can I


I do not question it.


Then why are your zo stout? Are your angry because a body loves you? or is it
because you're zo much finer than I? Adsflesh, if you would but let me lie with you
two or three Nights, you would love me too; the Hogs love by lying together





What, would you have a body stand like Mumchance, az if I didn't know better
than your old moldy Chops how to car my zelf to a Gentlewoman; it is the
fashion to talk a great deal, though never zo little to the purpose, an if you
don't like't, you may leave it, an that be all


Prithee Sardea, let me not be tortured with that Fool's Impertinence, I have
more weighty Thoughts to entertain than his ridiculous Folly


Are the Dancers ready Chavo? I long to see you begin.


May be they ar, may be they ant, I Would a told her


And why will not you tell me?


Because you ant half so hansom as she; you may be angry too an you will, I
don't care


Ay, but Chavo, I can speak a good word for you to your Mistress, you know
she is my Sister, and will follow my Advice


Marry, an you will, I Will give you the best Flock of Sheep my Faather haz.


Well, say no more, you shall see what I Will do if you will but begin.


An zo we will then presently,

I Will dance and zing, and do my best to win her,
An if she will not be pleased, the Devil's in her.

You zee forsooth we be merry Folks, how de like this Sport, az a body may zay?


Exceeding well.


You dance and sing to a Miracle Chavo.


It Is your pleasure to zay zo, but I think I do pretty well for one of my
inches; Adzflesh, we will make you az merry az a Cricket if you do but stay
amongst us a little while, az a body may zay: But I can do more than this mun,
I can pitch the Bar, play at Cat and Cudgels, and wrestle with ever a one in a
good way; I Will try a Fall with you an you will forsooth.


De think Gentlewomen use to wrestle, you Boobee you?


Marry, an she may even do worse, as the Zong zays; but you ar so given to call
a body ill Names, if you wan't my Faather, adzflesh, I Would crack your Conundrum
for you; no more a Boobee than zomebody else, if you go to that


I thank you all for this Divertion, I know 'twas so designed, I hope I shall
not give Offense to any, if I retire to my Chamber, I have some Business to
dispatch requires my being alone; come Sardea





Never fear it, I Will do your business for you.


Chavo, I Will disown 'em when I grow rich, az 'tiz the fashion, for fear of
being put in mind of my Pedigree


So Sarrah, hant you carr'd your self finely, perhaps she is angry, and will
leave our House


Marry an let her be pleased again for Chavo, musten she be looked upon? it is
all long of your niggardliness; you might have let me had zome new Clothes to a
gone a suitoring in; you may even thank your zelf, what de tell me of it for


Come Metam, let us go and get the best Cheer we can for her Supper, poor Soul,
she'as eat nothing since she came


Marry, an I will not feed of her Diet then; Sardea can but get her for me, I
don't know how I shall make her amends; but she is zo coy, az if a body warn't
az good Flesh and Blood az she: Adzflesh, if I could but get zome Love-powder
and give her, that would do rarely

Well, I resolve to try what may be done,
Fair Lady with faint Heart war never won.

To 'scape me thus, when all my Plots were ripe for execution! I Am all
Confusion at it; should she return, I Am ruined for ever in all Designs upon
Munzuffer, Sennorat most zealously pleads for her Innocence, his Son, I hear,
inclines to think her so, and is deaf to all the Overtures I make him; Sennorat
is my deadly Enemy, and does suspect me of my Husband's Death, I must not
suffer such Thoughts to grow upon him, but nip'em in the Bud, take the old
Dotard off, and spoil his thinking


You're blinded with your Passion, and thirst of Bebbemeah's Blood; it is better
as it is, for had you effected your Designs upon her Life, you would have been
believed to be the Cause; and think what Hopes you then must ever have had of
your Munzuffer's Love: She Is safe enough, wherever she is, from returning
hither again, her flight was voluntary, and the same Reason that caused it will
keep her from coming back: Try all the fair means possible to gain Munzuffer,
no other way will do, Force cannot compel him to marry you


If Bebbemeah never does return, her Fortune falls to me; or if she does, I Will
take such care she never shall enjoy it: Can I before but possess my self of
dear Munzuffer, I then will happy be in spite of Fate, and triumph over the
Mischief I have done; her Wealth added to what I have already, would tempt a
King to falsify a Vow made even at the Altar: I Will find him instantly, and
will not leave till I have made him mine, if possible; but if he still persists
in his Ingratitude, I will not longer bear his Scorn, he shall be mine or no
ones else, by Heavens.


Stay Madam, you forget that Bebbemeah was the Reward you promised for my
Services


Why find her if you can, and take her, you would not have me seek her for you,
perhaps she is concealed in some of the neighboring Villages, you will do well to
search


You know I do not value her, nay, hate her for her scorn of me, it is her
Fortune, Madam, that I Would have, and do expect; consider if I do not well deserve
it


Trust to thy Mother's Care, Cemat, I Will see thee well provided for, thou do
deserve more than I have to give thee


I thank you, Madam, but I will not trust your Care or Courtesy, I claim it as
my Due; I find you do reserve it all to promote your own Happiness, and never
take care of mine


Why art thou so mistrustful of thy Mother's Love? it shall be all thine
whenever I die, and whilst I live thou shall command at all times what thou will: Be satisfied, I will most largely recompense thy Services, let me but
make Munzuffer mine, thou then shall share in all things thou can wish


Think not to put those Tricks on me you have to all beside, I know you too
well to be my self deceived; there is nothing shall or will content me, but
putting all Bebbemeah's Wealth into my present possession; you will not do
discreetly to refuse me, you know your Life is in my power, I would not
willingly betray you, but yet I will (like you) sacrifice all things to my
Interest





No fear for that, I will secure my self, therefore give me the Promise under
your own Hand, or else this very minute I will discover all your wicked
Practices


Come to my Closet half an hour hence, and there I Will make it entirely over to
thee, and more than thou desire


Swear then, As ever you hope for Happiness with Munzuffer; I know no other
Oath will bind you


I do, and wish I never may enjoy him, if I do not make thee Master of all the
Wealth that is Bebbemeah's before to morrow dawn,


I now believe you, and if you have further use of the Hand and Heart of your
obliged Son, you may command


I shall employ you, come, as I said, to my Closet half an hour hence, I have a
new Design a foot I then will tell you of,


I will be sure to wait on you. So, now I may with reason hope I Have secured
Bebbemeah's Fortune, which she dare not refuse me; I Am pleased to think how
very potent I shall be in wickedness; I must and will enjoy my Lovely Sister,
but first I Will after my pious Mother, she is hatching some new Project, I wish
it be but wicked enough, and when I Have gotten what she promised, if I can reap
advantage by it any other way, I will betray her; Honor and Honesty are
starving Qualities, it is only Wickedness that thrives in this blessed Age; I own
no Powers but Almighty Gold, that, that is the Idol of my Worship


I Am all Distractions if I have thus rashly thrown away the Blessing of my
Life, what will become of the miserable Munzuffer? Yet, oh! it cannot be, these
Eyes beheld the fatal sight, they could not be deceived; I will recover my lost
Peace again, why should I thus disturb my self for one not worth the wracking
of my Soul? she is false, and I will study to forget her


Unstable Boy! did you not say just now you did believe her blameless, and that
you would seek her through the World to beg her Pardon


I know not Sir, alas, what I think my self, my Mind's so discomposed.


Think, as you will in time find true, it was a hellish Trick of Callapia; has she
not since spread all the Snares she thinks will catch thee? I charge thee, on
my Blessing, think not of her; if thou do consent to marry her, I will
renounce thee from that hour, and wish thee always wretched


Marry her! I Would rather be condemned to endless Slavery, and never taste of
Liberty again, than have a Thought of such a thing; I hate her worse than
Death, nay, much more, for that would be welcome now, I wish I could forget all
the vast Troubles of my Mind in an eternal Sleep


Munzuffer, say not so, for thou may live to a long Age of Joys, thy Fortunes
yet are not so desperate, but we may find a Salve to heal them all, if
Bebbemeah's Innocence appears, thy Trouble's at an end; consider all the ways
Callapia has taken to bring thee to her Lust, and think if she would stick at
any thing to effect it, she knew it was impossible while Bebbemeah reigned, and
this was a Contrivance to drive her from you


How should a Slave be admitted to her Apartment without her knowledge, and
found within her Arms


Most easily; it was not an hour before you went thither her wicked Mother sent
for her, Choufera told me so, and said withal, she feared some foul Play was
designed her


What say you, Sir! O, now I do remember the very time, she likewise sent for
me, and by a Trick carried me to her Chamber to find her in that posture; too
late I see it must be so: O injured lovely Lady! where shall I find thee out,
to show my Penitence? Choufera sure can tell, I never will leave her till she
does, I Will fly with Lovers Wings, to implore her Pardon, which I too justly
fear she never will grant to the guilty Munzuffer.


No, but heard a Voice, from whence I cannot tell, it repeated your last words.


Sure it was our Fancy, here is no one near us, I hope it is Bebbemeah's good
Angel, sent to clear her Innocence. Again Sir, did you not hear it?


I did, and am amazed.


O tell me, gentle Spirit, if such thou be, where I shall find my much-wrong'd
Bebbemeah. Callapia is the cause of all this fatal mischief.


If you are a human shape, I do invoke thee, by the God you serve, to show thy
self.


This is the very same that gave me warning of my ensuing Troubles.


FOllow, follow, follow me,
Thy Enemies at jarrs thou't see:
Be thankful Youth, the Gods take care
Thy Doubts and Jealousies to clear:
Follow, follow, follow me,
The Mystery shall unravel'd be.

Go where thou will, I Will follow thee.


And I Will not stay behind.


My Guilt in her wronged Virtue does appear;
Heaven of the Innocent, I find, takes care.

I Must not now lose time in hearing thy weak Arguments, the Penitence you
insist upon was the only means to get you in my power, and now you are, you
shall not 'scape again


Heavens! what will become of me!


Not Heaven or Hell shall take you from me now.


Yonder he is, and Choufera with him, I must keep an Eye upon him till he is
safe from telling Tales, the working of the Poison may make him rave, and in
his Frenzy discover all he knows; I must remove her from him, it is not safe
that she should see him die





What shall I do? good Heaven send me some assistance.


Ha! the Villain's forcing her to his hot Lust! Cemat! what, ravish thy own
Sister


Nay, now I Have lost all hopes indeed, but since I cannot enjoy her, no other
shall.


O barbarous, inhuman, bloody Man! speak, my Choufera, to thy afflicted Mother.


He'as given me my Death, but I forgive him, and beg you would do so too.


Ha! what ails me? sure I am not well, my Head grows giddy, and my Eyes are
dim; my Body trembles, sure it is not what they call remorse, I find none in my
Heart


Stand there, you're invisible so long as you are silent.


No, Fool, thou have the just Reward of this most horrid deed, you are poisoned
by thy Mother, you drank your last in that dire Cordial I gave you in my Closet


Hell thank you for it, Fury and Vengeance direct me to sink her with me to the
black Kingdom where my Soul is going. Bebbemeah


Did not you tell me my Life was in your power? how could you think I Would tamely
bear your Threats


I can hold no longer, for fear she escapes my Vengeance give your assistance
to poor Choufera, while I secure the Murderess


She Is only in a Swoon with loss of Blood, I hope her wound's not mortal.


See Munzuffer, this is the very Villain we rescued Choufera from before; is it
possible, good Heaven, you could attempt your Sister's Honor


I have no time to answer idle Questions, if I can rally but Strength enough to
perfect my Revenge upon my unnatural Mother there, I Will die contented. She had
from me a Dose, which she gave Pechai, and that did his business; and by a
sleeping Potion given to both Bebbemeah and the Slave, it was contrived by her,
that Munzuffer should see 'em as they lay; how she effected it I need not tell
you, and did design her Death, had not her flight prevented: I was by Covenant
to have her Fortune, for my assistance to her, which basely she refused; I
threatened to betray her, for which she'as recompensed me as you see, I can no
more.


He raves, it is false as Hell each Syllable he utters.


O whither am I going! stand off, foul Fiend: O Horror, Horror! I dare not die,
I see Hell gape, and all the Devils with their forked Spears stand ready to
receive me; grim Pluto too sits in his fiery Throne, and laughs at my
Amazement: Help, help! they drag me down, oh!


You see, my Lord, how the just Gods abhor the Imputation he has laid on me, by
the disturbance of his Mind just at the point of death


No, barbarous Lady, that will not clear your Guilt, we heard you own your
Wickedness your self, no sly Evasions now shall serve your turn, I will commit
you to the Hands of Justice, and prosecute you with utmost Rigor, the
poisoning your Son is Crime enough to die for


The Injury he offered to his Sister deserved no less than death. I found him
offering Violence to her Virgin-honour, and when he see he was surpised in his
Attempt, he stabbed her; ask Choufera if it is not Truth


The Draught was given him in your Closet, Lady, you cannot shift it off, you
must along with me, and shall have all the Justice done you that your Crime
deserves: Take care, Munzuffer, of that fair bleeding Lady, and if her Wound
admits of any Cure, let nothing be spared for her recovery


Munzuffer, Daughter, will you not save me from this cruel Man?


was unkindly done: Where am I, in Munzuffer's Arms? Nay, then I will not live
to be snatched from these Embraces: Alas, I need not say I will not, cold Death
sits busy at my Heart, and I am going where I shall find an everlasting end to
all my Woes


Dear Choufera, for Pity tell me where to find the injured Bebbemeah, your
Brother with his latest Breath declared her so, accused himself and thy most
barbarous Mother to be the cause of all this deadly mischief


Too credulous Munzuffer! that you could believe her guilty of so black a Sin!
but I Will not now upbraid you, the Remorse you feel is Punishment enough, that
Paper will direct you where to find her; I was going thither now, when my
impious Brother, disappointed of his brutish Lust, did this bloody Deed: When
you have reconciled your justly-angry Mistress, sometimes reflect on poor
Choufera's Misfortunes, who (had she lived) must always have been unhappy;
for, oh! before my Soul expires, take, take the long-hid Secret, that I love
you, my dear Lord; permit me so to call you, since it is not many minutes I have
left to repeat that charming sound: O turn those Eyes away, or I shall die with
blushing. Comfort my Bebbemeah, for my untimely Death, I know so well she loved
me, 'twill grieve her much; commend me to her: my Business on Earth's done, and
I have nothing else to do but die. Grieve not, Munzuffer, at my Death, it
brings me what I wish, eternal Peace, an end of all my Misery here, and
boundless Pleasure in the Elizian Fields, where we shall meet again: May you be
blessed in all things with your dear Bebbemeah; farewell: take this first, last,
and chaste Embrace from poor Choufera.


Bebbemeah.

At Muto's House, on the Levoan Plain, close by the Menam's side; she is there
concealed: I know it well, it is not a full mile off, I will not sleep till I
atone her Anger.

I Will fly with Lovers Wings, to appease the injured Fair,
And meet the just Reproaches of my angry Dear.

What shall I tamely yield my Body to the Stake? I cannot, must not die, I Have
yet a Work to do I must not leave unfinished, I Will summon all the Devils to my
aid, but I will compass it: Two Murders, what is that! 'twill hardly give me
place in Hell fitting my quality, I Would have a Hecatomb of Ghosts to attend me
there: I Am grieved for poor Choufera's death, and for Cemat's too, but it is
because I have him not to kill again; oh that the Villain had as many Lives as
Hydra Heads, that I might stab him in each one, and be an Age in killing him


Thou have not so long to live, most miserable Woman! e're this to morrow thou
shall be with me in endless Torment not to be expressed, the just Reward of all
thy horrid Crimes, thy fatal Thread is spun, and thy unalterable Doom
pronounced


Thou lie, cursed Wretch, thou lie.


It is too true, and is decreed above in those blessed Courts where thou must
never come, inhuman Murderess! O think, thou wretched Woman, on thy lost
Condition; think how you can bear the scorching Flames about your tender Limbs,
which never never are to be extinguished; let thy Associate there tell the
Miseries which attend thee, whilst I return to my blessed Habitation, and praise
the Gods for their just Vengeance on thee.


Farewell, old godly Fool, I do not wish to come where I may have thy Company
again


Thou't wish for any thing but what thou art condemned to, most unrelenting
Sinner! Prometheus Vulture! Tantalus's Feast, or the Belides never finished
Labor is all but Sport to what is reserved for thee; think not I come to warn
you to repent, it is now too late, despair and die, and be as cursed as I am.




If in those fiery Regions I must dwell,
I Will do such things shall make me Queen of Hell.

I wonder my Choufera does not come, has she forgot forsaken Bebbemeah? Prithee
Sardea sing the Song you used to entertain me with

'TWas on a fatal day by chance a lovely Swain I saw,
His graceful Mein and noble Air did my attention draw.
When on his Knees the timorous Youth did first my Pity move,
With tender Sighs and moving Tears he swore eternal love.
I soon believed what most I wished; for, ah too heedless Maid!
The easy Conquest he obtained my treacherous Eyes betrayed.
He gained the soft Confession too from my unguarded Heart
In Transports all over ecstasy, but all, alas, was Art;
For now the false forsworn forgets his Vows to Heaven and me;
Regardless of my Honor too, he boasts his Perjury.
Ye Gods, if injured Innocence be your peculiar care,
Revenge my Wrongs on that false Man, and wounded Fame repair.

Adzflesh, forsooth, yonder haz been a most heavy racket, by the zide of the
Wood, there is a curious hansom Gentlewoman lies as dead as a Herring, and
bleeds like any stuck Pig


Ha! what say you, a Lady killed! by what means do you know?


Nay, I cannot tell that; for my part, I thought at first it waz you, methought
she waz az like you az if she had been spit out of your Mouth, az a body may
zay


Did you see her? what was her Habit? O Sardea, Heaven send it is not Choufera;
was any body with her


Zee her! I think I did, there was a great many fine Folks.


It is Munzuffer, Madam.


Sardea, let us be gone, I will not see that faithless man.


Stay, stay, fair injured Lady, thus low I humbly beg you will hear the guilty
Munzuffer speak


Too well, false Man, you know the way to Bebbemeah's Heart, I must not will
not hear you; you did deny to me when most I pleaded for it, remember that,
thou perjured Man





I do too well, and many faults beside:


Tell me, Munzuffer, is Choufera well? Ha, you look sad and sigh; answer me, I
charge you, what is become of her, and by what means you found me here





Forbear to hear what will increase thy Grief to such a weight too heavy to be
born





Since you will force me to be the unhappy Messenger of such dismal tidings,
Choufera's killed by barbarous Cemat, the cause I Will take another time to tell;
he is poisoned by his Mother, and before he died confessed the wrong they had
done your virtue and my love


O my Choufera, my dearest tender Sister! it is I, unhappy Slave, have been the
cause of all these sad Misfortunes


She expired within my Arms, bid me commend her to you, and comfort you for her
untimely Fall


Alas, what Comfort can I ever receive for such a Loss! my only constant Friend
on Earth is gone, I hope I shall not long remain behind her


O say not so, cruel Bebbemeah, thou have a Friend which ever will be yours;
how shall I atone for my Offense? is it not possible you can forgive





No, never; the Injuries you have done me are of such a nature, to pardon would
look as if I were conscious of the Guilt you threw upon me, and were glad on
any terms to pass it by; Callapia, she will be angry, indeed she will, and
chide you most unmercifully


What mean you Bebbemeah? my Callapia! I Would sooner take a Witch, a Succubus, to
my Arms: I do believe in Hell there is not such another Fury


Her Wealth, my Lord, will make you compensation for all Personal Defects; and
for her Mind, the blacker it is, the more like thee, perfidious Man.


By Heaven you wrong me, Madam, her Wealth and her I equally contemn, I ever
scorn her loathsome Love, which has created all these sad Distractions; 'twill
soon be seen how well I love her, the Murder of your Father is detected, done
by her cursed Hand, for which she is to die


Merciless Woman! when shall I find an end to all my Sorrows? they still
increase, and will at last overwhelm me.


Still worse and worse; all I can say to justify my self turns to my
disadvantage; may I for ever be deprived of you, the greatest Curse I can wish,
if ever I had a Thought of loving any else since the first moment that I see
you; were that vile Creature which you unjustly tax me with Empress of all our
wealthy Indies, I Would scorn her as I have already done


How can you hope I ever should? all I could say you would not lend an Ear to.


Upbraid me not with what it is Death to hear; all my whole Life shall be a
continued Service, to expiate that one Fault: I do not blame your Anger, you
have just reason for it; the mighty Gods are pacified by Penitence, and all I
now dare ask is only your forgiveness


Suppose, my Lord, I should, you do not think I ever will put my self in that
man's power who could so easily believe so poorly of my Virtue? I need not say
I will not, I do not find you do desire it: You say you wish for nothing but
Forgiveness; you have it, Sir. Now I suppose I may be gone, you have nothing else
to ask


Still, Madam, you reproach me with the only Blot I ever was ashamed of; I do
indeed deserve your utmost Rigor, but O, unkind it is to say I Have nothing else
to ask! I have a mighty Boon, too much for you to give or me to crave; my
Wishes are unbounded, but still they center all in Bebbemeah. Think if the
hoarding Miser would be pleased to have his Coffers rifled, and all his Idol
Gold thrown into the Sea; if so, believe I Have no desires to be possessed of what
I most adore, fair Bebbemeah





O no, you do not, if you did you would run into these faithful loving Arms;
convince me that you do so, and let me conduct you home


How Munzuffer! can you think I will return to live in the same place where my
blasted Fame by this is grown the public Talk? No, I will seek some Desert far
from the Society of human Conversation, where I will spend my melancholy days,
and never return to this bad World again


Is this Forgiveness, obdurate Bebbemeah? I cannot live without you, I swear by
all that is good I will not, the minute that you leave me I Will with my Blood,
since nothing else will do, implore your Pity, and wash away my Guilt


I could most willingly consent to your Desires, but still so much I owe my
injured Honor, I must and will resolve to never see thee more; take, if you
will, a parting Kiss, sure I may give that without offense to Modesty, since
it is the last Favor you must ever receive from Bebbemeah's Love; for, O
Munzuffer! can thou think it, for all this usage I have had, I love thee
still


O no, I will not taste of Bliss, to make the deprivation of it more
intolerable: Since then it must be so, farewell indeed for ever


Rash Boy! what mean you?


O! I can hold no longer. Bebbemeah can give you Life; I yield to thy
all-conquering Love, dispose me as you will, clear but my Reputation, and I Am
yours for ever


Some help, good Sir, to support this Ecstasy, I Have now more need of Moderation
than under my pressing Grief: Am I awake? I know not how to trust my Senses
with this happy change of my Condition


I Am glad, fair injured Lady, there is no use for my Authority to carry you
back: Your Reputation has, if possible, received a double Luster by the black
detraction; all wait with eager haste to see due Justice done on your inhuman
Mother, and in a fury they drag the Body of wicked Cemat about the Streets;
I Have brought a Chariot to conduct you home in triumph over your Foes


My Lord, I Will wait upon you when you please; Sardea, stay and let our kind
Landlord and his Family know where I would see them, to gratify their
Troubles.


Bear witness, Gods, I envy not your boasted Bliss above,
Nor would I change my Happiness to be the mighty Jove.
Look ye there now, I thought how much you would speak a good word for one; I would
that old Man had even let him have killed himself, and then may be I might have
got her in the mind, and now he is gone away with her, and I shall never zee her
again all days of my breath.


Alas poor Chavo! come man, have patience, you shall see her again presently,
did you not hear her invite you to her House? come, come, there is Hopes still,
dry up your Eyes, we will take your Father and Mother and follow her.


Will you not think on your unhappy state? You cannot hope for Pardon in this
World, you know your Crimes deserve none, repent e're it is too late, or you
will be condemned to the infernal Dungeon, where you must live in endless
Torments, never to be released


I Will tell you a Secret, but be sure you tell no body of it: Ceres will send
her winged Dragons for me, and bear me through the Air, I Will get into the Zodiac,
turn the Bear out of her Skin, and creep into it, so close that they shall never
find me; ha, ha, ha, how I shall laugh to look down and see 'em searching for
me


Sure she is distracted, I know not what to think of her. Madam, will you not
think of your Condition


Ha! thou art old Pechai, I know thee now; did I not poison thee? Away, away
with that old worn-out Face, I Will send thee to Medea to be new boiled, and when
thou art young again I will be fond of thee; let her take pattern by Munzuffer,
be sure you be like him, I will not love thee else


I find it now, her Guilt has turned her Brain, there is no hopes to make a
Mad-woman hear Reason, she may perhaps have an outrageous Fit, and do me
mischief.


Will thou then leave me, cruel Munzuffer? I will not part with thee; thus,
thus I Will clasp thee to me, Bebbemeah. Ha, stand off,


I hope her Fit is over, and she will have an interval of Sense; it grows late,
Madam, the Officers by this time wait for you, repent and think whither you are
going


Did not I call for Music? but let it be such as will best suit the Discord of
my Soul, the Shrieks of the Damned, the Cries of tortured Infants, the Howlings
of the Free born Wretch condemned to endless Slavery; this is the Harmony will
please my Ear. Hark! did you not hear the clattering of Chains? Oh for Aeneas's
Cloak to shroud me in: Who art thou? speak: it is poor Choufera, I know her by
her Wound.


She is relapsed, would I were fairly rid of her.


Thou shall not go, we are to have a Feast, which you must partake of: Fie,
fie, leave a Banquet, where thou may feast thy most luxurious Gut with
choicest Dainties! I Will snatch the curling Snakes from Tiryphone's Head, 'twill
make a most delicious Dish; a Sallad too we will have of Aconite and Hellebore,
and drink in flowing Bowls, instead of Nectar, Blood; what think thou of
that? I know it will down with thee seasoned with a Gold Goblet: Prithee tell
me, how do they fare in Hell


Too soon I fear you will know, most miserable Woman.


Cannot you tell, do you say? be gone and see,


Oh! I am slain! --


I charge you clear the way, I do not love a Crowd, tell 'em I Am coming, bid
old Charon be ready with his Boat. Ha! what is this, a Shower of Blood! it is old
Pechai's, where, where shall I shelter, 'twil drown me, who'd a thought he had
so much in his old shrivel'd Body? I Am sick at Heart, oh for a Cordial from the
Lethean River, to pass a dark Oblivion on all my forepast Life.


Ha, what means this, a holy Father slain! had you not Murder enough upon your
guilty Soul, but you must add a fresh one just as you're going to give an
Account in the other World of what you have done already, impious Sinner! Call
for the Officers, and let her presently be executed, each minute that she lives
draws a new Crime upon her.


Hush, hush, Cerberus, don't wake him, he will give a triple bark will fright us
back to Hell again


What, you would feign Distraction to save your Life! that will not do, Lady,
we too well know you Mistress of the Trade of Falsehood and Deceit; I brought
these wronged Lovers, that you may ask Forgiveness before you leave the World,
for the unheard of Injuries you have done them


Lovers, say you! O they are Orpheus and Euridice; take, take her, and run away
with her, don't you look back and lose her again, you have ventured hard for
her, but not so much as I have done for cruel unkind Munzuffer. Ha! do you not
see you blazing Comet? it points just full at me: Shoot, shoot, I fear you not,
you cannot pierce my Heart, it is hard as solid Adamantine Rocks, and will
rebound your Darts up to the Skies again


Do not thus madly rave, but tell me why you killed this holy Man; What could
provoke you to such a cursed deed


Look not on him, it is Medusa's Head, 'twil turn thee into stone as hard as
Munzuffer's stubborn Heart always was to me


Alas, I pity her, she is mad indeed.


Reserve thy Pity for a nobler Cause, she deserves it not from any; Vexation
and Despair has made her thus


If she has lost her Senses, she has not her wicked Inclinations, there is a
fresh bleeding Instance of it.


I cannot but have Compassion for the Mother of my dear Choufera.


And for the Murdress of thy Father, Bebbemeah, think of that.


That was indeed a hellish fact, and never to be forgiven.


Forgiveness say you! is there then Mercy for me? did you not talk of my
Choufera? O show me where she is: I see her, she is yonder fleeting in the milky
way; stay, stay, dear Child, and take thy Mother with thee: wonderful! she is
dissolved into a Star, and shines just in my Face, I cannot bear the Luster, my
Eye Balls ache with gazing, let me repose them in eternal Night, and lay me fast
to sleep, where I may never never wake again.


Yes, you shall be laid to sleep, but will be quickly roused by Pains will keep
you ever waking


Alack poor Gentlewoman, she is in a pitiful plight, she is upon the hard floor,
poor Soul


Ai, ai, I warrant you would have no Woman die for poisoning her Husband, it is that
you would all be at if you dared; even let her be burnt, I say, she deserves it


Do your Office, and take her to the Stake, secure her fast, she either feigns
a Lunacy, or is so; there lies a holy man just slain by her


Radamanthus, do but blot out the Murder of my Husband, and the false
imputation laid on Bebbemeah, I Will stand my Trial for the rest. Ha! it is Cemat,
now I will be revenged on him indeed, I Will spoil his Evidence in Hell against
me: see, see, he steals away, will you not stop him? he is gone, and I will
follow him, he shall not 'scape my Vengeance so. Callapia, you will quickly
overtake him, it is a broad Road, and down Hill all the way.


Unhappy Woman! thou have put a dreadful period to thy wickedness, and draws
Compassion from me, though an Enemy to all thy Cruelties. Now, Bebbemeah, I Will
resign the Charge your noble Father trusted me withal, and thus I give it up.
Munzuffer, and beg the Gods to give thee Merit to deserve the richest Prize
that ever happy Youth was blessed with


From the great Gods and you I thankfully receive the only Blessing which they
have in store to make Munzuffer happy.

So the joy'd Merchant, who with Storms long tossed
Sees his dear Wealth and Hopes of Life all lost:
When unexpected the Heavens grow clear and smile,
And safely lands him after all his Toil,
At the long-wish'd for Haven;
Such Joys too weakly does my Bliss express,
No Thoughts or Words can reach my Happiness.

MY Faather is a Landed Man, haz Acres of hiz own,
Pays scot and lot, and Office bears, beholden is to none;
Haz Cow and Kine, haz Goats and Horse, and Rupies too good store,
Which will be Chavo's all in time, with many a good thing more,
Two Folds of Sheep, an Herd of Boars the common size exceeding;
And zince from Holland came their size, you need not doubt their breeding.
A flock of Geese of wisest Race, came from Fingallian Highland,
Enough to plant a Colony in a West Indian Island.
Of Asses too as grave as Sancho's he up to War does train,
To car the English powdered Beaux to make the next Campaign.
And something else shall nameless be, Chavo has more than Purse;
If all will not your Favor win, adz flesh, you may do worse.
