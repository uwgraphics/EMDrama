DRawn by Commanding Love,
Imperial Jove,
Designs to Visit some New tempting fair
There is no end of his Amors.
No sooner one has quit the Field,
But others to his Godhead yield,
And so imploys my hours:
See where the first of Gods descending.
All Nature his known will attending.

HAste, haste my Son, my Love admits of no delay
In yonder Tyrian Grove
You Will find my Love,
Begone, and with your awful wand prepare.
All things for my reception there.

Pressed with my greifs who can my sorrows end?
There Is none.

There is,

Ah no.

There is a Friend.

Who is that Friend that will so Courteous prove?

Your Greifs are pitty'd by the mighty Jove.

When will that Potent God ordain my fate?

With patience till the happy Minute wait.

APpear all appear your kind Mistress to show
What wondrous things you can do.
Let sorrow and care,
Pale Cheeks and despair
For ever Europa be strange to the Fair.

HOW passingly fine these Gay whimsies here dance.
Come come my dear Malkin let us too advance,
In spite of their frisks and their Capers so high,
I Will show what Buff Jerkin can do by and by.

STreams of Pleasure here abounding
Make blessed the Shepherds of this Grove,
Eternal Joys the Nymphs surrounding
Produce the effects of Lasting love.
Here no buisy heads aspiring
Study the ruin of the great,
But each swain his Lass admiring,
Laughs at the turmoyls of the great.
But each swain his Lass, etc.

Still I Am Greiving Still Lamenting
Still Complaining of my Fate,
Still the Cruel Gods Consenting
Add New troubles to my State.

Give than Royal maid your sorrows over
Implore no longer Heaven in vain,
Since there is above no bliss in store
Search here below your Joys to gain.

Give than Royal Maid, etc.

AT London che've been, at London che've been
And c'have seen the King and the Queen'a
C'have seen Lords and Earls,
And many fine Girls,
That turned up their tails at fifteen'a.
Che've seen the Lord Mayor,
And Bartholdom Fair,
And their I met with the Draggon,
That St. George that bold Knight,
Fought and Killed outright
Whilst a man could toss off a flaggon.
From thence as I went
To see the Monument,
I met with a Girl in Cheapside'a,
That for half a Crown
Plucked up her silk Gown,
And showd me how far she could stride'a.

What else I did see,
Is nothing to me,
For if she had such tricks as these be,
I Am sure she is a whore
Therefore say no more,
Nor think that I e're will be pleased with ye.

Nay prithee now hold,
And don't cry nor scold
If you know what it is to be quiet,
I went but to try
If that I could spy
How I could like Londoners diet.

And for ought I see
The're not like to we,

Faith and Troth it is a folly to lie
I think they are not

No John not a jot

Joan -- I prithee come in and let us try.

Na good now la-be
Give an Inch I see
You Will take -- Pish-hie-what's the matter?
Why sure John you wont

I Am a Dog and I don't,
Now I Am set on it, let what will come after.

SLeep Close the Eyes of all that is here
For mighty Jove will straight appear
And Mortals must not dare to veiw
What Jove on Earth resolves to do.

What whipster are you? that dares here resort,
Adzooks to hinder our sport:
Begone and quit the place
Or Crab-stick here shall wipe you over the Face
'Flesh and Bones do you laugh, I shall mawle.

Hail Royal maid? beloved of Heaven,
Pattern of Chastity Divine
A votary to Great Diana's Shrine,
To you a present Jove has given,
Close by the Sea it stands
Waiting to be received by your Fair hands.

Blessed be Jove.
To him I Will daily incense pay,
And at his Altars Maiden offerings lay
Both for his Gift and Love.

Adzooks I have had a most Notable Nap.
But where is our Mistress, adsniggs she is gone,
O dismal mishap.
We Are all quite undone.

Look She Is on a Bull's back in the midst oth' Sea.
Ods flesh what will now become of poor me.

Is there no succor, help, are Gods too grown
Ravishers, help help, oh Heavens is there is none.

UNdone Europa by a God undone;
Is then Astrea fled from Heaven,
Oh whether is the Goddess driven?
To the Infernal Cave she is gone.
Confusion, Horror, Death, all come,
For in my Ravished Breast for you is Room:
Who Is there?
Ha! it is my Ravisher!
Oh let me fly the hated God.
I feel I go
To Shades below,
My Last abode.

RAise her my Son, no more my Fair,
Lament, for thou shall be a Star,
Sound Music from the Spears her mind to ease,
And tune her Soul for the Immortal bliss.

See where the God and Nymphs ascending,
And Choirs of Spirits them attending,
They Mount, they Mount the seats of rest
Where Souls are with Immortal Pleasures Blessed.
