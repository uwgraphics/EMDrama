Boy?


Here sit!


Lay by my conscience, give me my Gown,
That weed is for the country,
We must be civil now, and match out Evil,
Who first made Civil, black; he pleased the Devil;
So; now know I where I am, me thinks already
I graspe best part of the Autumnian blessing
In my contentious fadome, my hand's free,
From wronger and from wronged I have fee,
And what by sweat from the rough earth they draw,
Is to enrich this silver harvest, Law,
And so through wealthy variance, and fat brawle,
The Barn is made but Steward to the Hall;
Come they up thick enough?

Oh like hops and harlots sir!


Why do thou couple them?


Oh very aptlye, for as the hop well boiled will make a man not stand upon his
legs: so the harlot in time will leave a man no legs to stand upon


Such another and be my heir, I have no Child,
Yet have I wealth would redeem beggary,
I think it be a curse both here and foreign,
Where bags are fruitful'st, there the womb's most barren,
The poor has all our children, we their wealth;
Shall I be prodigal when my life cooles,
Make those my heirs whom I have beggared; Fools?
It would be wondrous; rather beggar more,
Thou shall have heirs enough, thou keep'st a whore,
And here comes kindred too with no mean purses,
Yet strive to be still blessed with Clients curses.

What subtlety have we here? a fellow
Shrugging for life's kind benefits, shift and heat,
Crept up in 3. Terms, wrapped in silk and silver,
So well appointed too with Page and Pandar,
It was a happy gale that blew him hither.

And like Asses use such men,
When their load's off, turn them to graze again.
And may our wish have full effect, Many a suite, and much neglect.
And as it has been often found, Let the Clients cups come round.
Help your poor kinsmen when you ha got them. You may drink deep, leave us
the bottom
Or when there is a lamb fallen in, Take you the lamb, leave us the skin.
Your duty and regard has moved us,
Never till now we thought you loved us,
Take comfort from our words, and make no doubt,
You shall have suites come sixteen times about.

We humbly thank the patron of our hopes.

With what a vassaile -- appetite they Gnawe,
On our reuersions; and are proud,
Coldly to taste our meats, which eight returns
Serve in to us as courses;
One day our writs like wilde-fowle fly abroad,
And then return over Cities, Towns, and Hills,
With Clyents like dried strawes between their bills;
And it is no few birds pick to build their Neasts,
Nor no small money that keeps Drabs and Feasts!

But Gentlemen, to spread my self open unto you, in cheaper Terms I salute
you, for ours have but sixpenny fees all the year long, yet we dispatch you
in two hours, without demur; your Suites hang not long here after Candles be
lighted: Why we call this play by such a dear and chargeable Title, Michaelmas
Term? Know it consents happilye to our purpose, tho perhaps faintlie to the
interpretation of many; for he that expects any great quarrels in Law to be
handled here, will be fondly deceived, this only presents those familiar
accidents, which happend in Town in the circumference of those six weeks,
whereof Michaelmas Term is Lord: Sat sapienti, I hope there is no fools in the
house

What Master Rerrage?


Master Salewood* Exceedingly well met in Town, comes your Father up this
Term


Why he was here three days before the Exchequer gapte.


Fie, such an early Termer?


He Is not to be spoke withal, I dare not ask him blessing, till the last of
November


And how looks thy little venturing Coosen?


Faith like a Lute that has all the stringes broke, no body will meddle with
her


Fie, there are Doctors enough in Town will string her again, and make her
sound as sweet as ere she did, is she not married yet


Sh' as no luck, some may better steal a horse than others look on. I have
known a virgin of five bastardes wedded, faith when all is done we must be
feign to marry her into the North I Am affrayd


But will she pass so think you?


Puh, any thing that is warm enough is good enough for them; so it come in
the likeness, tho the Devil be in it, the'ile venture the fiering


They Are worthy spirits in faith, heard you the News?


Not yet.


Mistress Difficult is fallen a widdowe.


Say true, is Master Difficult the Lawyer dead?


Easily dead sir.


Pray when died he?


What a question's that? when should a Lawyer dye but in the vacation, he has
no leisure to die in the Tearmetime, beside the Noise there would fetch him
again


Knew you the nature of his disease.


Faith some say he dyed of an old grief he had, that the vacation was
fourteen weeks long


And very likely. I knew 'twould kill him at last, t'as troubled him a long
time, he was one of those that would feign have brought in the heresy of a
fifth Term, often crying with a loud voice, oh why should we loose Bartholmew
week


He savors, stop your Nose, no more of him.


Young master Easy, let me salute you sir, when came you?


I have but Inn'd my horse since master Cockstone.


You seldom visit London master Easy,
But now your Fathers dead it is your only course,
Here Is gallants of all sizes, of all lasts,
Here you may fit your foot, make choice of those
Whom your affection may rejoice in:

You have easily possessed me I am free,
Let those live hindes that know not liberty.

Master Rerrage?


Good master Salewood, I am proud of your society.


What gentleman might that be?


One master Esaias, h'as good and in Essex,
a fair free-brested Gentleman, somewhat too open,
bad in man, worse in woman,
the Gentrye-fault at first, he is yet fresh
and wants the City powdring, but what news?
Is It yet a match twixt master Qomodoes the rich Drapers
daughter and your self.

Faith sir, I am vildly riuald!


Vildly? by whom.


One Andrewe Lethe crept to a little warmth, and now so proud that he forgets
all storms, one that nere wore apparel, but like ditches 'twas cast before
he had it, now shines bright in rich embroderies, him master Quomodo affects,
the daughter him, the mother only me, I rest most doubtful, my side being
wookest


Yet the mothers side being surer than the Fathers, it may prove, men plead
for money best, women for love


Slid master Quomodo?


How then, afraid of a woollen draper.


He warned me his house, and I hate he should see me abroad!


Oh my 2. spirits Shortyard and Falselight, you that have so enricht me, I have
industry for you both


Then do you please us best sir.


Wealthy employment.


You make me icth sir.


You Falselight as I have directed you.


I am nimble.


Go, make my course commodities, look, seek, with subtle art beguile the
honest eye, be near to my trapwindowe, cunning Falselight


I never failde it yet.


I know thou did not;
But now to thee my true and secret Shortyard,
Whom I dare trustee'n with my wife,
Thou nere did mistress harm, but master, good,
There are too few of thy name Gentlemen,
And that we feel, but Citizens abundance,
I have a task for thee my pregnant spirit,
To exercise thy poynted wits upon.

Give it me, for I thirst.

Thine care shall drink it,
Know then I have not spent this long Vacation
Only for pleasures sake, give me the man
Who out of recreation culls advantage,
Dives into seasons, never walks, but thinks,
Ne^ides, but plots, my journey was toward Essex.

Most true?


Where I have seen what I desire.


A woman?


Puh; a woman, yet beneath her, that which she often treades on. Yet commands
her land, fair neat Land


What is the mark you shoot at.


Why the fairest to cleave the heir in twain, I mean his Title to murder his
estate, stifle his right in some some detested prison, there are means and
ways enough to hook in Gentry, besides our deadlye enmitye which thus stands
they are busye 'bout our wives, We 'bout their Lands


Your revenge is more glorious,
To be a cuckold is but for one life,
When land remains to you, your heir, or wife!

Ah sirrah, do we stinge'm, this fresh gallant rode newly up before me!


I beseech his name.


Young master Easy.


Easy? It may fall right.


I have inquired his haunt, stay, ha, I that, it is, that's he, that's he!


Happily!


Observe, take surely note of him, he is fresh and free shift thy self
speedily into the shape of gallantrye, I Will swell thy purse with angels, keep
foot by foot with him, out-dare his expenses, flatter, dice, and brothell to
him, give him a sweet taste of Sensuality, train him to every wastfull sin,
that he may quickly need health, but especially money, ravish him with a dame
or two, be his bawd for once, I Will be thine for ever, drink drunk with
him, creep into bed to him, kiss him and undo him, my sweet spirit


Let your care dwell in me soon shall it shine, What subtlety is in man, that
is not mine


O my most cherefull spirit, go, dispatch, Gentrye is the chief fish we
Tradesmen catch


What Is here?


Oh, they are bills for Chambers.


Against Saint Andrews, at a Painters house, there is a fair chamber ready
furnished to be let, the house not only endewed with a new fashion forepart,
but which is more convenient for a Gentleman, with a very provident backe-doore


Why here is virtue still; I like that thing that is necessary, as well as
pleasant


What news in yonder paper.


Ha? seek you for news, there is for you!


Whose it is? in the name of the black Angels, Andro Gruill.


No, Andro Lethe!


Lethe?


Has forgot his fathers name, poor Walter Gruill that begot him, fed him, and
brought him up


Not hither.


No; 'twas from his thoughts, he brought him up below.


But does he pass for Lethe.


Among strange eyes that no more know him, then he knows himself, that's
nothing now, for master Andro Lethe, a gentleman of most received parts,
forgetfulness, Lust, Impudence, and Falsehood, and one especial Courtly quality;
to wit, no wit at all, I am his Rival for Quomodoes daughter, but he knows
it not


Has spyed us ore his paper.


Oh that's a warning to make our duties ready.


Salute him, hang him.


Puh, wish his health a while, heel be laid shortly, let him gorge Venison
for a time, our doctors will bring him to dry mutton; seem respective to make
his pride swell like a Toade with dew


Master Lethe!


Sweet master Lethe.


Gentlemen your pardon, I remember you not.


Why we supt with you last night sir!


Oh cry you mercy, it is so long ago,
I had quite forgot you, I must be forgiven,
Acquaintaince, dear society, suites and things,
Do so flow to me; that had I not the better memory!
Twould be a wonder I should know my self,
Esteem is made of such a dizzy metal;
I have received of many gifts ore night
Whom I have forgot ere morning, meeting the men,
I wished em to remember me again,
They do so: then if I forget again,
I know what helped before, that will help then,
This is my course, for memory I have been told
Twenty preserues, the best I find is gold;
Ey truly! are you not knights yet, Gentlemen.

Not yet!


No, that must be looked into, it is your own sault,
I have some store of Venison, where shall we devour it,
Gentlemen?

The horn were a fit place.

For Venison, fit,
The horn having chaste it,
At the horn -- we will Rhyme to that. --

Taste it.


Wast it.


Cast it.


That's the true rhyme indeed, we hunt our Venison
twice I tell you, first out a'th park, next out a'th Belly.

First dogs take pains to make it fit for men,
Then men take pain to make it fit for dogs.

Right.

Why this is kindness, a kind Gallant, you,
And love to give the dogs more than their due,
We shall attend you sir.

I pray do so.


The horn.


Easily remembered that you know!


But now unto my present business, the Daughter yeildes, and Quomodo consents,
only my mistress Quomodo, her mother without regard runs full against me, and
sticks hard! Is there no law for a woman that will run upon a man at her own
apperill. Why should not she consent, knowing my state, my sudaine fortunes, I
can command a custerd, and other bakemeats, death of sturgeon, I could keep
house with nothing, what friends have I? how wellam I beloved, even quite
throughout the scullery, not consent? it is even as I have writ, I Will be hanged,
and she love me not herself and would rather preserve me, as a private friend
to her own pleasures, than any way advance her daughter upon me to beguile
herself, then how have I relieved her in that point, let me peruse this
letter. Good mistress Quomodo, or rather as I hope ere the Term end, mother
Quomodo, since only your consent keeps a loofe off and hinders the copulation
of your daughter, what may I think, but that it is a mere affection in you,
doting upon some small inferior virtue of mine, to draw me in upon your
self, if the case stand so, I have comfort for you: for this you may well
assure your self, that by the marriage of your daughter I have the better
means and opportunity to your self, and without the least suspicion. This is
moving stuff, and that works best with a Citizens wife, but who shall I get
to convey this now: my Page I halent forth, my Pandar I have imployd about the
country, to look out some third sister, or entice some discontented
Gentlewoman from her husband, who^e the laying out of my appetite shall
maintain, nay I Will deal like an honorable Gentleman, I Will be kind to women,
that which I gather in the day, I Will put into their purses at night, you shall
have no cause to rail at me, no faith, I Will keep you in good fashion Ladies,
no meaner men then knights shall ransom home your gowns, and recover your
smocks, I Will not dallye with you -- some poor widow woman would come as a
necessary bawd now: and see where fitly comes -- my mother! curse off poverty
does she come up to shame me, to betray my birth, and cast soil upon my new
Suite, let her pass me, I Will take no notice of her, Scuruye -- murrey -- Carsey

By your leave and like your worship.


Then I must proudly venture it; to me good woman.


I beseech one word with your worship.


Prithee be breife then.


Pray can your worship tell me any tidings of one Andro Gruill, a poor son
of mine own


I know a gallant Gentleman of the name, one master Andro Gruill and well
receiude amongst Ladies


That not he then!

He is no Gentleman that I mean.


Good woman if he be a Gruill, he is a Gentleman in the mornings: that's a
Gentleman a'th first, you cannot tell m


No truly, his father was an honest upright Tooth-drawer.


O my teeth.


An't please your worship, I have made a fore journey out, all this vacant
time, to come up and see my son Andro, poor Walter Gruill his Father has
laid his life, and left me a lone woman, I have not one husband in all the
world, therefore my coming up is for relief an't like your worship, hoping
that my son Andro is in some place about the Kitchen


Kitchen, puh, fah.


Or a seruingman to some Kinght of worship.


Oh let me not endure her! Know you not me good woman?


Alas, an't pleease your worship, I never saw such a glorious suite since
the hour I was ^ersend


Good, she knows me not, my glory does disquire me,
Beside my poorer name being drencht in Lethe,
She Will hardly understand me, what a fresh air can do!
I may employ her as a private drudge,
To pass my letters and secure my lust,
And nere be noted mine, to shame my blood,
And drop my stayning birth upon my raiment, faith good
woman you will hardly get to the speech of master Andro,
I tell you.

No?

Marry hang him, and like your Worship, I have known the day when no body
card to speak to him


You must take heed how you speak ill of him now I cantell you; he is so
employde


Imployde for what?


For his behavior, wisdom, and other virtues.


His virtues? no it is well known, his father was too poor a man to bring him
up to any virtues; he can scarce write and read


He Is the better regarded for that amongst Courtiers, for that's but a needy
quality


If it be so, then heel be great shortly, for he has no good parts about him.


Well good woman, or mother, or what you will.


Alack the day, I know your worship scorns to call me mother: it is not a thing
fit for your worship indeed, such a simple old woman as I am


In pity of thy long journey, there is sixpence British: tend upon me, I have
business for you


I Will wait upon your Worship.


Two pole off at least.


I am a clean old woman, an't like your Worship.


It goes not by cleannes here good woman, if you were fowler, so you were
brauer, you might come nearer


Nay and that be the fashion, I hope I shall


Come, leave your puling and sighing.


Beshrew you now, why did you entice me from my father


Why? to thy better advancement, would thou a pretty beautiful -- Iuicy
squall, live in a poor thrumbd house in the cuntry in such servile --
habiliments, and may well pass for a gentlewoman in the City, does not 5
hundred do so think thou, and with worse faces, oh, now in these latter
days, the Devil raygning it is an age for cloven creatures? but why sad now?
yet indeed it is the fashion of any Curtizan to be sea-sicke in the first Voyage,
but at next she proclaims open wars, like a beaten soldier: why
Northamptonshire Less do dream of virginity now? remember a loose-bodied
Gown wench, and let it go, wires, and tyres, bents and bums, felts and falls,
thou that shall deceive the world, that Gentlewomen indeed shall not be known
from others; I have a master to whom I must prefer thee, after the aforesaid
decking, Lethe by name, a man of one most admired property, he can both love
thee and for thy better advancement be thy Pandar himself, an exlent spark of
humility


Well heaven forgive you, you train me up to it.


Why I do acknowledge it, and I think I do you a pleasure in it.


And if I should prove a harlot now, I should be bound to curse you.


Bound? nay and you prove a harlot, you will be loose enough.


If I had not a desire to go like a gentlewoman, you should be hanged, ere you
should get me to it I warrant you


Nay that's certain, nor a 1000. more of you, I know, you are all chaste enough,
till one thing or other tempt you^ deny a Satin gown and you dare now


You know I have no power to do it, and that makes you so wilful: for what
woman is there such a beast that will deny any thing that is good


True they will not, most dissembler.


No, and she bear a brave mind she will not I warrant you.


Why, therefore take heart, faint not at all,
Women nere rise, but when they fall,
Let a man break, he is gone, blown up,
A woman's breaking sets her up,
Virginity is no City -- Trade,
You're out a'th Freedom, when you're a maid,
Down with the lattis it is but thin,
Let courser beauties work within:
Whom the light mocks, thou art fair and fresh,
The gilded flies, will light upon thy flesh.

Beshrew your sweet enchantments, you have wun.

How easily soft women are undone:
So farewell wholesome weeds where treasure pants,
And welcome silks, where lies disease and wants:
Come wench, now flow thy Fortunes in to bless thee,
I Will bring thee where thou shall be taught to dress thee!

Oh as soon as may be, I am in a swone till I be a gentlewoman, and you know
what flesh is man's meat, tell it be dressed


Most certain, no more a woman.


Gentlemen I ha sworn I Will change the room: dice?


You see I Am patient gentlemen*


I, the feinds in it, you're patient, you put up all. Devils.


Come set me gentlemen!


An Essexgenrleman sir.


An unfortunate one sir.


Indeed sir.


He Is second to my bosom.


I Will give you that comfort then sir, you must not want money as long as you are
in town sir


No sir?


I am bound in my love to him to see you furnished, and in that comfort I
recover my salute again sir


Then I desire to be more dear unto you.


I rather study to be dear unto you -- boy, fill some wine. -- I knew not what
fair impressier I receiud, at first, but I began to affect your society very
speedily


I count my self the happier.


To master Alsup sir, to whose remembrance, I could love to drink till I were
past remembrance


I shall keep Christmasse with him sit, where your health shall likewise
undoubtedly be remembered, and thereupon I pledge you: -- I would sue for your
name sir


Your suite shall end in one Term sir: my name is Blastfield.


Kind master Blastfield, your deerer acquaintance.


Nay come, will ye draw in Gentlemen? set me:


Faith I Am scatterd.


Sir, you shall not give out so meanly of your self in my company for a
Million: make Such privy to your disgrace? you are a Gentleman of fair
fortunes; keep me your reputation; set 'em all, there is crowns fo you


Sir you bind me infinitely in these courtesies.


You must always have a care of your Reputation here in Town master Easy,
although you ride down with nothing, it skils not


I Am glad you tell me that yet, then IN,e indifferent. Well, come: who
throws? I set all these


Why, well said.


This same master Lethe here begins to undo us again.


Ah sir, I came not hither but to win.


And then you will leave us, that's your fashion.


He Is base that visits not his friends:


But he is more base taht carries out his winnings.
None will do so but those have base beginnings

It is a thing in use and ever was, I pass this time.


I wonder you should pass. And that you're sufferd.


Tut, the Dice are ours,
Then wonder not at those that have most powrs*

The Devil and his Angels.


Are these they? Welcome dear Angels, where you are cursed nere stay.


Here Is luck.


Lets search him Gentlemen, I think he wears a smock:


I knew the time, he wore not half a shirt, just like a Pee.


No, how did he for the Rest?


Faith he compounded with a couple of Napkins at Barnet, and so trus'd up the
lower parts


It Was a pretty shift in faith.


But master Lethe has forgot that too.


A mischief on it to loose all: I could --


Nay but good Ma Easy, do not do your self that tirannie I beseech you, I must
not ha you alter your body now for the Purge of a little money: you undo me
and you do


It Was al I brought up with me, I protest master Blastsield, all my rent till
next quarter


Pox of money, talk not on it I beseech you, what said I to you? Mass I am out
of cash my self too, -- Boy


Anon sir.


Run presently to master Gum the Mercer, and will him to tell out two or three
hundred pound for me, or more according as he is furnished: I Will visit him ith
morning say


It shall be said sir.


Do you hear boy?


Yes sir.


If master Gum be not sufficiently ready, call upon master Profit the
Goldsmith


It shall be done sir.


Boy.


I know I was not sent yet now is the time.


Let them both rest till another occasion: you shall not need to run so far
at this time, take one nier hand go to Ma. Quomodo the Draper, and will him to
furnish me instantly


Now I go sir.


It seems you are well known master Blastfield, and your credit very spacious
here ith City


Master Easy, let a man bear himself portly, the whorsons will creep to him
a'th their bellies, and their wives a'th their backs: there is a kind of bold
grace expected throughout all the parts of a Gentleman: then for your
obseruances, a man must not so much as spit but within line and fashion. I tell
you what I ha done: sometimes I carry my water all London over, only to
deliver it proudly at the Standard, and do I pass altogether unnoted think
you? No, a man can no sooner peep out his head, but there is a bow bent at him
out of some watch tower, or other


So readily sir.


Push, you know a bowe's quickly ready, tho a Gun belong a charging, and will
shoot five times to his once, Come, you shall bear your self Iouially: take
heed of setting your looks to your losses, but rather smile upon your ill
luck, and inuit 'em to morrow to another breakefast of Bones


Nay i will forswear dicing.


What? peace? I am ashamed to hear you: will you cease in the first loss,
show me one Gentleman that ere did it? Fie vppon't I must use you to company
I perceive, youde be spoilde else: forswear Dice? I would your friends heard
you in faith


Nay I was but in jest sir.


I hope so, what would Gentlemen say of you? there goes a Gull that keeps his
money, I would not have such a report go on you, for the World as long as you
are in my company. Why man fortune alters in a Minute, I ha known those have
recovered so much in an hour, their purses were never sick after


Oh worse then consumption of the Liver! consumption of the patrimony.


How now? mark their humors master Easy.


Forgive me, my poste^itie, yet vngotten.


That's a penitent Maudlen Dicer.


Few know the sweets that the plain life allows. Vilde son that surfets of
his fathers brows


Laugh at him master Easy.


Ha, ha ha.


I Will be damned and these be not the bones of some queen that couzened me in
her life, and now consumes me after her death


That's the true-wicked-blasphemous, and soul-shuddering Dicer, that will curse
you all service time, and attribute his ill luck always to one Drab or other


Dick, Hell-gill: the hapie News.


I have her for you sir.

Peace, what is she?


Young, beautiful and plump. -- a delicate piece of sin.


Of what parentage?


Oh a Gentlewoman of a great house.


Fie, fie.


She newly came out of a Barn; yet too good for a Tooth-drawers son.


Is she wife or maid?


That which is dantiest, Maid


I Would rather she would been a wife.


A wife sir, why?


Oh Adultery is a great deal sweeter in my mind.


Diseases gnaw thy bones. I think she has deserud to be a wife sir.


That will move well.


Her firstlinge shall be mine. Swine look but for the husks, the meat be
thine


How now Boy?


Master Quomodo takes your worships greeting exceeding kindly, and in his
commendations returns this answer, that your worship shall not be so apt to
receive it, as he willing to lend it


Why, we thank him in faith.


Troth, and you ha reason to thank him sir, it was a very friendly answer.


Push, a Gentleman that keeps his days even here ith City (as I my self watch
to do) shall have many of those answers in a tweluemonth, master Easy


I promise you sir I admire your carriage, and begin to hold a mor reu'rend
respect of you


Not so I beseech you, I give my friends leave to be inward with me, -- will
you walk Gentlemen


Wee're for you. Present her with this Jewel my first token.


There are certain Countrymen without enquiring for master Rerage, and
master Salewood


Tennants!


Thou reuiu'st us Rascal.


When Is our next meeting Gentlemen?


To morrow night, This Gentleman, by me inuites you all, Do you not Master
Easy


Freely sir.


We do embrace your love -- a pure fresh Gull


Thus make you men at parting duetifull, And rest beholding to you, it is the
slight To be remembered, when you are out of sight


A pretty virtue.


Where shall I seek her now? -- oh if she knew The Dangers that attend on
women's lives, She would rather lodge under a poor thatcht Roof Then under
carved seelings: she was my joy, And all content that I received from life, My
dear and only Daughter: What says the Note she left, let me again With
stayeder grief peruse it -- Father? wonder not at my so sudden departure,
without your leave or knowledge, thus under pardon I excuse it, had you had
knowledge of it, I know you would have sought to restrain it, and hinder me
from what I have long desirde, being now happilye preferred to a Gentleman's
service in London; about Holborne, if you please to send, you may hear well of
me --

As false as she is disobedient,
Iy'e made larger inquiry, left no place
(Where Gentry keeps) unsought, yet cannot hear,
Which drives me most into a shameful fear:
Woe worth the infected cause that makes me visit
This man-deuouring City -- where I spent
My unshapen youth, to be my ages curse,
And surfetted away my name and state,
In swinish Riots, that now being sober,
I do awake, a Beggar, -- I may hate her.
Whose youth voides wine, his age is cursed with water,
Oh heavens! I know the price of ill, too well,
What, the confusions are in whom they dwell,
And how soon Maids are to their Ruins won
One minute, and aeternally undone:
So in mine may it: may it not be thus? --
Though she be poor, her honors preceous,
May be my present form, and her foud fear,
May chase her from me, if her eye should getme,
And therefore as my love and wants advise.
I Will serve until I find her in disguise.
Such is my care to fright her from base evils
I leave calm state to live amongst you, devils.

Were these fit words think you to be sent to any Citizens wise, to enjoy
the Daughter, and love the mother too for a need? I would foulye scorn that
man, that should love me only for a need I tell you: and here the Knave
writes again, that by the marriage of my Daughter, a has the better means and
opportunity to my self, he lies in his Throat like a villain, he has no
opportunity of me, for all that, it is for his betters to have opportunity of
me, and that he shall well know -- a base proud knave -- a has forgot how he
came up, and brought two of his country men to give their words to my husband
for a suit of green Karsey, a has forgot all this, and how does he appear to
me, when his white Satin suttes on, but like a Magot crept out of a Nutshell,
a fair body and a foul neck, those parts that are covered of him, looks
indifferent well, because we cannot see them else for all his clensing, pruning
and paring, he is not worthy a Brokers Daughter, and so tell him


I will indeed forsooth.


And as for my Child, I hope she will be ruld in Time, though she be folish yet
and not be carried away with a cast of Manchets, a Bottle of wine, or a
Custard, and so I pray certify him


He do your errant effectually.


Art thou his Ant -- or his --


Alas -- I am a poor drudge of his.


Faith and thou were his Mother, he would make thee his drudge I warrant him.


Marry out upon him, sir reverence of your mistrisship


Here Is somewhat for thy pains, fare thee well.


It Is more then he gave me since I came to him.


How now, what prating have we hear? whispers, dumshowes? why Tomazin, goo too
-- my shop is not altogether so dark as some of my neighbors, where a man may
be made Cuckold at one end, while he is measuring with his yard at the other


Only commendations sent from Master Lethe your worshipful Son in law that
should be


Oh, and that you like not* he that can make us rich in custom, strong in
friends, happy in suites, bring us into all the romes a sundaies, from the
leads to the seller, pop us in with Venison til we crack again, and send home
the rest in an honorable Napkin -- this man you like not forsooth


But I like him father.


My blessing go with thy liking


A number of our Citizens hold our credit by it to come home drunk, and say we
ha been at Court: then how much more credit is it to be drunk there indeed


Tut, thy Mothers a fool -- pray what is Master Rerage whom you plead for so?


Why, first he is a Gentleman.


I, he is often first a Gentleman that is last a beggar.


My father tells you true, what should I do with a gentleman, I know not which
way to lie with him


It Is truetoo -- thou know beside, we undo Gentlemen daily


That makes so few of them marry with our Daughters, unless it be one green
foot or other* next, M. Rerage has land and living, the other but his walk in the
street, and his snatching diet, he is able to entertain you in a fair house
of his own, the other in some nooke or corner, or place us behind the cloth like
a company of Puppe^s: at his house you shall be served curiously, sit down
and eat your meat with leisure, there we must be glad to take it standing,
and without either salt, cloth, or trencher, and say we are befriended too


Oh, that gives a Citizen a better appetite then his Garden.


So say I Father, me thinks it does me most good when I take it standing, I
know not how all women's minds are


Faith I think they are al of thy mind for that thing, how now Falslight?


I have descri'd my fellow Short-yard, alias Blastfield, at hand with the
Gentleman


Oh my sweet Short-yard! -- Daughter, get you up to your Virginalls: by your
leave Mistress Quomodo


Why I hope I may sitith shop, may I not?


That you may, and welcome sweet hony-thye, but not at this season, there is a
Buck to be struck


Well, since i am so expressly forbidden, i will watch above ith gallerie, but i will
see your knauerie


Be you preparde as I tell you.


You near feared me:


Oh that sweet, neat, comely, proper, delicate parcel of land, like a fine
Gentlewoman ith waste: not so great as pretty, pretty: the Trees in Summer
whistling, the silver waters by the Banks harmoniouslye gliding, I should have
been a Scholar, an excellent place for a student: fit for my Son that
lately commenced at Cambridge, whom now I have placed at Innes of Court: Thus
we that sildome get Lands honestly, must leave our heirs to inherit our
knauerie: but whist, one turn about my shop and meet with them


Is this it sir?


I, let me see, this is it: sign of three Knaves, it is it^


Do you hear sir, what lack you Gentlemen? see good Kersies or broad
clothes here, I pray come near -- Master Blastfield


I thought you would know me anon.


You Are exceeding welcome to Town sir, your worship must pardon me, it is always
mistie weather in our shops here: we are a Nation the Sun ^ere shines upon,
-- Came this Gentleman with you


O salute him fairly, he is a kind Gentleman, a very in ward of mine.


Then I cry you mercy sir, you are especially welcome.


I return you thanks sir.


But how shall I do for you now Master Blastfield?


Why what is the matter?


It is my greatest affliction at this instant, I am not able to furnish you.


How master Quomodo, pray say not so, sl'ud you undo me then.


Upon my Religion Master Blastfield, bonds lie forfeete in my hands, I expect
the receite of a thousand every hour, and cannot yet set eye of a penny


That Is strange me thinks.


It Is mine own pity that plots against me Master Blastfield, they know I
have no conscience to take the for feture, and that makes em so bold with my
mercy


I am sorry for this.


Never the less, if I might entreat your delay but the age of three days to
express my sorrow now, I would double the sum, and supply you with four or
five hundred


Let me see, -- three days.


I good sir, and it may be possible.


Do you hear Master Blastfield,


Ha?


You know i have already enuited all the Gallants to sup with me to night.


That Is true in faith.


T will be my everlasting shame, if I have no monye to maintain my bounty.


I nere thought upon that -- I looked still when that should come from him, we
have strickly examined our expenses, it must not be three days Master Quomodo


No the^ 'me afraid twill be my grief sir.


Master Blastfield, i will tell you what you may do now.


What good sweet bedfellow.


Send to Master Goome, or Master Profit, the Mercer and Goldsmith.


Mass that was well remembered of thee -- I perceive the Trout will be a
little troublesome ere he be caught -- Boy. (...) Boy* Here sir


Run to Master Goome, or Master Profit, and carry my present occasion of
money to em


I run sir.


Me thinks Master Blastfield, you might easily attain to the satisfaction of
3. days, here is a Gentleman your friend I dare say will see you sufficiently
possessed till then


Not I sir, by no means: master Blastfield knows I Am further in want then
himself, my hope rests all upon him, it stands upon the loss of my credit to
Night, if I walk without money


Why master Quomodo, what a fruitless Motion have you put forth, you might
wel^ assure your self this gentleman had it not if I wanted it: why our purses
are brothers we desire but equal fortunes: in a word we are man and wife, they
can but lie together, and so do we


As nere as can be in faith.


And to say truth, it is more for the continuing of this Gentleman's credit in
Town then any incitement from mine own want only, that I count to be so
immediately furnish^ -- you shall hear him confess as much himself


It Is most certain master Quomodo.


Oh here comes the Boy now: How now Boy, what says master Goome, or master
Profit


Sir, thei'r both walk forth this frostie morning to Brainford, to see a
Nurse-childe


A Bastard be it, spite and shame.


Nay, never vex your self sweet master Blastfield.


Bewitched I think.


Do you hear sir? you can persuade with him.


A little sir.


Rather then he should be altogether destitute, or be too much a vexation to
himself, he shall take up a commodity of cloth of me tell him


Why la! by my troth to was kindly spoken.


Two hundred pounds worth upon my Religion say.


So disastrously.


Nay, master Blastfield, you do not hear what master Quomodo said since,
like an honest true Citizen in faith: rather then you should grow diseasde
upon it, you shall take up a commodity of two hundred pounds ^orth of cloth


The mealie Moth consume it, would he hame turn Peddler now? what should I do
with cloth


He Is a very wilful Gentleman at this Time in faith: he knows as well what to
do with it, as I my self Iwis: there is no Merchant in Town but will be greedy
upon it, and pay down money vpo'th nail, the'l dispatch it over to
Middle-borrow presently, and raise double commodity by exchange, if not, you
know it is Tearme-time, and Michaelmas Term too, the Drapers harvest, for
footcloaths, riding suts, walking suits, chamber gowns, and hall gowns


Nay, I Will say that, it comes in as fit a time as can be.


Nay take me with you again ere you go sir, I offer him no trash (...) him, but
present money, say, where I know some Gentlemen in town ha been glad, and are
glad at this time, to take up commodities in Hawks hoods, and brown paper


Oh horrible, are there such fool^s in town?


I offer him no trash tell him, upon my Religion you may say, -- Now my sweet
Shortyand, -- now the hungry fish begins to nibble: one end of the worm is in
his mouth in faith


Why stand I here (as late our graceless Dames
That found no eyes) to see that Gentleman
Al^ue in state and cred^^ (...)
Help to rip up himself does all he can,
Why am I wife to him that is no man?
I suffer in that Gentleman's confusion.

Nay be persuaded in that master Blastfield it is ready money at, the (...)
beside, the (...) and all falls in as pa^ as can be (...) help it


Well Master Easy, none but you could have persuaded me to that, come, would
you would dispatch then Master Quomodo, where is this cloth


Full and whole within, all of this piece of my Religion Master Blastfield,
feel't, nay feel't and spare not, Gentlemen! your fingers and your judgment


Clothe's good.


By my tro^h exceeding good cloth, a good wale t'as,


Falslight.


I Am near out 'athe shop sir.


Go, call in a Porter presently to carry away the cloth with the Star
mark, whither will you please to have it carried Master Blastfield


Faith to Master Beggar-land, he is the only Merchant now: or his Brother
Master Stilliard-downe, there is little difference


You Have happened upon the money men sir, they and some of their Brethren I can
tell you, will not stick to offer thirty thousand pound to be cursed still,
great monyed men, their stocks lie in the Poores throats: but you will see me
sufficiently discharged Master Blastfield ere you depart


You have always found me righteous in that.


Falslight.


Sir.


You may bring a Scriuener along with you.


I Will remember that sir.


Have you sent for a Citizen Master Blastfield.


No faith not yet -- Boy!


What must you do with a Citizen sir?


A custom they are bound to alate by the default ofeuill debtors, no Citizen
must lend money without two be bound in the bond, the second Man enters but
for custom sake


No, and must he needs be a Citizen?


Byth mass stay, i will learn that Master Quomodo!


Sir.


Must the second party that enters into bond only for fashions sake needs be
a Citizen? what say you to this Gentleman for one


A less sir, you know he is a mere stranger to me, I neither am sure of his
going or abiding, he may Inn here to Night, and ride away to morrow,
(although I grant the chief burden lies upon you) yet we are bound to make
choice of those we know sir


Why he is a Gentleman of a pretty living sir.


It may be so: yet under both your pardons I Would rather have a Citizen.


I hope you will not disparadge me so? it is well known I have three hundred pound
a year in Essex


Well said, to him thy self, take him up roundly.


And how doubtfullie so ere you account of me, I do not think but I might
make my bond pass for a hundred pound'ith City


What alone sir?


Alone sir: who says so? perhaps i would send down for a Tennant or too.


I, that is another case sir.


Another case let it be then.


Nay, grow not into anger sir.


Not take me into a Bond, as good as you shall good man Goose-cap.


Well Master Blastfield, because I will not disgrace the Gentleman, i am content
for once, but we must not make a practice on it


No sir, now you would you shall not.


Cuds me, i am undone, he is gone again.


The Netts broke.


Hold there dear Gentleman.


Deny me that small curtizie? s'foot a very Jew will not deny it me.


Now must I catch him warily.


A jest indeed, not take me into a Bond quo they.


Master Easy -- Mark my words, if it stood not upon the eternal loss of
thy credit against Supper --


Mass that is true.


The pawning of thy horse for his own Vittailes.


Right in faith.


And thy utter dissolution amongst Gentlemen for e^^er.


Pox on it.


Quomodo should hang, rot, stink.


Sweet boy in faith.


Drop Dam.


Excellent Shortyard.


I forgot all this: what meant I to ^wagger before I had money in my purse? how
does master Quomodo? is the Bond ready


Oh sir.


Come we must be friends, here is my hand.


Give it the Scriuener: here he comes.


Good day Master Quomodo, good morrow Gentlemen.


We must require a little aid from your pen, good master Dustbox.


What be the Gentlemen's names that are bound sir?


Master John Blastfield Esquireith wild of Kent, and what do they call your
bed f^llowes name


Master Richard Easy: you may easily hit on it.


Master Richard Easy of Essex Gentleman, both bound to Ephestian Quomodo
Citizen and Draper of London: the sum two hundred pound. What Time do you
take master Blastfield for the payment


I never pass my Month you know.


I know it sir. October sixteenth to day, sixteenth of November say.


Is it your custom to return so soon sir?


I never miss you.


I am come for the rest of the same price master Quomodo.


Star-marke, this is it, are all the rest gone?


Thei'r all at Master Stilyard downs by this time.


How the poor raskall's all in a froth?


Push, their ordaind to sweat for Gentlemen, -- Porters backs and women's
bellies bear up the world


It Is true in faith, they bear men and money, and that is the world.


Ye'aue found it sir.


I Am ready to your hands Gentlemen.


Come Master Easy.


I beseech you sir.


It shall be yours I say.


Nay pray master Blastfield.


I will not in faith.


What do you mean sir?


I should show little bringing up, to take the way of a stranger.


By my troth you do your self wrong tho master Blastfield.


Not a whit sir.


But to avoid strife, you shall have your will of me for once.


Let it be so I pray.


Now I begin to set one foot upon the land, me thinks I am felling of
Trees already, we shall have some Essex Loggs yet to keep Christmasse with,
and that is a comfort


Now is he quarting out the Executioner.
Strides over him: with his own blood he writes:
I am no Dame that can endure such sights.

So his right wing is cut, will not fly far
Past the two City hazards, Poultrie, and Woodstreete.

How like you my Roman hand in faith?


Exceeding well sir, but that you rest too much upon your R. and make your ease
too little


I Will mend that presently.


Nay it is done now, past mending: you both deliver this to master Quomodo as
your deed


We do sir.


I thank you Gentlemen,


Would the Coin would come away now, we have deserved for it


By your leave a little Gentlemen.


How now? what is the matter? speak?


As fast as I can sir -- All the clothes come back a^ genesis


How?


What Is the news?


The passage to Middle borrow is stopped, and therefore neither Master Still
yard-downe, nor Master Beggerland, nor any other Mercha^t will deliver present
money vppon't


Why what hard luck have you Gentlemen?


Why Master Blastfield?


Pish --


You Are so discontented too presently, a man cannot tell how to speak to you?


Why what would you say?


We must make some what on it now sir.


I where? how? the best is it lies all upon my neck, Master Quomodo, can you
help me to any money fort? spea


Troth Master Blastfield, since my self is so unfurnished, I know not the
means how, there is one 'ith street a new setter up, if any lay out money
vppon't twill be he


His name:


Master Idem -- but you know we cannot give but greatly to your loss, because
we gain and live by it


Sfoo't will he give any thing.


I, stand upon that.


Will he give any thing? -- the Brokers will give nothing? to no purpose.


Falslight.


Over your head sir.


Desire Master Idem to come presently and look vppo'th cloth.


I will sir.


What if he should offer but a hundred pound?


If he want twenty on it lets take it.


Say you so?


Master Quomodo we will have four or five hundred pound for you of his own
within three or four days


It Is true, he said so indeed.


Is That your wife master Quomodo?


That Is she, little Tomazin?


Under your leave sir, i will show my self a Gentleman.


Do, and welcome Master Easy.


I have commission for what I do Lady from your Husband.


You may have a stronger commission for the next, an't please you, that is from
my self


You teach me the best law Lady.


Beshrew my blood, a proper, springfull, and a sweet Gentleman.


My Son: Sim Quomodo? here is more work for you Master Easy, you must
salute him too, for he is like to be heir of thy land I can tell thee


Vim, vitam, sprinque salutem.


He shows you there he was a Cambridge man sir, but now he is a Templer, has
he not good grace to make a Lawyer


A very good grace to make a Lawyer.


For indeed he has no grace at all.


Some gave me counsel to make him a Divine.


Fie, fie.


But some of our liuerie think it an unfit thing, that our own Sons should
tell us of our vices: others, to make him a Physician, but then being my heir,
i am afraid he would make me away: now a Lawyer thei'r all willing too,
because it is good for our trade and increases, the number of Cloath-gownes, and
indeed it is the fittest for a Citizens Son, for our word is, what do ye
lack? and their word is what do you give


Exceeding propper.


Master Idem welcome.


I have seen the cloth sir.


Very well.


I am but a young setter up, the uttermost I dare ventture upon it is
threescore pound


What?


If it be for me, so, I am for it: if not, you have your does and I have my
money


Nay, pray master Blastfield refuse not his kind offer.


A bargain then master Idem, clap hands -- he is finely cheated: come, let us
all to the next Tavern and see the money paid


A match.


I follow you Gentlemen, take my Son along with you.

Now to my keys: ^^me Master Idem, he must fetch the money, first have I
caught him in a bond for two hundred pound, and my two hundred pounds worth a
doath again for threescore pound: admire me all you studyents at Innes for
cousenage


You talk of an alteration, here is the thing it self, what base birthe does
not raiment make glorious? and what glorious birthes do not ^agges make
infamous? why should not a woman confess what she is now? fince the finest are
but deluding shadows, begot between Tyr^^omen and Tailors? for instance,
behold their Parents


Say what you will, this wire becomes you best, how say you Tailor?


I promise you it is a wire would draw me from my work seven days a week.


Why do you work a sundaies Tailor?


Hardest of al a Sundaie, because we are most forbidden


Troth and so do most of us women, the better day the better deed we think.


Excellent exceeding in faith, a narrow card wire sets out a cheek so fat and so
full, and if you be ruled by me, you shall wear your hair still like a
Mock-face behind, it is such an Italian world, many men know not Before from
Behind


How like you the sitting of this gown now Mistress Comings?


It sits at marvelous good Ease, and comely discretion.


Who would think now this fine Sophisticated squal came out of the Bosom of a
Barn, and the loins of a Haytosser


Out you saucy pestiferous Pander, I scorn that in faith.


Excellent, already the true phrase and style of a strumpet, stay, a little
more of the red, and then I take my leave of your Cheek for four and twenty
hours -- Do you not think it impossible that her own Father should know her
now, if he saw her


Why I think no less, how can he know me, when I scarce know my self.


It Is right.


But so well you lay wait for a man for me.


I protest I have bestowed much labor about it, and in fit Time, good news I
hope


1 Iu'e found one yet at last, in whose preferment I hope to reap credit.

Is that the fellow?

1 Lady it is.


Art thou willing to serve me fellow?


So please you, he that has not the heart to serve such a Mistress as your
beautiful self, deserves to be honored for a fool, or Knighted for a Coward


There Is to many of them already.


Twere sin then to raise the number.


Well, we will try both our likings for a month, and then either proceed, or
let fall the suite


Be it as you have spoke, but it is my hope A longer Term.


No truly, our Term ends once a month, we should get more then the
Lawyers, for they have but four Terms a year, and we have twelve, and that
makes them run so fast to us in the Vacation


A mistress of of a choice beauty, amongst such imperfect creatures I ha not
seen a perfecter: I should have reckoned the fortunes of my Daughter amongst
the happiest, had she lighted into such a service, whereas now I rest doubt
full, whom or where she serves


There Is for your bodily advice Tailor, and there is for your head-counsell, and
I discharge you both till to morrow morning again


At which time our neatest Attendance.


I pray have an especial care howsoever you stand or lie, that nothing fall
upon your hair to batter your wire


I warrant you for that -- which Gown becomes me best now, the purple Satin
or this


If my opinion might rule over you --


Come gallants, i will bring you to a Beauty shall stricke your eyes into your
hearts, what you see you shall desire, yet never enjoy


And that is a Villainous torment.


And is she but your vnderput Master Lethe?


No more of my credit, and a Gentlewoman of a great house, Noble parentage,
unmatchable Education, my plain Pung. I may, grace her with the name of a
Curtizan, a Backslider, a Prostitution, or such a Toy, but when all comes ^o al
it is but a plain Pung, look you Gentlemen, that is she, behold her


Oh my beloved strayer! I consume in thy absence.


La you now -- you shall not say i will be proud to you Gentlemen, I give you
leave to salute her* I me afraid of nothing now, but that she will utterly
disgrace them, turn tail to them, and place their kisses behind her, no by my
faith, she deceiues me, by my troth sha's kissed am both with her lips: I thank
you for that music masters, sli'd they both court her at once, and see if she
ha not the wit to stand still and let them: I think if two men were brewde into
one, there is that woman would drink them up both


A Cockscombe, he a Courtier.


He says he has a place there.


So has the Fool a better place then he, and can come where he dare not show
his head


Nay, he are you me Gentlemen.


I protest you were the last man we spoke on, we are a little busy yet, pray
stay there a while, we will come to you presently


This is good in faith, endure this and be a slave forever, since you neither
savor of good breeding nor bringing up, I Will slice your hamstrings but i will make
you show mannerly -- pox on you, leave courting, I ha not the heart to hurt an
Englishman in faith, or else --


What else?


Prithee lets be merry, nothing else -- here, fetch some wine.


Let my Servant go for it.


Yours, which is he?


This sir, but I scarce like my Mistress now: the loins can nere be safe where
the Flies be so busy -- Wit by experience bought foyles wit at School: Who
proves a deeper knave then a Spent fool, I am gone for your worships wine sir


Sir, you put up too much indignity, bring company to cut your own throat,
the fire is not yet so hot, that you need two Screenes before it, it is but new
kindled yet, if twere risse to a flame, I could not blame you the^ to put
others before you but alas all the heat yet is comfortable a cherrisher, not
a defacer


Prithee let them alone, they will be ashamed o^t anon I troe, if they have any
grace in 'em


I Would feign have him quarrel, fight, and be assuredlye killed, that I might beg
his place: for there is nere a one void yet


You Will make him mad anon.


It Is to that end.


Yet at last, Master Quomodo is as firm as his promise.


Did I not tell you still he would.


Let me see, I am seven hundred pound in bond now to the Rascal.


Nay you are no less Master Blastfield, look to it, by my troth, I must needs
confess sir, you ha been vncommonly kind to me, since I ha been in Town,
but master Alsup shall know on it


That Is my Ambition sir.


I beseech you sir. Stay, this is Lethes haunt, see, we have caught him.


Master Blastfield and Master Easy, you are kind Gentlemen both.


Is that the beauty you famde so?


The same.


Who be those so industrious about her?


Rerage and Salewood: ^le tell you the vnmannerlyest trick of them, that ever
you heard in your life


Prithee what is that?


I ^nuyfed them hither to look upon her, brought them along with me, gave them
leave to salute her in kindness, what do they but most sawcilie fall in love
with her, very impudently court her for themselves, and like two craftye
Atturneyes, finding a hole in my lease, go about to defeat me of my right


Ha they so little conscience?


The most vnciuilst part that you have seen, I know they will be sorry for it
when they have done, for there is no man but gives a sigh after his sin of women,
I know it by my self


You parcel of a rude, saucy and unmannerly nation.


One good thing in him, heel tell them ont roundly.


Cannot a Gentleman purchase a little fire to thawe his appetite by, but must
you that have been daily sindg'd in the flame, be as greedy to beguile him
on it? how can it appear in you but maliciously, and that you go about to
engrosse hell to your selves? he auen forbid, that you should not suffer a
stranger to come in, the Devil himself is not so unmannerly, I do not think
but some of them rather will be wise enough to beg* Offices there before you,
and keep you out, marry all the spite will be they cannot sell them again


Come, are you not to blame -- not to give place? -- To us I mean --


A worse and a worse disgrace.


Nay Gentlemen, you wrong us both then, stand from me, I protest i will draw my
silver Bodkin upon you


Clubs, clubs, -- Gentlemen stand upon your Guard.


A Gentlewoman must swagger a little now and then I perceive, there would be
no civility in her Chamber else, though it be my hard fortune to have my
keeper there a coward, the thing that is kept is a Gentlewoman borne


And to conclude a Coward, infallible of your side, why do you think in faith I
took you to be a Coward? do I think you will turn your back to any man
living? you will be whipped first


And then indeed she turns her back to some man living.


But that man shows himself a Knave, for he dares not show his own face
when he does it, for some of the common Counsel in Henry the eights days
thought it modesty at that time, that one Vizzard should look upon another


It Was honestly considered of them in faith.


How now? what piece of stuff comes here?


Now some good news yet to recover my Repute, and grace me in this company;
Gentlemen, are we friends among our selves


Vinited.


Then here comes Reuish to confirm our Amity -- Wag* tail, salute them all
they are friends


Then saving my quarrel to you all.


Toe's all


Now be shrowe your hearts, and you do not.


To sweet Master Lethe.


Let it flow this way dear Master Blastfield, Gentlemen to you all.


This Re^ish wine is like the scowring-sticke to a gun, it makes the Barrel
clear: it has an excelent virtue, it keeps all the Sinckes in man and woman's
body sweet in June and July, and to say truth, if Ditches were not cast once
a year, and Drabs once a Month, there would be no abiding in the City


Gentlemen, i will make you privy to a letter I sent.


A letter comes well after privy, it makes amends.


There Is one Quomodo* a Drapers Daughter in town whom for her happy portion
I wealthily affect


And not for love? this makes for me his Rival, bear witness.


The Father does elect me for the man, The Daughter says the same.


Are you not well?


Yes all but for the mother, she is my sickness.


Birlady and the Mother is a pestilent, wilful, troublesome sickness I can
tell you, if she light upon you handsomlye


I find it so: she for a stranger pleades: Whose name I ha not learned.


And ene now he called me by it.


Now as my letter told her, since only her consent kept aloof of, what might
I think on it, but that she merely dooted upon me herself


Very assuredly.


This makes still for you.


Did you let it go so in faith?


You may believe it sir, now what says her answer?


I, her answer.


She says you are a base proud knave, and like your worship.


How?


Nay, hear out her answer, or there is no goodness in you.


You ha forgot she says in what pickle your worship came up, and brought two
of your friends to give their words for a suit of green Kersye


Drudge, peace, or --


Show your self a Gentleman, she had the patience to read your letter which
was as bad as this can be, what will she think on it, not hear her answer?
speak, good his drudge


And as for her Daughter, she hopes she will be ruled by her in time, and not be
carried away with a cast of Manchets, a bottle of Wine, and a Custard, which
once made her Daughter sick, because you came by it with a bad conscience


Gentlemen, i am all in a sweat.


That Is very wholesome for your body, nay you must keep in your arms.


Then she demanded of me whether I was your worships Ant or no?


Out, out, out, Gru. Alas said I, I am a poor drudge of his.


Faith and thou were his Mother (quoth she) heed make thee his Dru dge I
warrant him --

Marry out upon him (quoth I) an't like your worship.

Horror, horror, i am smothered, let me go, torment me not.


And you love me, lets follow him Gentlemen.


Agreed.


I count a hundred pound well spent to pursue a good jest Master Easy.


By my troth I begin to bear that mind too.


Well said in faith, hang money-good jests are worth silver at all times.


They Are worth gold Master Blastfield.


Do you deceive me so? are you toward marriage in faith Master Lethe it shall
go hard but i will forbid the Banes, i will send a messe^ger into your bones,
another into your pursse but i will do it


Thou fair and wicked Creature, steept in Art,
Beauteous and fresh, the soul the fowlest part.
A common Filth, is like a House possessed,
Where if not spoild, you will come out fraide at least,
This service likes not me, though I rest poor,
I hate the basest use to screene a whore.
The human stroke nere made him, he that can
Be Bawd to Woman, never leapt from man.
Some monster wunne his Mother,
I wished my poor child hither, doubled wrong,
A month and such, a mistress were too long,
Yet here a while in others lives i will see,
How former follyes, did appear in me.

Boy.


Anon sir.


Where left you Master Blastfield your master, say you?


An hour since I left him in Paul's sir -- but you will not find him the same
man again next time you meet him


Methinks I have noe being without his company it is so full of kindenes and
delight, I hold him to be the only Companyon in earth


I, as Companions go now adays that help to spend a man's money.


So full of nimble wit, various discourse, praegnant apprehension, and uncommon
entertainment, he might keep Company with any Lord for his grace


I, with any Lord that were past it.


And such a good free hearted honest, affable kind of Gentleman: Come Boy a
heaviness will possess me till I see him


But you will find your self heauyer then, by a seven hundred pound weight, --
Alas poor Birds that cannot keep the sweet Country, where they slye at
pleasure, but must needs come to London to have their wings clipped, and are
feign to go hopping home again


So, No man is so impudent to deny that -- Spirits can change their shapes,
and soonest of all into Sergeants: because they are Coosen Germans to spirits,
for there is but two kind of arrests till Doomes-day, the Devil for the soul,
the Sergeant for the body, but afterward the devil arrests body and soul
Sergeant and all, if they be knaves still, and deserve it* now my yeoman
^aslight


I Attend you good Serjant Shortyard.


No more master Blastfield now -- poor Easy hardly be set.


But how if he should go to prison, weere in a mad state then, being not
Sergeants


Never let^^ come near thy belee^e that heel take prison, or stand out in
law, knowing the debt to be due, but still expect the presence of Master
Blastfield, kind M. Blastfield, worshipful M Blastfield -- and at the last --


Master Shortyard, master Falslight.


The Boy: a warning-piece, -- see where he comes.


Is not in paul's.


He is not far off sure sir.


When was his hovre say thou?


Two sir.


Why two has struck.


No sir, they are now a striking.


Master Richard Easy of Essex we arrest you.


Ha?


Alas a Surgeon, he is hurt ith shoulder.


Deliver your weapons quietly sir.


Why what is the matter?


You Are arrested at the suite of M. Quomodo.


Master Quomodo?


How strange you make it, you are a landed Gentleman sir, I knew it is but a
trisse, a bond of seven hundred pound


La, I know you had mistook, you should arrest One Master Blastfield, it is
his bond, his debt


Is not your name there?


True, for fashions sake.


Why and it is for fashions sake that we arrest you.


Nay, and it be no more, I yield to that: I know Master Blastfield will see me
take no injury as long as i am in town, for Master Alsups sake


Whose that Sir?


An honest Gentleman in Essex.


Oh, In Essex! I thought you had been in London, where now your business lies,
honestye from Essex will be a great while a coming sir, you should look out
an honest pair of Citizens


Alas sir, I know not where to find them.


No, there is enough in Town.


I know not one by my troth, I am a mere stranger for these parts, Master
Quomodo is all, and the honestest that I know


To him then lets set forward: -- Yeoman Spiderman, castan eye about for
Master Blastfield


Boy -- Alas the poor boy was frighted away at first.


Can you blame him sir -- we that daily fray away Knight's, may fright away
Boys I hope


Ha? have they him say thou?


As sure as --


The land's mine, that's sure enough boy.
Let me advance thee knave, and give thee a kiss,
My pl^t's so firm I dare it now to miss.
Now shall I be diuulgde a landed man,
Throughout the liuerie: -- one points, another whispers,
A third frets inwardly: let him fret and hang,
Especially his envy I shall have,
That would be feign, yet cannot be a knave,
Like an old leather girt in furde Gown,
Whose mind stands stiff but his performance down.
Now come my golden days in: -- whither is the worshipful
master Quomodo, and his fair Bedfellow rid forth,
To his land in Essex? whence comes those goodly load of
Logs? from his land in Essex? where grows this pleasant
fruit, says one Citizens wife in the row; at master Quomodos
Orchard in Essex; oh, oh, does it so, I thank you for
that good news in faith.

Here they come with him sir.


Grant me patience in my joys, that being so great I run not mad with 'em.


Bless master Quomodo.


How now Sergeants? who ha you brought me here, master Easy?


Why la you now Sergeants, did I not tell you you mistook?


Did you not hear me say. I had rather ha had master Blastfield, the more
sufficient man a great deal


Very true sir, -- but this Gentleman lighting into our hands first --


Why did you so sir?


We thought good to make use of that opportunity, and hold him fast.


You did well in that I must needs say, for your own securities, but it was not
my mind master Easy to have you first, you must needs think so


I dare swear that master Quomodo.


But since you are come to me, I have no reason to refuse you, I should show
little manners in that sir


But I hope you spoke not in that sense sir, to impose the bond upon me.


By my troth that is my meaning sir, you shall find me an honest man, you see
I mean what I say, is not the day past, the money vntendred, you would ha me live
uprightly master Easy


Why sir, you know master Blastfield is the man.


Why sir, I know master Blastfield is the man, but is he any more then one man?
two entered into bond to me, or I Am fowly coozn'd


You know my entrance was but for fashion sake.


Why, i will a gree to you, you will grant it is the fashion likewise when the Bond's
due to have the money paid again


So we told him sir, and that it lay in your worships curtezie to arrest which
you please


Marie does it sir, these fellows know the law, -- beside, you offered yourself
into Bond to me you know, when I had no stomach to you, now beshrew your heart
for your labor, I might ha had a good substantial Citizen, that would ha paid
the sum roundly, although I think you sufficient enough for seven hundred
pound, beside the forfeyture, I would be loath to disgrace you so much before
Sergeants


If you would has patience sir, I do not think but master Blasefield is at
Carriers to receive the money


He will prove the honester man then, and you the better discharged, I wonder he
should break with me, it was never his practice, you must not be angry with
me now, tho you were somewhat hot when you entered into Bond, you may easily go
in angerly, but you cannot come out so


No, the Devils in it for that.


Do you here sir, a my troth we pity you, ha you any store of Crowns about
you


Faith a poor store, yet they shall be at their service that will strive to
do me good, -- we were both drunk last night, and ^eer thought upon the bond


I must tell you this, you have fell in to the hands of a most merciless
deuourer, the very gul athe city, should you offer him money, Goods or lands
now, he would rather have your body in prison, he is a such a nature. Eas. Prison
we are undone then


He Is a such a nature, look? -- Let him owe any man a spite^ what is his
course: he will lend him money to day, a purpose to rest him tomorrow


Defend me?


Has at least sixteen at this instant proceeded in both the Counters: some
batchler, some masters, some doctors of captivity of 20. years standing and he
desires nothing more then imprisonment


Would Ma. Blastfield would come away.


I, then things would not be as they are -- what will you say to us if we
procure you two substantial subsidy Citizens to bail you spite on's heart,
and set you at liberty to find out master Blastfield


Sergeant! here, take all, i will be dear to you, do but perform it.


Much.


Enough sweet Sergeant, I hope I understand thee.


I love to prevent the malice of such a rascal, perhaps you might find master
Blastfield to night


Why, we lie together man, there is the jest on it.


Fie. -- and you will seek to secure your bail, because they will be two
Citizens of good account, you must do that for your credit sake


I Will be bound to save them harmless.


A pox on him, you cut his throat then, -- no words.


What Is it you require me master Quomodo?


You know that before this time I hope sir, present money, or present
imprisonment


I told you so.


We nere had money of you.


You had commodities, an't please you


Well, may I not crave so much liberty upon my word, to seek out master
Blastfield


Yes, and you would not laugh at me: we are sometimes Gulls to Gentlemen* I
thank 'em; but Gentlemen are never Gulls to us, I commend 'em


Under your leave master Quomodo, the Gentleman craves the furtherance of an
hour, and it sorts well with our occasion at this time, having a little urgent
business at Guildhall, at which minute we will return, and see what agreement is
made


Nay take him along with you Sergeant.


I Am undone then.


He Is your prisoner; and being safe in your house at your own disposing, you
cannot deny him such a request: beside, he has a little faith in Ma.
Blastfields coming sir


Let me not be too long delaid I charge you.


Not an hour in faith sir.


O master Easy, of all men living I never dream* you would ha done me this
injury: make me would my credit, fail in my commodities, ring my state into
suspicion: for the breaking of your day to me, has broken my day to others


You tell me of that still, which is no fault of mine master Quomodo.


Oh what is a man but his honesty master Easy, and that's a fault amongst most
of us all, -- Mark but this note, I Will give you good counsel now, -- as often
as you give your name to a bond, you must think you christen a child, and take
the charge on it too: for as the one, the bigger it grows the more cost it
requires: so the other the longer it lies, the more charges it puts you too,
only here is the difference a child must be broke, and a bond must not, the
more you break children, the more you keep 'em under: but the more you break
bonds, the more they will leap in your face, and therefore, to conclude, I would
never undertake to be Gossip to that bond which I would not see well brought
up


Say you so sir? -- I Will think upon your counsel hereafter for it.


Ah fool, thou should near ha tasted such wit but that I know it is too
late


The more I grieve:


To put all this into the compass of a little hoop Ring
Make this account, come better days or worse,
So many bonds abroad, so many boys at nurse.

A good medicine for a short memory: -- but since, you have entered so far,
whose children are desperate depts I pray


Faith they are like the of-springs of stolen lust, put to the hospital, their
fathers are not to be found, they are either too far abroad, or too close
within, and thus for your memories sake

The desperate Debtor hence deriues his name,
One that has neither money, land nor fame,
All that he makes, prove Bestards, and not Bonds,
But such as yours, at first are horn^ to lands.

But all that I beget hereafter ^le so one disinherit Master Quomodo.


In the mean time heeres a shrewd knave will disinherit you.


Well, to put you out of all doubt Master Quomodo, i will not trust to your
curtezie, I ha sent for bail


How? you have co^z^ed me there y^aith.


Since the worst comes to the worst, I have those friends 'ith City, I hope
that will not suffer me to lie for seven hundred pound


And you told me you had no friends here at all, how should a man trust you
now


That was but to try your Courtesy M. Quomodo.


How vnco^scionably he gulls himself -- they must be wealthye subsidie-men sir,
at least fortye pound 'ith Kings Books I can tell you, that do such a feate
for you


Here they come what so ere they are.


Berlady Aldermans Deputies, I am very sorrye for you sir, I cannot refuse
such men


Are you the Gentleman in distress?


None more then my self sir.


He speaks truer then he thinks, for if he knew, The hearts that owe those
faces -- a dark shop's good for somewhat


That was all sir.


And that is enough, for by that meanes' you have made your self ^able to the
Bond, as well as that Basefiel


Blastfield sir.


Oh (...) ^ou mercy it is Blastfield indeed.


But under both your worships favors I know where to find him presently.


That Is all your refuge.


News, good news Master Easy.


What boy?


Master Blastfield ^y master ha^ received a tho (...) pound, and will be at
his lodging at supper


Happy^ news, hear you that Master Quomodo?


It Is enough for you to hear that, you are the fortunate man sir.


Not now I beseech your good worships.


Gentleman, what is your to^her name?


Easy.


O Master Easy -- I would we could rather pleasure you otherwise Master
Easy, you should soon perceive it, i will speak a proud word we have pitied
more Gentlemen in distress, then any two Citizens within the freedom -- but
to be bail to sea^en hundred pound action, is a matter of shroud weight


I Will be bound to secure you.


Tut, what is your bond sir?


Body, goods, and Lands, immediately before Master Quomodo.


Shall we venture once again, that have been so often undone by Gentlemen?


I have no great stomach to it, it will appear in us more pity then wisdom.


Why should you say so sir?


I like the Gentleman's face well, he does not look as if he would deceive us.


O not I sir.


Come we will make a desperate voyage once again, we will try his honesty, and
take his single bond, of body Goods and Lands


I dearly thank you sir.


Master Quomodo?


Your worships.


We have took a Course to set your prisoner free.


Your worships are good bail you content me.


Come then, and be a witness to a Re^ullisance.


With all my heart sir.


Master Easy, you must have an especial care now to find out that Blastfield.


I shall have him at my lodging sir.


The (...) will (...) you selse, Master Quomodo will come upon vt, and (...)
you


I know that sir.


Well since I see you have such a good mind to be honest ^e lea^e some
greater (...) sweat with you to find him my self


H^are then my mis^rie ends (...) A strangers kindness often exceedes a friends.


Thou art deceiu^d thy misery but begins,
"To beguile goodness, is the coare of sins.
My love is such unto ^hee, that I die
As often as thou drink'st up (...)*
Yet have no means to warn thee from't, for he
"That sowes in Craft, does rape in Jealousy.

Now the letters made up and all, it wants but the print of a s^ale, and away
it goes to Master Quomodo: Andrew Le^he is well whipped in it, his name stands in
a white sheet here, and do^s penance for him


You have shame enough against him, if that be good.


First as a contempt of that reverend Ceremony, he has in hand, to wit,
marriage


Why do you say to wit marriage, when you know there is none will marry that is
wise


Had it not more need then, to have wit to put to it if it be grown to a
^olly


Y'^ue ^un, i will giue't you.


It Is no thanks now, -- but as I was saying: as a soul contempt to that sacred
ceremony, he most audaciouslye keeps a Drab in town, and to be free from
the interruption of blew Beadles, and other bawdy Officers, he most politickly
lodges her in a Constables house


That Is a pretty point in faith.


And so the wa^ch that should fe^ch her out* are her chiefest guard to keepeher
in


It must needs be for look how the Constable plays his Conscience, the
watchmen will follow the suite


Why well then.


All night from me he is hurt, he is made away.


Where shall we seek him now? you lead me fair ^aunt's sir.


Pray keep a little patience sir, I shall find him at last you shall see.


A Citizen of my e^se and substance to walk so long a foot.


You should ha had my horse but that he has eaten out his head sir.


How would you had me hold him by the tail sir then?


Manners forbid, it is no part of my meaning sir, -- oh here is Master Rerage,
and Master Salewood, now we shall hear of him presently: -- Gntlemen both


Master Easy, how fare you sir?


Very well in health, did you see Master Blastfield this morning?


I was about to move it to you.


We were all three in a mind then.


I ha not set eye on him these two days.


I wonder he keeps so long from us in faith.


I began to be sick.


Why, what is the matter?


Nothing in troth, but a great desire I had to have seen him.


I wonder you should miss on it lately, you are his bedfelow


I lay alone to night in faith, -- I do not know how, O here comes master Lethe,
he can dispatch me: Master Lethe


What Is your name sir? -- O cry you mercy master Easy.


When parted you from master Blastfield sir?


Blastfield's an Ass, I have sought him these two days to beat him.


Your self all alone sir?


I, and three more. --


I am glad, I am where I am then, I perceive it was time of all hands.


Content in faith, let us trace him.


What? have you found him yet? neither? what is to be done now? i will venture my
body no further for any Gentleman's pleasure, I know not how soon I may be
called upon, and now to ouer-heate my self. --


I Am undone.


This is you that slept with him, you can make fools of us, but i will turn you
over to Quomodo fort


Good sir.


I Will prevent mine own danger.


I beseech you sir.


Tho I love Gentlemen well, I do not mean to be undone for 'em.


Pray sir, let me request you sir, sweet sir, I beseech you sir.


Made fools of us! not to be found!


What, what?


Do not undo me quite tho Ma Quomodo.


You Are very welcome, master Easy, I ha nothing to say to you, i will not touch
you, you may go when you please, -- I have good bail here I thank their
worships


What shall I say, or whom shall I beseech*


Gentlemen, S'lid they were borne to undo us I think, but for my part, I Will make
an oath before master Qomodo here, nere to do Gentlemen good while I live


I Will not be long behind you.


Away; if you had any grace in you, you would be ashamed to look us ith face,
ywis I wonder with what browe you can come amongst us, I should seek my
fortunes fa^re enough if I were you, and neither return to Essex, to be a
shame to my predecessors, nor remain about London, to be a mock to my
successors


Subtle Shortyard!


Here are his lands forfeyted to us master Quomodo, and to avoid the
inconscionable trouble of law, all the assi^^ance he made to us, we willingly
resign to you


What shall I do with Rubbish, give me money: It Is for your worships to have
land, that keep great houses, I should be hoysted


But master Quomodo, if you would but conceive it aright, the land would fall
fitter to you then to us


Curtzing about my land.


You have a towardly son and heir as we hear.


I must needs say, he is a Templer indeed.


We have neither posterity in Town nor hope for any abroad; we have wives,
but the marks have been out of their mouths these twenty years, and as it
appears, they did little good when they were in: we could not stand about it
sir, to g^t riches and children too* it is more then one man can do. And I am of
those Citizens minds that say, let our wi^es make shift for children and they
will, they get none of us; and I cannot think, but he that has both much
wealth and many children, has had more helps coming in then himself


I am not a Bow wide of your mind sir. -- And for the thristie and covetous
hopes I have in my son and heir Sim Qmomodo, that he will never trust his
land in Wax and Parchment as many Gentlemen have done before him


Al y-blow for me.


I will honestly discharge you, and recevue it in due form and order of law,
to strengthen it for ever to my son and h^yre, that he may undoubtedly enter
vppon't without the let or molestation of any man, at his or our pleasure
whenever


It Is so assurde unto you.


Why then master Basie you are a freeman sir, you may deal in what you please,
and go whether you will. Why Tomazin, master Easy is dome from Essex, bid
him welcome in a cup of small Bear


Not only vilde, but in it tyrannous.


If it please you sir, you know the house, you may visit us often* and dine
with us once a quarter


Confusion light on you, your wealth and heir,
Worm gnaw your conscience, as the Moth your ware,
I am not the first heir that robbed, or begged.

Excellent excellent, sweet Spirits.


Landed master Quomodo.


Delicate shortyard, commodious Falslight,
Hug and away, shift, shift.
It Is slight, not strength that gives the greatest lift.
Now my desires are full -- for this time,
Men may have Cormorant wishes, but alas
A little thing three hundred pound a year,
Suffices nature, keeps life and soul together,
I Will have 'em l^pt immediately.
I long to warm my self by the wood, -- A fine journey in the Whitsun-holy
days ^yfaith, to ride down with a number of Citizens, and their wives, some
upon pillions, some upon S^de saddles, I, and little Tomazin ith middle our
some and heir S^m Quomodo in a peach color Taffata Iack^t, some hors^^
length, or a long ^ard before us, there will be a fine show on's I can tell
you, where we Citizens will laugh, and lie down ge^ all our wives with child
against a bank and get up again, ^stay, ha ^ast thou that wit in faith it will* be
admirable, to see how the very thought of green fields puts a man into sweet
inuenttions. I will presently possess Sim Quomodo of all the land, I have a
toy and i will do it: and because I see before mine eyes that most of our heirs
prove notorious Rioters after our deaths, and that cousonage in the father
wheels about to folly in the son, our posterity commonly foylde at the
same weapon, at which we plaide rarely. And being the world^ beaten word,
what is got over the Devils back, (that is by knauerie) must be spent under his
belly, (that is by lechery) being awake in these knowings, why should not I
oppose 'em now, and break destiny of her custom, preventing that by
policy, which without it must needs be Destiny? and I have took the
course, I will forthwith sicken, call for my keys, make my Will, and dispose
of all, give my son this blessing, that he trust no man, keep his hand from
a queen, and a Scriuener, live in his fathers faith, and do good to no body:
then will I begin to rave like a fellow of a wide conscience, and for all the
world counterfeit to the life, that which I know I shall do when I die, take
on for my gold, my lands, and my wrytings, grow worse and worse, call upon
the Devil, and so make an end* by this time I have indented with a couple of
searchers, who to uphold my device shall fray them out a'th Chamber with report
of sickness, and so la, I start up, and recover again: for in this business I
will trust, no not my spirits Falslight and shortyard, but in disguise note the
condition of al, how pitiful my wife takes my death, which will appear by
November in her eye, and the fall of the leaf inher body, but especially by
the cost she bestows upon my funeral, there shall I try her love and regard,
my daughters marrying to my will and lyking, and my sons affection after my
disposing: for to conclude* I am as jealous of this land as of my wife, to know
what would become of it after my decease


Tho I be poor, it is my glory to live honest.


I prithee do not leave me.


To be bawd.
Hell has not such an office,
I thought at first your mind had been preserved,
In virtue and in modesty of blood,
that such a face had not been made to please the unsettled Appetites of
several men
Those eyes turned up through prayer, not through lust,
But you are wicked, and my thoughts unjust.

Why thou art an unreasonable fellow in faith, do not al Trades live by their
ware, and yet called honest Livers? do they not thrive best, when they utter
most, and make it away by the great? is not hole-sale the chiefest
merchandise? do you think some Merchants could keep their wives so brave but
for their hole-sale? you are fowly deceived and you think so


You are so glewde to punishent and shame, Your words even deserve whipping --
to bear the habit of a Gentlewoman, and be in mind so distant


Why you fool you, are not Gentlewomen Sinners? and there is no coragious
Sinner amongst us, but was a Gentlewoman by the Mothers side I warrant you:
besides, we are not always bound to think those our fathers that marry our
Mothers, but those that lie with our Mothers, and they may be Gentlemen borne
and born again for ought we know, you know


True: corruption may well be Generatious first, Wee're bad by nature, but by
custom worst


Oh my Husband.


My Father, O my Father.


My sweet Master, dead!


Run boy, bid 'em ring out, he is dead, he is g^ne.


Then is as arrant a knave gone, as ere was called upon.


The happyest good that ever Shortyard felt,
I want to be expressed, my mirth is such,
To be struck now eene when his joys were hye,
Men only kiss their knaueries, and so dye,
Iu'e often marked it.
He was a famous Coozner while he lived,
And now his Son shall reap it, i will ha the lands,
Let him Study law after, it is no labor
to undo him for ever: but for Easy,
Only good confidence did make him foolish,
And not the lack of Sense, that was not it,
It Is worldly craft beats down a Scholars wit,
For this our Son and heir now, he
From his conception was entayl'd an Ass,
And he has kept it well, twenty five years now,
Then the sleightest art will do it, the lands lie fair,
No Sin to beggar a deceivers heir.

Here Wenefride, here, here, here, I have always found thee secret.


You shall always find me so Mistress.


Take this letter and this Ring.


Yes forsooth.


Oh how all the parts about me shake, -- enquire for one Master Easy at his
old lodging 'ith the Blackfryers


I will indeed forsooth.


Tell him the party that sent him a hundred pound the other day to comfort his
heart, has likewise sent him this Letter and this Ring, which has that virtue
to recover him again for ever say -- name no body Winifride


Not so much as you forsooth.


Good Girl, thou shall have a mourning Gown at the buryall of mine honesty.


And i will effect your will a my Fedelitie.


I do account my self the happyest Widdowe that ever counterfetted weeping,
in that I have the leisure now, both to do that Gentleman good, and do my
self a pleasure, but I must seem like a hanging Moonea little waterish a
while


I entertain both thee and thy Device,
Twill put them both to shame.

That is my hope sir,
Especially that strumpet.

Save you sweet widdowe,
I suffer for your heaviness.

O Master Rerage, I have lost the dearest husband that ever woman did enjoy.


You must have patience yet.


Oh talk not to me of patience and you love me, good Master Rerage.


Yet if all tongues go right, he did not use you so well as a man might.


Nay, that is true indeed Master Rerage, he nere vsd me so well as a woman
might have been used, that is certain in troth ta's been our greatest falling
out sir, and though it be the part of a widdowe, to show her self a woman for
her Husbands death, yet when I remember al his unkindness, I cannot weep a
stroke in faith Master Rerage, and therefore wisely did a great widow in this
land, comfort up another, go too Lady (quoth she) leave blubbering, thou
think upon thy husbands good parts when thou sheddest tears, do but
remember how often he has lain from thee, and how many naughty slipperie
turns he has done thee, and thou will nere weep for him I warrant thee -- you
would not think how that counsel has wrought with me Master Rerage, I could
not dispend another tear now, and you would give me nere so much


Why I count you the wiser Widdowe, it shows you have wisdom, when you can
check your passion, for mine own part, I have no sense to sorrow for his
death, whose life was the only Rub to my affection


Troth and so it was to mine, but take courage now, your'e a Landed Gentleman,
and my Daughter is seven hundred pound strong to join with you


But Lethe lyes'ith way.


Let him lie still, You shall tread ore him or i will fail in will.


Sweet widdowe.


What a beloude man did I live? my Servants gall their fingers with ringing, my
wives cheeks smart with weeping, stand in every corner, you may take water in
my house -- but am not I a wise fool now? what if my wife should take my death
so to heart, that she should sicken vppon't, nay swone, nay dye? when did I
hear of a woman do so, let me see, -- Now I remember me, I think it was
before my Time; yes, I have heard of those wives that have wept, and s^bd, and
swound -- marry I never heard but they recovered again, that is a comfort la,
that is a comfort, and I hope so will mine -- peace, it is nere upon the time, I
see, here comes the worshipful liuerie, I have the Hospital Boys, I perceive
little Tomazin will bestow cost of me, -- I Will listen to the common censure now,
how the world tongues me when my ^are lies low


Who Quomodo? merely enricht by shifts, And cousnages, believe it.


I see the world is very loath to praise me,
It Is Rawlye friends with me, I cannot blame it,
For what I have done, has been to vex and shame it.
Here comes my Son, the hope, the landed heir,
Ont whose rare thrift, will say men's tongues you lie,
I Will keep by law what was got craftily.
Me thinks I hear him say so:
He does salute the liuerie with good grace,
And solemn Gesture --

oh my young Worshipful M. you have parted from a dear Father, a wise and
proui-dent father


Art thou grown an Ass now?


Such an honest Father --


Prithee Beadle leave thy lying, I am scarce able to endure thee in faith, what
honesty did thou ere know by my Father speak, rule your tongue Beadle least
I make you prove it, and then I know what will become of you, it is the scuruy
est thing in the earth to belie the dead so, and he is a beastly Son and heir
that will stand by, and hear his father belyed to his face, he will nere
prosper I warrant him, Troth if I be not ashamed to go to Church with him, I
would I might be hanged, I fear such filthye Tales go on him, oh if I had
known he had been such a lewd fellow in his life he should nere have kept
me company


Oh -- o -- o!


But I am glad he is gone, tho twere long first, Shortyard and I will revel it
in faith, I have made him my Rentgatherer already


He shall be speedilye disinherited, he gettes not a foot, not the Crown
of a Molehill, i will sooner make a courtyer my heir for teaching my wife
tricks then thee, my most neglectfull Son? Oh now the coarse, I shall
observe yet farther


O my most modest, virtuous and remembering wife, she shall have all when I
dye, she shall have all


Master Easy? it is, oh what shift shall I make now? oh --


Sweet wife she sownes, i will let her alone, i will have no mercy at this time,
i will not see her, i will follow the coarse


The Devil grind thy Bones, thou co^sning Rascal.


Give her a little more air, tilt up her head, comfort thy self good widdowe,
do not fall like a Beast for a husband, there is more then we can well tell
where to put them, good soul


Oh, I shall be well anon.


Fie, you have no patience in faith, I have buried four Husbands, and never
offered them such abuse


Cousen, how do you?


Sorry to see you ill Couze.


The worst is past I hope.


I hope so to.


Lend me your hand sweet Couze I have troubled you


No trouble indeed forsooth -- Good Cousen have a care of her, comfort her up
as much as you can, and all little enough I warrant ye


My most sweet love.


My life is not so dear.


I have always pittyed you.


You Have shown it here. And given the desperate hope?


Delay not now, you have understood my love, I have a priest ready, this is the
fittest season, no eye offends us, Let this kiss Restore thee to more wealth,
me to more bliss


The Angels have provided for me.


I have not Scope enough within my breast,
To keep my joys containde: I Am Quomodoes
heir: the Lands assurances, and all are mine
(I have tript his Sons heels up) above the ground,
His father left him: had I not encouragement?
Do not I know what proves the Fathers pray?
The Son nere looks on it, but it melts away.
Do not I know the wealth that is got by fraud?
Slaue's share it like the riches of a Bawd.
Why it is a curse unquenchable, nere cooles.
Knaves still commit their consciences to fools:
And they betray who o'wde em, heeres all the bonds,
All Easies writings, let me see:

Now my desires wear crowns.


My joys exceed, Man is near healthful, till his follyes bleed.


Oh, behold the Villain, who in all those shapes Confounded your estate.


That slave, that villain.


So many Acres of good meadowe --


Rascal.


I hear you sir.


Rogue, Shortyard, Blastfield, Sergeant, Deputy, cousner


Hold, hold.


I thirst the execution of his ears.


Hate you that office,


I Will strip him bare for punishment and shame.


Why do but hear me sir, you will not think what I have done for you.


Given his Son my Lands.


Why look you, it is not so, your not told true,
I have Coosned him again merely for you,
Merely for you sir, it was my meaning then
That you should wed her, and have all again.
A my troth 'its true sir: look you then here sir, you shall not miss a
little scrowle sir, pray sir, let not the City know me for a knave, there be
ritcher men would envy my preferment if I should be known before them


Villain, my hate to more revenge is drawn,
When slaves are found, it is their base Art to fawn,
Within there --.

How now? fresh warders.


This is the other, bind him fast, have I found you Master Blastfield.


This is the fruit of Craft,
Like him that shootes up hye, looks for the shaft
And finds it in his forehead, so does hit
The Arrowe of our fate, wit destroys wit:
The head the bodies bane, and his own bears,
You hae Corn enough, you need not reap mine ears,
Sweet Master Blastfield.

I loath his voice, away.


What happiness was here, but are you sure you have all?


I hope so my sweet wife.


What difference there is in Husbands, not only in one thing, but in all.


Heeres good deeds and bad deeds, the writings that keep my lands to me, and
the bonds that gave it away from me

These my good deeds shall to more safety turn,
And these my bad have their deserts and burn.
I Will see thee again presently, read there.

Did he want all, who would not love his care?


What a wife have thou Ephestian -- Quomodo, so loving so mindful of her
duetye not only seen to weep but known to swone, I knew a Widow about Saint
Antlings so forgetful of her first Husband, that she married again within the
tweluemonth, nay some berladye within the month: there were sights to be seen,
had they my wives true sorrows seven nor seven years would draw them to the
stake, I would most tradesmen had such a wife as I, they hope they have, we
must all hope the best: thus in her honor


A modest wife is such a Jewel,
Every Goldsmiths cannot show it:
He that is honest, and not cruel,
Is the likelyest man to owe it.
And that is I, I made it by my self, and coming to her as a Beadle for my
reward this morning, i will see how she takes my death next her heart

Now Beadle.


Bless your mistrisships eyes from too many tears, Although you have lost a
wise and worshipful Gentleman


You come for your due Beadle, here 'ith house.


Most certain, the Hospital money and mine own poor forty pence.


I must crave a discharge from you Beadle.


Call your man, i will heartilye see my hand to a Memorandum.


You deal the truel yer.


Good wench still.


George, here is the Beadle come for his money, draw a Memorandum that he has
received all his due he can claim here ith house after this funeral


What politic directions she gives him, all to secure her self, it is time
in faith now to pity her, i will discover my self to her ere I go, but came it
off with some lively jest now, that were admyrable: I have it? after the
memorandum is written and all, i will set my own name to it Ephestian Quomodo,
she will start, she will wonder how Ephest* Quomodo came the there that was buried
yesterday: you are beset little Quomodo


Ninteene, twenty five pound, 1, 2, 3, and 4. d.


So, we shall have good sport, when it is read:


How now Lady, paying away money so fast?


The Beadles due here sir


Whose? it is Easy, what makes Easy in my house, He is not my wives over seer
I hope


What Is here?


He makes me sweat.


Memorandum that I have received of Richard Easy, all my due I can claim here
in the house* or any hereafter for me: In witness whereof, I have set to mine
own hand, Ephestian Qommodo


What have I done? was I mad?


Ephestian Quomodo.


I, well, what then sir? get you out of my house, First you master Prodigal
had land, away


What is the Beadle drunk or mad? Where are my men to thrust him out a doors.


Not so good Tomazin not so.


This fellow must be whipped.


Thank you good wife.


I can no longer bear him.


Nay sweet husband.


Husband I me undone, beggard, couzend, confounded for ever: married already?
will it please you know me now mistress Harlot, and master Horner, who am I
now


Oh, he is as like my the other husband as can be.


I Will have judgment, i will bring you before a Judge, you shall feel wife whether
my flesh be dead or no, i will tickle you in faith, in faith


The Judge that heel solicit knows me well.


Lets on then, and our greeuances first tell.


Here they come.


O where.


Heart of shame, upon my wedding morning so disgracd*
Have you so little conscience Officers,
You will not take a bribe?

Master Lethe we may lie together lawfully hereafter, for we are coupled
together before people ynow in faith


There goes the strumpet.


Pardon my wilful blindness and enjoy me.
For now the difference appears too plain,
Betwixt a base slave and a true Gentleman.

I do embrace thee in the best of love,
How soon affections fail, how soon they prove.

His cousnages are odious, he the plaintiff,
Not only framde deceitful in his life,
But so to mock his funeral.

Most just.
The Liuerie all assembled, mourning weeds,
Throughout his house even down to his last servant
The Herald richly hirde to lend him Arms,
Faind from his Ancestors, which I dare swear knew no
other Arms but those they labored with,
All preparations furnished, nothing wanted
Save that which was the cause of all, his death,
If he be living.

It Was an impious part.


We are not certain yet it is himself,
But some false spirit that assumes his shape,
And seeks still to deceive me.

Oh are you come? my Lord? their here, good morrow Tomazin.


Now what are you?


I am Quomodo my Lord, and this my wife,
Those my two men, that are bound wrongfully.

How are we sure you are he?


Oh you cannot miss my Lord.


I Will try you. Are you the man that lived the famous cousner?


O no my Lord.


Did you deceive this Gentleman of his right,
And laid Nets ore his land?

Not I my Lord.


Then you are not Quomodo but a counterfeit,
Lay hands on him, and bear him to the whip.

Stay, stay a little I pray, now I remember me my Lord, I cousned him indeed,
it is wondrous true


Then I dare swear this is no counterfeit.
Let all doubts cease this man is Quomodo.

Why la you now, you would not believe this, I am found what I am.


But setting these thy odious shifts apart,
Why did that thought profane, enter thy breast,
To mock the world with thy supposed death?

Conceive you not that my Lord? a policy.


So.


For having gotten the lands I thirsted still,
To know what fate would follow 'em.

Being ill got.


Your Lorpship apprehends me.


I think I shall anon.


And thereupon,
I out of policy possessed my son,
Which since I have found lewd, and now intend
To disinherit him for ever,
Not only this was in my death set down,
But thereby a firm trial of my wife,
Her constant sorrows, her remembering virtues,
All which are Dewes, the shine of a next morning 'dries 'em up all I see it.

Did you profess wise cousenage, and would dare
To put a woman to her two days choice,
When of a minute does it?

Less, a moment
The twinkling of an eye, a glimpse, scarce something does it,
Your Lordship yet will grant she is my wife.

O heaven!


After some penance, and the Deues of law
I must acknowledge that.

I scarce like
Those Deues of law.

My Lord, although the law too gently lot his wife,
The wealth he left behind he cannot challenge.

How?


Behold his hand against it.


He does deuize all means to make me mad, that I may no more lie with my wife
in perfect memory, I know it b^t^et the lands will maintain me in my wits:
the land will do so much for me


In witness whereof I have set to mine own hand,
Eph^stian Quomodo.
It Is firm enough your own sir.

A jest my Lord, I did I knew not what.


It should seem so, deceit is her own foe
Craftily gets, and childishly lets go.
But yet the lands are his.

I, warrant ye.


No my good Lord, the lands know the right heir, I am their master once more.


Have you the lands?


Yes truly I praise heaven.


Is this good dealing? are there such consciences abroad, how? which way could
he come by 'em


My Lord i will quickly resolve you that it comes to me
This cousner whom too long I called my patron,
To my thought dying, and the fool his son
Possessed of all, which my brain partly sweat for,
I held it my best virtue, by a plot
To get from him what for him was ill got.

O beastly Shortyard!


When no sooner mine,
But I was glad more quickly to resign.

Craft once discovered shows her abject line.


He hits me every where, for craft once known,
Does teach fools wit, leaves the deceiuer none.
My deeds have cleft me, cleft me.

Room there.


A little yet to raise my spirit.
Here master Lethe comes to wed my Daughter.
That Is all the joy is left me: ha? who is this?

What crimes have those brought forth?


The shame of lust,
Most viciously on this his wedding morning,
This man was ceazde in shame with that bold Strumpet.

Why, it is she he means to matrye.


No in truth.


In truth you do.
Who for his wife his Harlot does prefer,
Good reason it is, that he should martie her.

I crave it on my knees, such was his vow at first,


I Will say so too
And work out mine own safety,
Such was his vow at first, indeed my Lord,
How ere his mood has changed him?

O vilde slave!


He says it true my Lord,


Rest content,
He shall both marry and taste punishment.

Oh intolerable! I beseech your good Lordship if I must have an outward
punishment, let me not marry an inward, whose lastes will nere out, but grow
worse and worse: I have a wife stays for me this morning with seven hundred
pound in her pursse, let me be speedily whipped and be gone, I beseech your
Lordship


He speaks no truth my Lord, behold the Virgin,
Wife to a well esteemed Gentleman,
Loathing the Sin he follows.

I was betrayed, yes faith.


His own Mother my Lord,
Which he confessed through ignorance, and disdain,
His name so changed to abuse the world and her.

Marry a Hailot, why not? it is an honest man's fortune, I pray did not one of my
Cou^triemen marrye my Sister? why well then, if none should be married but
those that are honest where should a man seek a wife after Christmas? I pity
that Gentleman, that has nine Daughters to bestow, and seven of them Seeded
already, they will be good stuff by that time, I do beseech your Lordship to
remove the punishment, I am content to marry her


There Is no removing of your punishment.


O good my Lord.


Unless one here assembled
Whom you have most unnaturally a busde, beget your pardon.

Who should that be?
Or who would doote, that has been so abusde?
A troublesome penance -- sir.

Knave in your face, leave your mocking, Andrew, marry your Qeane and be quiet.


Master Easy.


I Am sorry you take such a bad course sir.


Master Quomodo.


Enquire my right name again next time, now go your ways like an Ass as you
came


Mass I forget my mother all this while, I Will make her do it at first, pray
mother your blessing for once


Calst me Mother? out, I defy thee slave.


Call me slave as much as you will, but do not shame me now, let the world
know you are my Mother


Let me not have this Villain put upon me I beseech your Lordship.


He Is justly cursed, she loathes to know him now,
Whom he before did as much loath to know,
Will thou believe me woman?

That Is soon done.


Then know him for a Villain, it is thy Son,


Art thou Andrew my wicked Son Andrew?


You would not believe me Mother.


How art thou changed? Is this suit fit for thee? a Tooth-drawers Son, this
country has ee'ne spoilde thee since thou camst heather, thy manners better
then thy clothes, but now whole clothes and ragged manners, it may well be
said that truth goes naked, for when thou had scarce a shirt thou had more
truth about thee


Thou art thine own affliction Quomodo:
Shortyard we banish, it is our pleasure.

Hence forth no woman shall complain for measure.


And that all Error from our works may stand,
We bannish Falslight evermore the land.
