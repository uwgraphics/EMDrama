Gentlemen, and Ladies! IF your serious occasions will permit me so much
honor, that this slight Book may be accepted and perused, I shall justly
acknowledge the favor to be far above either my hopes or merit. And if you
ever vouchsafed your Presence when it was presented on the Stage, I am
confident, your (no-way erring-) Judgments will now allow it, as it then was
intended, which was, rather to provoke a laughter, then occasion a
contemplation. It will likewise engage my grateful service, if I be not (in
your worthy opinions) taxt of Arrogance, to present my unpolished lines, when
daily those of excellence are offered to your Eyes and Ears: But in the
confidence of your clemency, I submit to the verdict of my grand Jury. And how
soever you are pleased to censure, will remain (as I ought) the humblest of
your servants

ROBERT COX.
IF ever Dog was weary of a day, then have I cause to be weary of my life; I
am a Blacksmith by my Trade, and (though I say it) I have bin accounted a good
Workman, but I could never yet forge, or hammer out means enough to satisfy
the insatiate gut of my son Simpleton. He will not work, and yet no sooner is
his nose out of the Alehouse, but his head is in the Cupboard: His insatiate
stomach may well defy a Giant, or the great Eater of Kent; but I have thought
upon a way which he shall either take in hand, or graze with Hobb my horse;
Sirrah Simpleton, where are you


Within. Here, here, Father.


Where, where, Sirrah?


At the Cupboard Father, at the Cupboard.


I thought as much; but come you hither sirrah, or I shall make your ears sing
prick song for you


It Is a miserable condition that a man cannot eat a little bit for his
afternoons Lunchins, but he must be disturbed in the best of his stomach


A bit do thou call it, O my conscience this devouring rascal, old as I am,
would eat me if he found me in the Cupboard


I do not think there is such a genteel Smith in the town, that has such an old
niggardly Coxcombe to his father as I, he knows I have no better a stomach then
a young green-sicknesse girl, and yet he grutches me every bit I eat


Leave off your muttering, and lend me an ear a while.


Truly I cannot spare one father; yet now I think on it, you have great occasion
for one ever since the last pillory day, but since you are my father, I will
vouchsafe to listen a while


You know that I am old.


The More's the pity, that you were not hanged while you were young.


Thou have drunk most of my means away.


I Will eat out the rest.


Leave your ill breeding, and give me sensibly a reason why you will not work?


Because I am lazy father.


Nay that is true.


True; why do you think I would be so unmannerly, to tell you a lie father.


How I shall maintein that coming stomach of yours, unless your self endeavor
for it: I know not, but if thou will be ruled, I Will make thee a man


A man! why what am I now, a mouse what would you make of me?


An Ass, an Ass, a gross Ass.


You may well make me a gross Ass, you have so good a pattern.


Listen to me; you know the widows daughter at the corner, sweet Mistress
Dorothy, she is both young and handsome, and has money too


I, and that will help to buy victuals.


Go and woo her, and I dare lay my life thou carriest her.


I carry her, father; alas, I have but a weak back, and besides I am somewhat
lazily given, as you say, it were a great deal better that she would carry me


Thou have no more wit then my hammer head has, and no more brains then an
Anvil, which every one may strike on, but never move it; go take your Fidle, at
that they say you are excellent, and when she thanks thee from her Chamber
window, say thou art my son, and that I sent thee about the thing she wotes of


O must I bumfiddle her under her Chamber window; well, I will go wash my
hands, and starch my face, because I may be sure to go cleanly about my
business


A pox of fortune, she was never my friend yet; the money that I got with so
much trouble, I lost with one unlucky chance at dice. I have no means nor
hopes left to supply me, but what my sweetheart Dorothy affords me, she has
and must again take pity of me, this is her window, I hope her mother will not
hear


Who Is that calls so boldly; speak, what are you?


Oh Doll thou know my fortunes, and my love last night has broke me, and by
thee my fortunes must be splintered; one half piece does the business


How often have I peec'd you, and still you break; and I shall do the same if
you continue thus; you know my mother keep's a look over my will, yet once
again I Will venture, come in the morning about five of the clock, and I Will be
ready for thee


Oh my sweet Doll, thou never did deceive me.


Now must I go play an Alampadoe. under Mistress Dorothy's Chamber window, and
all that time perhaps she is a snorting, for to say the truth my music will
hardly have the virtue to waken her, and if she should wake, I could not tell
what to say to her unless it were to desire her to go to bed again. And because
I will be sure to be acceptable to her, I will join my nightingale voice
thereunto


What slave is this presumes to court my Mistress, could I but see him, I would
satisfy my anger with the ruin of his limbs, but he is gone, and I loose time
in seeking Exit


That was a roaring Rogue, he has made my heart jumpe upright into my mouth,
and if I had not held it fast with my teeth, without doubt it had forsaken my
body; but he is gone, and now I will venture forward


I heard some music at my sweet-hearts window, could I but find him, I would
cut him, and flash him til his whole body were anoatmized; but he is gone, and
it was his wisest course


That Roaring Rouge was far worse then the the other, he has almost frighted my
song out of my head. Oh! we true and faithful lovers, what perils and dangers
must we undergo, to gain the wills and affections of our dearest deares; but
now to my music, and because she shall take a great pleasure to think on it, I
will sing a song of a young wench that had a great mind to be married before
her time

Oh! mother let me have a husband kind,
with toitre loytre loitre.
That day and night I may comfort find
of a toitre, etc.
I care not whether honest man or knave,
so that he keep me sine and brave,
And that none else but I may have
his toitre etc.
Oh daughter you are not old enough
for a toitre etc.
And husbands often prove rough
with a toitre etc.
Your tender heart no grief can carry
as they must do sometimes that marry
You yet may well a twelvemonth tarry
for a toitre etc.
Oh! mother I am in my teens
for a toytre etc.
And younger wifes are often seen
with a toitre etc.
I pray let not me so Idle stand,
for I can do as well as any can.
I have had a proof with John our man
of his toitre etc.
Well if she does not run mad for me now, it is pity she should have music
under her window, as long as she lives again


What owl is that shreikes so at my window, if he meant music sure he was
mistaken, I was about to have eaten my breake-fast, but this fool has turned my
stomach. What art thou that art so troublesome


Good Mistress Dorothy, it is I, your none sweet-swotterkin, and if you please
to throw your eyes out of the window upon me, you shall behold one of the
faithfullest lovers that ever took hammer in hand. I love you better and dear,
then a Bear does honey, and I hope you will affect me as much as a Sow does a
bunch of Carrots


Oh is it you? I thought none but a puppy like your self, would have disturbed
the neighbors with your gridiron-musick, a Saw were far mor pleasing


Forsooth I am very sorry that you have no better skill in music, in my
opinion I sung most melodiously, but if you will be pleased to look with eyes
of judgment upon me, you will express your love in a better manner to me


I shall express my love if you continue here, in a far Worser manner then you
think for; do you see this chamber-pott, it longs to be acquainted with that
trainless head of yours; therefore be gone, and save your self a washing


If you should wash me, I think it would be but labor in vain; yet if you
please to distill any of your sweet water upon me, I shall desire to be smelt
out by you


You ass, you puppy; must you needs force a drowning.


Is this the beginning of love? it is almost as bad as the proverb to me: stay,
it may be it is rosewater. Voh, it is as rank urine as ever any Doctor cast.
I Will call this same old Simpleton my father, that set me about this business.
Oh! Father Simpleton, where are you


Oh mine Son, how have thou sped boy?


O! I have sped most abominably, father,
I got a great deal more then I expected.

Oh my own natural boy!


I natural, to be sure; I had nere come here else.


But how did she relish thee.


Why she relished me with a whole chamber pot full of water.


Why thou ass, thou puppy, thou fool, thou coxcombe.


Why? how can I help it* why you (...) me so like a fool*


Come show me to her, and you shall see how I will handle her.


Nay father, I should be loath to marry her, after you have had the handling of
her


This is her Chamber, is it not?


Yes* I know it by a good token, for here she opened the sluice, and let the
floodgates out upon me


Mistress Dorothy, Mistress Dorothy, pray come to the window.


Sirrah, hold your tongue.


What again? sure this whole morning is nothing but my trouble* what wise-aker^
is that now


She calls you wise-aker^* speak now.


I am your neighbor, Old Simpleton the Smith.


And I young Simpleton the Smith.


Oh neighbor is it you* here was your son but now, and he kept a worse noise
then a Bearbaiting* but you are civil, I will come down to you


Look you there sirrah, she will come down tome, she says.


I by that time I have been a courtier as long as you have been, one woman or
other may come down to me too


Good morrow nieghbour, what is your business pray.


Why it is this: this is my son. Nay it is my son, I Will assure you.


Yes forsooth, he is sure I am his son; my mother told him so.


Now I look better on him, he seems to me more handsome then before* your
company seasons him with discretion* but what is your business pray Sir


Why, if you please forsooth, I would fain Join you two together in the way of
Matrimony


Yes forsooth, to mock a marriage*


But hold Sir, two words to a bargain* what profession is your son of.


Forsooth I am a Blacksmith, and though I say it, I have as good working gear
as any smith in the parish* all my neighbors wives shall be my witness


Sirrah, hold your tongue.


Why, shall I come a wooing, and say nothing for my self*


But what estate I pray has your son in posse^


Father, what estate have I in a posset.


Forsooth, two Cowes you shall have with him.


With a calfe to my knowledge.


Four ewes and lambs, and a horse to ride to market on.


Yes, and a ^ no, now I think on it, you may keep your ass your self.


Four mark in money.


Do you mark that.


With a bed and blankets.


And then we may dance the shaking of the sheets when we can.


These promises are fair, and if performed, I hope I shall not need repent my
bargain


Nor I neither, come let us to bed presently, and afterward we will talk on it.


No, no, first to Church, and then to bed.


Oh then you will not follow the fashion of our country, we commonly go to bed
first, and to Church when we can, but come I am contented


How now friend, what make you hereabouts?


My business is the same, I think, with yours; is it not for Dorothy?


I do confess it, and have known what love you long have born her; let us go
together


Stand close, what means this?
Here comes the bride and bridegroom on so stately,
That were but maid and batchelour so lately.
And now let all the Blacksmithes be invited,
Cause Vulcan and his Venus are united.

What should this mean, Doll has a hat on?
She did not use to wear one.

Oh gentlemen! though I desire your company, yet now I heartily could wish your
absence


Why, what is the matter Doll?


I am married.


To whom?


Do you not know him? Young Simpleton the Smith.


That fool, that Coxcombe; I Will break his hammer with his own jolt-head.


Stand close, I hear him coming.


Sweetheart now we are married, things ought to be well carried.

And the first thing we should take care for, is how to get victuals, what is
that


Nothing but the Rats and Mice.


As sure as I live, I Will lay a trap for those Rats. But what is the matter now?


Nothing but the Neighbors Dogs.


It Is a thousand pities but such Currs were hanged up presently.


Oh Gentlemen! I would you were out of the house, for I am afraid he will
return again ere I can handsomely shut the door


Why Doll, Doll.


Come ye behind me presently, I pray dispatch.


Doll: I have considered, that to set up my trade is the way to get victuals,
and I wont nothing of my tools but only a pair of Bellows


Fear not husband, I have a little money that you know not of, and if I can but
hear of a good bargain, I will not fail to buy a pair of Bellows


Oh thou pretty loving kind pigsnie, but what makes thee wear thy coats of


Do not you know husband, it is the fashion for new-married wives.


Is it so? it is an excellent fashion in the Summer time; but I Will go out and
return presently


What will you do? it is ten to one he spies you, and then my reputation runs a
hazard


Appoint what way you will, we are contented.


I see him coming back; and truth to say, the course I shall advise will seem a
strange one, yet it must be: you know he did appoint that I should buie for him
a pair of Bellows; now if you two can bear it lustily, and blow it strongly,
this visit may be kept off from his knowledge


Nay any thing good Doll, we cannot now be choosers.


So, lie down: I Will fetch a Chafingdish of Charcoal hither, and practice you a
while before he come


I have played many a mad prank in my life, yet never till now acted a pair of
Bellows


So, so, blow lustily and fear not.


Wife: I have considered with my self, that if we lay out all the money in a
pair of Bellows, we should have little or nothing left to buy victuals


Oh husband! you are deceived; for I have bought you a pair of Bellows, the
whole town shows not a neater


Is this a pair of Bellows, let me see? this is an alamoda pair of Bellows, but
look you Doll; when the Bellows-mender comes by, let him stop this hole here,
for the wind comes out abominably. I Will call my Father Simpleton to see this
pair of Bellows. Father, father, come hither


Did you ever see such a pair of Bellows as my wife has bought.


A pair of Bellows, Son! me thinks this would serve better for an Anvill: Let Us
try how it will bear our strokes


Well, a match.
