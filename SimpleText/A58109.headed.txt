In The latter Age, ere Critics dared to Damn,
Or Censure rashly, what deserved a Name;
When Bully Ben lugg'd out in Cat'line's Cause,
And huff'd his duller Audience to Applause,
Then if the Poet swore 'twas good, each Guest
Believed the Author, and approved the Feast:
But now in humble Prologue, the poor Muse
Implores your favor, and for mercy sues.
To day the ty'rd Satyr takes his rest,
And has at last himself a Fool confessed:
In vain is all his Malice, or his Art,
He jerks, you grin, and damn him when you smart.
This Ag's Crimes are past good Satyrs Cure,
He scarce can lash you more than you will endure.
The busy Statesman, can in a well-writ Scene
See Treason punished, and yet Plots again:
Young Gaming Heirs, who see poor Cully trickt,
Laugh at the Jest, and the same Night are nickt.
The London Cuckold sees his Brother Horned,
Yet is not by the Stage-Example warned.
The high kept Miss can see poor Jiltals fate,
Yet Cuckolds her kind Keeper for a Treat:
Since Headlong Folly then uncheck'd will reign,
Successful Satyr but Rebels in vain*
Our harmless Author therefore bid me say,
That even Fopp'ry goes untouched to day;
There Is scarce a knotted Fringe in all his Play.
The stately Side-Box Beau may cock his Nose,
And Mob'd up Phillis take a Morning Dose
Of fifty Dishes at the Choc'late-House.
And when the Consort's done, the Ladies may
There entertain the Beaux till break of day,
And still pretend they for their Coaches stay.
Men of no business to the Court may come,
And Essenc'd Wigs Perfume the Drawing Room;
Where, on the Window, Fops, their Wit to prove,
Write Petty-Treason to the God of Love.
In short, whatever Crimes o'r run the Town,
Here Is none to day that are with Malice shown:
We Have Plot and Humor too, but as for Wit,
Let that be judged by the discerning Pit.

MR. Justice, this was kindly done of you, to come and meet us.


Since I knew of your coming into the Country, I could not do less than ride
out a Mile or two, and now, Mr. Alderman, you are welcome to Canterbury


Sir, I thank you.


What! are not your Daughter and Neice light out of the Coach yet?


I bid 'em stay till we had determined which Inn to lodge at, where is the best
entertainment


Let me see, there is the Three Kings, and there the Old Kings Head. I protest
this Riding out has got me a Stomach; I Will see which House has the best
provisions, and we'll take up there


Do so; in the mean time I Will step to the Coachman and pay him.


And order my Man to have my Horse home.


Speak in the Star there, Tapster.


Chamberlain, show up into the Rose, quickly.


Mr. Justice.


Mr. Greedy.


I see, Sir, you have a Coach full of Friends come to Town, please to let 'em
be my guests, they shall have civil entertainment


Sir, here they may have excellent accommodation.


Mr. Justice.


Sir.


Look you Neighbors, all favor and affection set aside, what have you to Eat
and Drink, what curiosity have you for Supper, there is the point


For Wine, Sir, I have such a Pipe of Canary pierced but this Morning --


Right Racy Canary.


Three Years old, as full of Nits as the Sun is of Motes, sparkling, as it were
the extract of Diamonds


Say thou.


'Twill make a Cat speak, a Judge deaf and dumb, an old Man get Children, or
bring a Dead Man to life again. It Is a ^lower Mr. Justice


I have such a Butt of Malago, Rich Old Malago.


Old Malago!


And such a Butt of Sherry!


Sherry too, and Old Malago! there is a double blessing; let me taste --


Then if you are for Claret, Sir --


Or for White -- Sir.


I have such --


Not the like in England.


Hold, hold Friends, all this is very well, what have you not that is Eatable.


You may have Mutton --


Or Lamb --


Or Rabbits --


Or Chickens --


Or Pigeons --


Some young Turkeys, Sir, some young Turkeys.


Or a Pig, a Pig, a delicate fat white Sow Pig.


Pig -- Pig -- delicious meat.


Sir, I have three brace of the plumpest young Patridge.


Young Patridge!


And I a brace of the rarest Pheasants.


Mr. Justice, I have such a rarity, such a morsel of Meat.


What Is that, what is that?


I had a whole live Calf sent me from Flanders, and within you may see such a
Chine of Gaunt Veal --


Gaunt Veal! O blessing sent from Heaven! let me go --


Mr. Justice.


Let me go, or I Will lay you by the Heels.


'Twere Treason to let you go, without acquainting your worship.


Bear witness, he assaults me in the Highway.


That I have half a dozen of the finest largest Bruges Capons, that were ever
sent a present into England


Bruges Capons!


They were fed with Marrow, Amber Greece, and blanched Almonds.


Let me down on my knees and give thanks, -- I am in the Land of Canaan. -- O
Bounty, -- bounty, -- bounty. --


Get up Sir.


Which way shall I turn me.


This way Sir.


Here Sir.


This way Sir.


Here Sir.


Here Is the Gaunt Veal.


Here the Bruges Capons.


Stand off, let me go, let me go, O Gaunt Veal, Bruges Capons, capon, capon,


What Is the matter, what is come to you?


They have undone me, -- I starve in the middle of plenty. I know not which to
choose; A pox on you, join both your Houses together, O Capon! O Veal! -- O
Veal! -- O Capon


Sir, I have this day come down by the London Coach, a basket of your little
round Marrow puddings


What, your white puddings, made of Marrow and Almonds?


They Will melt in your Mouth Sir --


London Marrow puddings, -- the scales are turned; and now Mr. Alderman, let us
in and feast like Epicures, Gaunt Veal -- and Marrow puddings


Come let us have Supper in good time.


You shall Sir.


A pox of those Marrow puddings, I have lost my Guests, but it pleases me to
think how the hungry Justice will scold when he finds none of those danties,
for we both lied abominably.


Sir, I suppose you may be Mr. Alderman Furr.


Furr is my name, your business friend.


My Master, Sir Barnaby Buffler greets you; he sent me before to wait your
coming, and to let you know, he will in few hours hence be in Town. -- the
farther particulars of his mind you will understand from this --


I am glad he will be here to night.


Sir, my Master's mightily pleased with the thoughts of Marrying your Daughter;
he talks of nothing but her all day; she will be very happy if she can but away
with some small faults


I have taught her Obedience, and she that is so to a Father, will be the same
to a Husband. -- He Is Rich


Right Sir, now I have delivered you your Letter, I Will observe my Orders, and
give this to your Daughter


I Will send her to you, whilst I read my Letter.


Strange humor in Parents, to enslave their Children for wealth. -- The estate
and not the Man is now regarded


Pray thee, cosen, leave me not in this extremity.


No, no, come, where is the Esquire to this Knight Errant.


By me, Sir Barnaby Buffler commends this to the fair hands of Madam Jacinta.


Are you his Servant.


I am faithful Servant to your humble Servant, and the Person designed for your
Husband, he desires all things may be in readiness to night, that the Marriage
may be solemnized to Morrow morning


His message seems to imply a command.


He Is a Person not to be thwarted nor instructed, for when he has once said the
word -- hum. --


This Buffler's but a foolish kind of a name, come friend, be frank with us,
and let us know a little more of his humor, -- but first what manner of person
is he


Auh, a Spark of the times; a brisk blade of a about Fifty five Years of Age,
who to cool the intemperance of his Youth, -- resolves forthwith to take the
Sovereign Remedy, a Wife


Make have and let us see the Letter, for if he be a lover of that Age, his
style must be very amourous and pleasant; for nothing's more ridiculous than an
old Bachelor in Love, or to set up for a Beau


You Will find it a very extraordinary Letter.


Did he read it to you.


With a very cheerful countenance.


Since he is his Confident, read it out.


MY Child, I have an Estate in two Counties, I am Lord of three Manners, I have
One Thousand Five Hundred Thirty Six Pounds Thirteen Shillings and Four pence
Half penny Rent, besides Pepper Corns; and Esquire Careless, my half and only
Brother, is my next Heir, if I Die without Issue. I am told that in Marrying
you, I may get as many Children as I think good; prepare therefore against to
morrow, in order to the first; as for the rest, we'll think of them at leisure.
Consider you lodge at an Inn, therefore be not seen but in a Masque, that it
may not be said you appeared in pub^ick places amongst strangers, for methinks
already I begin to be concerned for your Honor, and that you ought not to be
seen without my leave



This Knight must be some strange Monster.


This fellow's of a Complexion to tell all. Well friend, -- you say your Master
is elderly, but as to his Person


Why, pretty bulky -- but lusty and Heartwhole.


The caution in his Letter, shows him of a Jealous humor.


If he be jealous of his Wife, as he is of his Money, the Devil shall not get her
out of his clutches


And obstinate.


As a Bitch that has Puppies, When you bid her come off her litter, he will have
his humor, tho the Devil stood at the door


And how must a Wife deal with all these good qualities.


To tell you my mind, in short, I even pity you, that so handsome a young Lady
should be Married to a gruf Curmudgeonly old fellow, with whom you can never
enjoy a minutes happiness; in hopes to be left a rich Widow


You speak honestly.


How miserable shall I be made.


Well, have you done your Message according to order?


I have said my say, and now I Will go acquaint my Master.


The Bells ring to Prayers -- Put your selves in order, and go to the
Cathedral. By that time -- your intended Husband, Sir Barnaby, will be here, at
present he is busy with the


Sure, Sir, if you loved me, you would not be so hasty to part with me.


It Is the great care and love I have for you, makes me solicitous to see you
well disposed of: There ends a Father's care, for when he gives a Daughter in
marriage, it is supposed he gives her to more than a Father; for such is a
Husband. Husband and Wife are one


That Rule, Uncle, will not hold in Arithmetic, for according to the first
Principle, one and one, make two


Mad-Cap Niece, meddle with your own matters -- Let me see --


Nay, Uncle, never put on your Considering-Cap for an Answer; what I say is
true, and I Will give you a farther demonstration that Man and Wife are not one:
For in this Age they are seldom or never together, the Man's in one place and
the Wife in another; as far asunder as ever they can get: And you know it is
impossible for one and the same thing, to be at the same time in several places


She has a very unhappy Wit; I am glad, Daughter, that you are going from her,
for she is enough to spoil all the young Women she meets with* But I hope she will
have a Husband will meet with her


Never of your choosing, Uncle.


Likely so, for you're hair-brained enough to do things of your own head.


Do you think, Uncle, I have not as much Wit to choose a Husband as you?


Well, well, follow your own course; but I hope you will get a Husband one day
will Cudgel your bones for you


But, Uncle, it is not now as it was in your young days; Women, then, were poor
sneaking Sheepish Creatures, but in this Age we know our own strength, and have
Wit enough to make use of our Talents: If I meet with a Husband makes my Heart
ache, I Will make his Head ache


I am apt enough to believe, one House will be too hot to hold you long: I
doubt not but your Husband (whoever shall have the ill fortune to be so) will
in a short time be as weary of you as I am


Should he prove but half so ill natured as you are (which certainly no young
man can) I Would swear my self a Virgin, and consequently sue out a Divorce against
him for impotency


Come, Niece, leave your unluckiness, and now I have brought you down for
company, don't employ your Wit to teach my Daughter disobedience


These old Fornicators keep such ado with Obedience --


Go, get you gone to Church --


To Church, or any where, to be rid of an old man.


Go, go, I have other business than to mind your tittle tattle.


Farewell, Nuncle -- Teach my Grannam to -- Spin.


Thou art a mad Wench to talk so.


Pish -- I Would have Women say, and do what they list; Have not we rational Souls
as well as men? What made Women mopes in former Ages, but being ruled by a
company of old Men and Women? Dotage then was counted Wisdom, and Formality
called Gravity and good Behavior


What would you advise me to in this extremity? I shall never love this Knight.


Let him know your mind, and if he will not believe you he is an unmannerly Fool;
And there is an end. Come Wench --


O here is my Master: Sir, they are come, I have delivered the Letters.


My Sister and I then will give them a visit presently; whilst she holds the
Old man in discourse, I Will upbraid Jacinta


It Is sore against her will -- But you will have a better opportunity -- for in
my hearing the Alderman bid them go hear Prayers at the great Church, 'twill
not be long ere they come this way


Haste then to our Inn, acquaint my Sister they are come, and tell her the
occasion of my stay. --


Ha! Is not that my old Friend -- Franck Lovell?


Careless! -- who thought to have met you at Canterbury after eight years
absence. How fares my friend


Well in health and mind: In Purse too, I hope.


Where have you been all this while? What Country has held you?


All Countries, and sometimes no Country; for I have been most of the time at
Sea


At Sea!


I Will tell thee in short -- Coming, at the Death of my Father, to a Mortgaged
Estate, and I too extravagant to recover it, went a Voluntier to Sea, aboard
one of the King's Frigates; when our Fleet returned I went aboard the French,
then the Dutch, and so from one Fleet to another, till I touched upon most of
the known Coasts the Christian World Trafficks to. By this time I hope my
Estate is disincumber'd, and I am free in the World


Prudently done, and now you are grown a stanch sober man.


I have not parted with one grain of my old humor, I am as wild as ever, only
I have learned to Sin at cheaper Rates. But what is more material, let me know
what is become of thy elder Brother -- Is he Dead yet, and you in possession of
the whole Estate


No, he lives; and what is worse, now in his Old Age is going to marry.


Bring me to him, I Will Drink him Dead.


If the Drink were Poison, 'twou'd scarce have time to work. To morrow is the
prefixed day, unless prevented by Stratagem: My Sister and I, by his G^acious
Letters, are invited down to his Wedding


Lives the Lady here in Canterbury?


At London -- But he durst not venture thither for fear of Expenses -- and that
after Marriage -- his Wife should be buying fine Coaches, Beds, and Furniture


Prudently considered.


This therefore was the appointed place to meet at; her Father and he have
treated by Letters this Twelvemonth, but a Nights Courtship must serve the
Lady: He marries her in the morning, and the next day removes to his Country
House


Which must be her Monument -- for there she will be buried alive! -- Is she
likely to have Children


Young and handsome.


That Is bad --


But what is worse, she is the only Woman I ever did, or can love. But my
discourse is unseasonable -- Let me know your Inn, I Will visit you at Night, and
tell you all


Whither are you now going?


The party I have been speaking of, is going to Church, and I take this
opportunity to discourse her


It Is gone too far -- Let thy dull Elder Brother take her, you shall along with
me -- I Will show you a Companion worth forty Mistresses


What is he?


An honest Tarpaulin -- The Son of an English Renegade: He was born a
Shipboard, and never was ashore beyond a Sea Port Town -- except up in the
Countries amongst Indians and Spaniards, to Ravage, Burn, and Plunder, for he
has been a Buccanier from his Infancy


His Employment disgraces not his Parentage.


Stout he is and brave -- and that temper has inclined him to leave that
hellish Crew, and employ his Valor in the Service of his Father's Native
Country: He brings with him sixty thousand Crowns, and doubtless will have good
Employment -- for from Captains of Ships, and Governors of Plantations, the
King has heard much of his Valor -- Come, you shall drink a Bottle, or a Bowl
of Punch, with me and the Captain


Were I going to any one but a Mistress.


Pox o'thy Mistress; if thou were going to a Wench I might excuse you -- but I
should think my self cursed, should I consent thou should solicit any Woman
in the way of Matrimony


Will you never leave this lewd wild humor?


Not upon the score of Matrimony. Why, Franck, I Will tell thee, I am now like a
Calf in the Fens, that straggles every where, and feeds where I like best; but
should I marry, I should be tether'd to one spot of Ground; at best, be
confined to an Enclosure


The Horse that is loose often falls into a foul Ditch, or is put in the Pound
for straying in his Neighbors Ground: Marriage is honorable and safe


It would be so if all Wives were honest: I Will undertake a Mistress shall love
thee twice as long as any Wife thou can find. Nothing choaks Love like the
Surety of Possession: Love is an excellent Meat, but Marriage an ill Sauce.
Were I going to Tyburn, I would cry, drive on Carman, and choose to Sing a
Penitential Psalm at the Gallows, rather than return to say, For Better for
Worse


Atheists in Love, like Zealots in Religion, are not to be reclaimed by
Argument, yet now and then are converted by some lucky accident, you may one
day see a beauty, that like a burning glass shall draw all thy loose flames
within a narrow compass


Beauty is more brittle than the glass you talk of, and Man's estimation of it
less durable. I may perchance Love only one at once; but not that one always;
and whilst I am in my right wits, I will not leave delightful variety, for the
unsavory insipid bitts of Constancy


Well, Jacinta has a Kinswoman for her Companion, so beautiful, her Eyes would
fix your wandering thoughts, and make you abandon all Women for her sake


So thinks the devout young Novice, newly entered into his Cloisture; he has no
sooner forsaken the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, but imagines he is able to
make the greatest Debauchee, in Love with Mortification


My mind at present is not composed enough, to return an answer to every thing
you urge; but venture your self with me into her company, and if ever you return
the same Man --


I know my self so well grounded in Sin, and have tasted so much the sweets of
wickedness, that I dare venture my self into any temptation to the contrary; and
to see this miracle, will suffer my self to be seduced into civil company, and
if they do debauch me --


Come then.


Sir, Madam, Jacinta and her Cosen went out the back way, but I believe
Prayers were almost done, -- for they return already. -- See yonder, they come
with their Masks on. I know their Petticoats


Retire -- whilst I discourse one, do you detain the other, to give me
opportunity; these are they --


Accost thy own natural, and leave me to manage the other impertinent.


My Heart's my guide, -- stay Jacinta, take off your mask, and let me see if
your Face is as much altered as your Heart. Do you fly me, -- but I Will pursue
you, as


If you have lost your Tongue too, ye are a blessed pair, -- so were it not for
your Tongues, you Women would all be Angels


Da-da -- da --


Nay, nay, you are not to pass so, I am resolved both to hear and see you first.


Well, what would the Man be at?


The Man's at what he would be, he is at you.


What do you mean?


Faith I cannot resolve you till I see your Face; pull off your Mask, and then
I Will tell you what I mean


Suppose I will not.


Than I shall suppose you very ugly, -- for I never knew a Woman that had a
handsome Face, could endure to hide it


Yes, if she likes not her Company.


Yet she would have her company like her; I trust more to a Woman's pride, than her
Love or good Nature; for tho they are ugly, they think themselves handsome, and
would be thought so by others


Why then do they maintain the humor of Vizard Masks?


Because under them they Sin concealed. I Will avouch, Vizard Masks ruin more
Women's Virtues, than all the Bawds in the Nation


Your Reason for that, good Mr. Voucher.


Under the vizard, the Wife goes to the Play, Ball, or Masquerade, undiscovered
to her Husband; the Maid unknown to her Mistress; the Daughter or Neice,
unperceived by her Relations; the Mask draws the Gallants, and tho at first you
come but out of curiosity, to hear what Men will say, our quick Repartees, our
gentle Bawdry, and brisk raillery, tickles your Ears; your bodies are Buxome,
your Bloods grow wanton, your fancy strikes firmly on some Man or other, the
Gallant grows importunate, and you are Conquered


Do you find them so frail?


A Woman's Ear is the Outwork to her Chastity, lodge your self but there, and
the Fort is more than half taken; when once a Woman hearkens to what you say,
she will soon do what you would have her


Then you take a Parley for a Surrender.


No, but after a Parley they soon yield.


Now I have a mind to stay and talk with you, but must be forced to leave you,
to avoid your ill Opinion


Nay, if you have a mind to it, you will do it, let me think what I will; and if
you will not pull off your Mask, I Will even begone and leave you -- fare you well


And fare you well.


Nay, if you look over the Shoulder at me, I Will turn again, for you have no
mind I should begone, I Am sure


Why did you look back at me?


To see --


If I would look at you, and so we even caught one another; and what can you
say to me, that I cannot retort on you again


But I Will be judged by your self, if I have not more Reason to think you desire
my stay, than I yours; you have a full sight of me, see what I am, and know
whither you like me or not; you are all Vizard, Scarf, and Petticoat; for ought
I know, you may want a Nose, set of Teeth, be Squint-eyed, or blobber Lip'd


You Will make me as ugly as the Devil, am I not cloven footed, think you?


I Will tell you that presently.


Nay, --


A handsome Leg and Foot, I Will be sworn; and here is a well shaped Hand and Arm,
and what Breasts are here, how round and plump


Hands off, your enquiry begins to grow troublesome.


If you have a Face and Features, answerable to your Limbs, you are a prime piece
of Woman's flesh


Do you think I have?


Gad do I.


Than to keep your good Opinion, I Will be gone, and you shall not see it. Nay, nay,
no attempts -- hands off.


I have sworn to see it.


And I have sworn you shall, but stand at greater distance, farther, farther
yet, see --


Excellent Creature!


Fare you well.


Ha, are you so cunning; she is gone. by her wit I did not think she had had so
good a Face; for wit and beauty seldom go together, in a Woman, she has a large
stock of both, and I could wish my self in Bed with her; but the thoughts of
her are momentary


False, faithless Woman.


Prithee think no more of her, come now go with me and be merry, we'll have
Women in abundance


Hang 'em Jilts.


No, such Women as your Mistress is, are more like Jilts, those I mean are good
Conscionable Girls, that will not let you spend your Money for nothing, with
the others you wast your Gold and time, and at last like young Heifers, when
they come to be milk'd, spurn at you in defiance, and away they frisk


Ah Jacinta; can a Father's word outweigh a Lover's vows.


Damn this pining, whining, puling, peaking, sneaking, sniveling Love; I Will
carry you where you shall see, merry, gay, jocond, sprightly Love; thou shall
have it in Armfuls, and dilate thy self in pleasure


I shall be no company, my Soul is out of tune.


We'll have Music, Wine, and Women, to divert you: yet in spite of all the
Sex

I Will keep my Soul free, as the Bird that flies in the Air,
And never Love one, till I of all the rest despair.

IT IS a fine Evening, Cosen, and I love to look about me.


Ha! these are they.


Here comes Mr. Lovel's Friend.


We'll stand him bare faced.


Now, which is she that I am in Love with?


He Is at a stand.


He Would fain know me again; but prithee take up a brisk humor, and let us try to
puzle him


No, prithee let us go in.


What are you upon the Wing, or do you come out a grazing like Rabbits, just at
the Burrow's mouth; that as soon as any body comes, you may pop into your holes
again


We had need be watchful, when such pochers as you are abroad.


Your Watchfulness signifies little; I come now like a Ferret to creep into
your holes, and scare you out of your Burrows


But if instead of a Burrow, you should run into a Warrenner's trap.


And that you may easily do, for we are no out-lying Conies, we keep within
heart of the Warren


Ay, but I know your Musees, your inlets and outlets, and wherever the Rabbits
pass, the Ferret or Weesel may venture. You see I come just to the same place;
'twas here you popt in from me before; But now I am got between you and the
hedge


But how do you know, that we are the same pair?


And which of us is it, that was too nimble for you?


You had best have a care on which you venture, for in such cases, you ought not
to spoil your friend's game


It Is one of you.


I see you are no good hound; you cannot follow the scent well.


Many a good nosed Dog is at a loss, when the scent is crossed; but if I catch
one, and my friend the other; if we are mistaken, let him say which is his, and
we will make a change


But which of us two do you think would fall to your share?


Y'Gad I don't know.


Don't you know a Woman's Face, when you see it a second time?


She showed it with such a Legerde-main -- her Mask was no sooner of, then on
again, and she was gone


Observe us well.


Let me see -- Faith not I, -- if you had your Masks on, I should know her from
a Thousand, at the very sight of her Vizard, my Heart would go pit -- a -- pat


If you are so in Love with the complexion of Velvet, you should have a Negro
for your Mistress


There is beauty in black, why else do Ladies put on patches, and some love
black Hair better than light, and why not black Faces as well


But you would be for a white one at this time, if you knew which was under the
Vizard you like so well


I am glad he does not, for than he would pretend Love to one of us.


Gad but I would not to you, nor ever a Woman in the World.


I dare swear you would.


Perhaps I might make you believe I was in Love with you.


No, that you could never do.


Why, don't you think your selves handsome enough to be loved.


Yes; but we think you have more Wit.


What, than to Love one of you?


Yes, or any body else, that is never like to Love again.


Are you an Enemy to me, or to Love?


To Love; I think it a very foolish thing.


But it is Marriage makes it so, give me Love as nature made it, free and
unconfined -- observe but Mistress and Gallant, how brisk, how gay, how fierce
they are in their Amors! whilst Marriage-Love comes like a Slave, laden with
Fetters, dull and out of humor


For my part, I am rather for a Gallant, than a Husband.


So am I clearly --


It Is well dissembled on one side; one of you I am sure speaks against her
Conscience; but if you are as you say, you are Girls for me


What both --


Both, I gad both.


Hold, one's enough, and if you will be a Gallant to one of us, we expect you
should be constant


That circumstance makes it too like Marriage.


The constancy is while you pretend; not but that either Mistresses or Gallant
may choose elsewhere, but they must love but one at onc


But which of us will you choose?


Faith I Will be for her I talked to in the Mask.


Well Sir, when you find which of us two is she; claim her for your Mistress.


Adieu.


Come Hilaria.


Ha Hilaria! I faith that is she, but they are gone in; Jacinta I remember is
the name of Lovel's Mistress; till now I fancied the other was she, because
more brisk and airy. Well I Will find out Lovel, and we'll give 'em a visit


Sirrah; Dog.


Sir, I beseech you.


Rogue, I Will break your bones.


Mr. Justice, Sir, and please your worship, -- do but hear me.


I cannot hear of Mercy, Hunger cries louder against thee for Vengeance.


Have moderation Sir, in your Anger, -- Justice has a scale for Mercy, as well
as Rigor


Do thou see villainous Host, I am so weak and faint for want of Eating, I
can hardly follow thee


Sir, on my word you shall have an excellent Supper.


But disappointment Sirrah, -- did not thou prate to me of Bruges Capons,
Marrow puddings, and --


That was only and please your Worship to out-lie my Neighbor, he had no Gaunt
Veal, and please your Worship -- nor --


O I shall go into a Consumption, Sirrah! my fancy has mounted Constellation
height, -- I supped Jelly from the Stars in conceit, and now must I be content
with dry Mutton and Rabbit? --


I Will make amends to Morrow, Sir, at the Wedding Dinner, I Will send Man and
Horse round the Country to pick up dainties


But I have longings, Sirrah, I have longings more dangerous than a Woman's with
Child. O! I have wamblings in my Stomach


What thinks your Worship of a glass of Canary, -- I have a Flower.


Do, do, bring't, or I shall faint.


And to enable you till Supper, a slice of potted Venison.


Ay, ay, for I am like a Mud Wall falling to decay; I want patching up.


Mr. Justice, whilst I have leisure, let me desire the favor of you, to take
the care of providing and ordering a handsome entertainment against to morrow.
Spare for no cost


That Is well, that is well.


Let every thing be in the best manner, I leave it wholly and solely to you.


Both as to quantity, -- quality, -- manner, ordering, dressing, and every
thing


Every thing! --


Without Molestation, -- Contradiction, -- or control?


Absolutely and entirely.


I love to understand the extent of my Commission, now am I Lord over the
Boiled, -- Baked, and Roast


Mr. Justice, please you to taste?


Mr. Alderman, my service to you; special


Sir, here is some Gentlemen and a Lady enquire for you.


Oh our Friends are come! Show 'em in, and call down my Daughter.


Sir Barnaby, you are welcome.

I thank you Mr. Alderman, A good welcome is the best Dish at a Feast. This is
my half Brother, and this our Sister


Sir your Servant -- Madam give me leave --


Your Servant Sir, Sir your Servant, Madam your humble Servant.


Here Is my Daughter, Sir Barnaby bids you welcome.


He comes well that comes to a good end, -- Lady, your humble Servant, and
faithful Husband, till death us part


Your Servant Sir.


And now Father-in-Law -- tho I never saw you before, yet we understand one
another by letters, -- therefore let us fall to the matter, and spare
complements


Ay, Sir Barnaby, no matter for ceremony amongst Friends.


No, for Ceremony, is the Wiseman's scorn, the Fools delight, and the Idleman's
business


Ay, Sir Barnaby, I am for down right dealing --


That Is best, -- for Full of Curtisy, full of Craft -- and fair words will not
fill a Bushel. Here then is the mark I shoot at, I come to Marry your Daughter


Right --


You and I understand one the other, and Marriage Articles are agreed on
betwixt us


Right -- I writ you my mind to every particular.


Now Sir, knowing that Forecast is as good as Work, I have brought the Marriage
writings ready drawn, and my Attorney to see 'em signed and sealed, come hither
Dash --


Here and please your Worship's are the Deeds that concern your Estate, and
here the Marriage, Settlement, and Joynters, and so forth


Very well Sir Barnaby.


This I did to prevent expenses, for it is chargeable lying at Inns -- A penny
saved, is a penny got. And I have brought my Brother and Sister, that being
altogether, we may be so much the cheaper


They are welcome Guests, -- spare for nothing that the place affords.


I Love to Be merry and wise. Enough's as good as a Feast. And now Sir, whilst
you peruse the Writings, I Will open my mind to your Daughter; we shall soon have
done -- Few words are best amongst Friends


We'll withdraw into a another Room, and leave you to your selves. Come
Gentlemen


Look you after Joynters and Settlements -- I Will into my Kingdom, and take
possession of my new Office. I come ye Woodcocks, Pheasants, Patridges, and
Quales: O ye darlings of Nature, ye tempters of the Appetite, I am coming
amongst you, to hug kiss and embrace your beautiful limbs


Who does he mean?


I could even jump out of my Skin for joy; now will I Eat often, and give
thanks when my Belly's full: For I could never remember to say Grace before
Meat, in my Life


What say you Sir --


Say -- why I say Sir, Store is no Sore; and that is a better say, than Your
enough's as good as a Feast. Chew upon that Sir Barnaby, till I come again. --


This is some prodigal Glutton, I wonder Mr. Alderman will keep him company --
One scabby Sheep is enough to infect a whole Flock. But not to stand thruming
of Caps, my Wife that is to be -- I am now to tell you, that since your Father
and I are agreed, there only remains, that I open my breast to you in these
particulars. First, as to my Person, you see it well enough, there is nothing to
be disliked; nature has been sufficiently bountiful to me, I am As strait as an
Arrow; as plump as a Patridge; -- and as sound as a Roach. But it may be said,
I am of a full Age; -- the better for you. Better be an Old Man's darling, than
a Young Man's warling. And he that Marries ever he be wise, shall Die ever he
thrive. Now I found in my self an inclination to like you, the first and only
time I saw you -- which was last Year, when you were with your Uncle in our
Country, at the Sheriffs Feast. I don't say you took notice of me


No indeed Sir --


Hold, I don't ask you questions -- because I would not give you the trouble of
answering. Now as I had a liking to you at first sight -- So I know you must
have some inclination in nature, to think well of me for a Husband. For I
observe your Eye has been upon me ever since I came -- Looking breeds liking;
and Where the Eye fixes, the Heart soon follows. So there is an end of that.
Secondly, I am none of those that mind Fashions -- Wisemen invent Fashions, and
Fools follow 'em. I am rather for saving than spending, ever keeping in mind,
that, To save is Healthful, to get is Comfortable, but to spend is Intolerable.
Now my taking you for a Wife, shows what good Opinion I have of you, and that I
believe you to be prudent enough, to imitate so reasonable a Husband; for
without that and your Father's Three Thousand Pound, (which I would have with
you) I should never have Married you -- nor can I doubt you hereafter, since A
good Jack makes a good Jill. And from the moment I Marry you, I Will make you
Mistress of all I am worth, (upon condition) you lay not any of it out, upon
any occasion whatsoever


How Sir, not --


Hold again -- Marriage brings the Key that unlocks a Virgin's Mouth. Maids
must be seen, not heard. Lastly, to discover my whole Heart to you, because
Children are certain Cares, but uncertain Comforts; and because they will cost
a great deal bringing up, and moreover for that I love you so tenderly, we will
get but one or two at most, and than I will forbear making you afraid, lest you
should Die in Childbed, For the Pitcher goes not so often to the Well, but it
comes home broken at last. Thus having told you all that is necessary, and
finding you so reasonable, and we both so well agreed. I Will instantly acquaint
your Father, -- put all things in readiness to Night, be Married in the Morning
according to the Old Rule, -- Happy is the Wooing, that is not long a doing.
Adieu Wife


Two words to a bargain, the Proverb says; but he will not allow me one.


Cozen, I heard all your Courtship; you have a most Sententious Lover. You Will
be married to the whole Book of Proverbs


He would not let me speak a word, but is gone away with all the presumption
imaginable that I love him


It Is a strange Devil.


Which way shall I divert this ridiculous marriage? My Father will hearken to
nothing I can say


Here Is Mr. Lovell, he is the fittest person for you to consult with -- O
Gallant! who sent for you?


I hope, Madam, you will allow a man to look after his heart when it is gone
astray


You could not find it when you saw us last.


You conspired to juggle me out on it; but I know well enough which of you had
it


You are beholden to Mr. Lovell for your knowledge.


No, upon my word, Madam: But he has told me his last Adventure.


Well, Madam, I hope you will stand to your Bargain.


We are no Flinchers; we'll not be worse than our words.


Then I challenge you for my Mistress; you were the Lady I talked to in the
Mask.


I am not her I assure you.


I am well assured it could be none but you; I knew it when I was here before,
though I did not then own it


Take my word, Sir.


Lord, that you should think to deceive me! Why, all the while I was last in
your company, my heart beat all on that side you stood, and my cheek next you
burnt and glowed --


Ha, ha; 'slise, he has not found it out yet --


Ha --


No, I Will be sworn Careless have not you.


I Will be sworn, Madam, Hilaria was the person. --


Ha, ha, ha -- but that is my Cozen Jacinta.


No, no, no; did not you call her Hilaria as you went in?


Ha, ha, ha.


I thought how well you knew, and therefore called her by my own Name on
purpose to try you


Ba! --


Now Careless you are caught --


I must be impudent -- Well, Madam, to let you see that I did, go both of you
out of the Room, and come in Masked; and if I don't choose the right, I Will be
content to resign the hopes of a Mistress


There is but right and wrong.


To give you a greater proof on it, I Will make my choice blindfold.


'Twill still be an even Wager that you hit on the right.


Careless, you are outwitted in faith.


Servant, our Covenant is void for Nonperformance of the conditions.


But calling me Servant, after the condition is broken, it is a confirmation --
and will make it stand good in Law


No, Careless, that Quirk will not do.


But, Madam, I hope you will give a man leave to retract when he finds his Error;
your self occasioned the mistake, 'twas an error of my Hand, not of my Heart,
for at the same time I told you Hilaria was she, and you are Hilaria; therefore
'twas you I meant


Yes, yes, 'twas me you meant, when your Cheek glowed, and your Heart beat on
the left side


Ha, ha, ha -- Cozen, you are too great a Tyrant.


You pursue your Victory too severely; it is Generous to give the vanquished
Quarter


I do more, I give him liberty to make his Retreat.


Mr. Lovell, they want your company within -- to witness the Writings.
Daughter, you must go too


I Will wait on you again presently.


Sir, as you are Mr. Lovell's friend -- please to Sup with us, you shall be
welcome


Sir, I know not whither you will tell me so when you know my business.


Pray, what may it be?


It was my fortune this Evening to have a sight of your Niece, as she went
abroad


What Is he going to say?


To whom, Sir, I took so great a liking, that I could not rest satisfied till I
had found who she was; which I had no sooner done by Mr. Lovell, but engaged
him to bring me here to ask your consent to make my addresses to this fair Lady


O, I thought he would a been a second Sir Barnaby, and asked no bodies leave
but his


Pray, who are you, Sir?


Did you not know Colonel Careless?


Very well -- he died some ten years since.


He was my Father.


Indeed! He left, I think, some twelve hundred a year; but encumbered.


He did so.


And have you that Estate still?


Every Acre, Sir -- and the Mortgage paid off.


I heard you were very wild.


I have had my Frolicks, but keep my Estate out of the Devil's Clutches.


Nay, if you were as wild as wild could be, you would meet with your Match there;
My Niece is as wild as you can be, she is vain, idle, careless and talkative


Uncle, you should do in driving a Bargain for marriage, as in selling of
Horses; tell their good qualities, and leave it to them to find the ill


These are faults will be discovered in you at first sight.


Sir, I hope you will like me never the worse for what he says.


Instead of his getting you for a wife, you intend to get him for a Husband.


It is more to the humor of the Age; if you will not commend me, I Will commend my
self: And if I thought but half so well of him, as I do of my self, we'd soon
shake hands, to Have and to Hold, without your leave


You see her humor, Sir; if after this you dare venture on her, I shall not
Counsel her against you, provided you make out that Estate, for I wish her well
married


Stay, Uncle: Now I think on it, you may take him with you, marriage is quite
out of fashion, and I hate to be out on it as much as you do to be in it; if he
had ten or twelve thousand a year, would keep me a Coach and Six, and all
things suitable to that Grandeur, I might admit him as a Gallant; and all that


I Will leave you to her; for at this mad rate she talks all the year round.


Now the jest would be, if you should play such a simple trick to fall in Love
with me indeed, and indeed.


Make your own words true, and accept me for a Gallant, I know not what may
follow --


I Will push on the frolic at a venture, to see how far 'twill go; there is my
hand to kiss, and I confer on you the Title of Servant


So, here is one hopeful young man in a fair way to be ruined.


To morrow I shall be unhappy.


I pity your circumstances.


Look you Captain -- there is your friend.


Come, Captain -- how is it*


Why, these Towns are such places, that a man cannot tell where he is, though both
his Eyes are open. I can walk so all about my Frigate, Fore and Aft, in my
sleep, between Decks, or above Deck, and return into my Cabin without waking,
but here I am forced to have a Pilot to steer me broad awake


They want one Witness more, and desire you --


Captain, I leave you in good company; I Will be with you presently.


Who is this?


A brave Sea-Captain -- Stout and Blunt -- he was Born in a Ship, and scarce
knows any thing of Land Affairs


He looks as ruff as a Storm.


I like him well; he looks as if fighting was his business.


He Is not very curious in his Dress.


Captain, how do you like these Ladies?


Three very snug Frigates, well Rigged; 'twere pity too but they were as well
Manned


Ever you come Aboard one of these -- you must be new Rigged your self; I must
carry you to a Wardrobe


What place is that, do they fight or Drink there?


It Is a Storehouse for the Body, you must lay by this Sea habit for a Land
Dress, the Ladies will not like the smell of Pitch and Tar


Not like it! Which of them will not like it?


He Will beat us anon.


I begin to be afraid.


But what do you with these Ladies here?


Court them, Gallant them.


What Is that?


We make love to them: You must have a Mistress now you are come ashore.


Must I? Which of them?


Her you like best, Captain


I like them all; I am for a whole Tier of them.


Every man must have his share -- make choice of her you think handsomest.


But how must a man know a handsome Woman?


Here Is a Pattern to choose by -- observe:


That Is fine.


A Chin dimpl'd; in that little Pit a thousand Hearts lie Buried.


They are thrown in then, as fast as we heave Dead men overboard in a Sea
Fight


Well said, Captain.


A Neck smooth, fat, white, and soft as the down on Swans.


Ay, that --


Breasts hard and round, their motions pant beholders Hearts into an ecstasy;
they rise and fall like Waves blown up by gentle Winds. -- Do but lay your hand
here, Captain.


O, O, feel here!


Ah! your heart beats high, we shall have boisterous weather anon -- I perceive
it coming


How. is it Captain?


My heart begins to leap and play like a Porpice before a Storm.


Look you here, Captain -- an Arm and Hand small, white and plump, the vaulting
Blood blushing through the fair skin like a Lawn. Veil* spread o'r a Bed of
Roses. Touch her Captain.


Oh, how fine it is to stroke such Limbs.


Beauty, I see, will soften and polish him.


Now tell me Captain, what do you think of me?


As of a Woman.


Is that all?


Why, a Woman's the finest thing I ever saw, except a Cannon Mounted, and a
Ship under Sail


Now Captain, if you like her, claim her for your Mistress: Love her, Court
her, Gallant her, and do your best. -- Win her and wear her; that is fair play


Will you give her me?


If you can get her.


Why, I can take her up in my Arms and run away with her.


And whither would you carry me?


Aboard -- and he that dares come to take you from me there, had as good leap
into a Blazing Fireship, or kiss Thundr


But I am no Lawful Prize, if you take me by force: By the Laws of Love you
must Court me, and win me fairly


You must get her good Will, Captain.


I thought I had her Will when I had her -- but now I think on it I have been
told, That a Woman's Will shifts more Points than the Wind. But if she Sail any
Point of the Compass, I Will hale her in I warrant you


Well said Captain.


I Will hold you Chase I warrant you --


Have a care of Storms.


And look you don't slip your Anchor, Captain.


Come, come, here you stand Chit chat, and forget the main business of Life;
Supper's on the Table and half cold. Walk in and line your Christmas Coffers,
come


Well advised, Mr. Justice, they that will not follow set them in the Stocks. --
This is the Jolliest old Blade for Eating! His Mouth's like a Mill, always
grinding -- Come Servant, Usher me in handsomely


I Will Eat and Drink to enable my self in your Service.


Captain, you shall be my Guest; you are not arrived to that degree yet to live
by Love


I Will take in a little Ballast, that I may Sail the Stiffer.


GEntlemen, you are all welcome: Sir Barnaby, my service to you. O, Mr. Dash,
where are you? -- Come, take a Chair and sit down


O Lord, Sir, I dare not presume --


Come, come, sit down -- sit down.


At your Worship's Table! I have more Breeding; an't please you, I Will Sup with
the Gentlewoman, by her leave, when you have done


Sir Barnaby, pray speak to him to sit down.


Sit down -- Better be unmannerly than troublesome.


No offense, I hope.


No, no, sit down.


Reach him his Hat there.


Let it lie, Friend.


Reach it him, I say.


I beseech your Worship*


Put it on.


By no means.


Put it on his head.


I beseech your Worship hold me excused: I am a poor Scribe.


Be it better, or be it worse, be ruled by him that bears the Purse.


Your Worships are wiser than I am.


A pure fellow this, he sits as if he were afraid of the Table.


Friend, you cannot reach.


Draw your Chair nearer.


I thank your Worship.


Shove it nearer the Table for him.


Very well, I thank you friend.


Nearer yet.


So, very well, very well; so, so, very well, very well.


Friend, My Service to you.


O Lord -- And please your Ladyship, Drink to me!


Keep -- keep your Seat friend.


Madam, your poor Scribe thanks you. --


Drink to me Mr. Dash, I Will pledge you.


Your Ladyship must excuse me; I dare not be so bold. Mistress, my Service to
you.


Thank you Sir.


Look you, Madam, he is a very well-bred man.


Give me a Glass of Wine -- here is ado about nothing -- I am -- almost choked
with all this Ceremony


Now fall to, Friend.


Thank your Worship, I don't spare*


Unfold your Napkin Mr. Dash.


It Is very well, I heartily thank your Ladyship.


Spread it before you, you will grease your Clothes.


I thank you kindly -- I have a Handkerchief for that.


Sir Barnaby, your Ladies health to you.


I thank you, Sir.


You don't Eat heartily Sir Barnaby.


I am no great Supper-man.


Don't you eat Suppers?


Seldom: One Meal a day makes a Man healthy and wealthy.


On one Meal a day we may live, on two we may thrive, but three must make us
fat. And I say, Sir Barnaby -- Eat and be Rich, Fast and dye in a Ditch. Come,
come, Hunger breeds Knaves: A full Belly thinks least harm


I am for what is wholesome: Light Suppers make clean Sheets.


But my Grannam taught me better -- When the Belly's full the Bones are at
rest: Eat nothing and Dream of the Devil


Several Men several Minds; I sleep best without. Custom is a second Nature.


Sir Barnaby, Ill Customs are better broken than kept: If I went Supperless to
Bed, my Guts would croak all Night like Frogs in a Fishpond


Nature is bent to its own Ruin: Gluttony destroys more than the Sword.


Monstrum Horrendum; that men can hold Arguments against their Bellies.


How now Mr. Dash.


I have Supped I thank you -- and now I Will wait upon your Worship.


No, no -- take his Plate and Napkin there --


Let me set it by.


Excuse me there, forsooth, I understand better.


Here are two Women enquire for Mr. Justice Greedy.


For me? I Will not stir from Table for no body: Cannot a man eat in quiet? I Will
throw up my Commission


O Sir, let them come in.


If it be Justice business we may have some sport.


Call them in -- Come forward, what is your business?


We are come and please you, to make Oath against a person that is fled to this
Town to be married, and disowns both us and his Children


Who is it?


One Sir Barnaby Buffler.


Here he is, speak to his face.


O Sir Barnaby, have we found you!


Were you so cunning, to go so far from home to steal a marriage, that we might
not hear on it? -- But we are here to forbid the Banes


What mean you Woman?


Ah Gentlemen, wonder not at us, for this wicked Sir Barnaby, five years ago,
tempted my honesty, and with solemn promises of marriage prevailed over my
weakness, and got me with Child


What! and eat no Suppers.


How Is this!


And to increase my sorrow, -- I had two at a birth.


What, and he Eat no Suppers.


O rare Sir Barnaby.


Hold you your Clack Gossip.


An impudent Queen -- I never saw her -- I should not know her if I had met her
in my Dish


If I had never known you, I had never


Alas poor Woman.


Mind her not, she is a queen; It Is no more pity to see her Weep, than to see a
Goose go barefoot


You Will say you don't know me too, I warrant you.


What has Sir Barnaby been Tennant to your Copyhold too.


Even so to my sorrow.


What, both!


A Couple of Carryons -- Never a Barrel better Herring.


Come, come, here is matter for me,


Ay Mr. Justice, take 'em Coram nobis.


I Will examine these matters according to Authority.


Tho he will not know us, let us see if he don't know these, come here Children,
kneel Johnny, -- kneel down little Sarah, ask Father blessing, and let us see if
he can be so unnatural to disown his own Flesh and Blood


And do thou kneel Tommy, ask blessing --


Pray Father -- pray Daddy -- pray Father, pray Daddy.


Pray Father, pray Daddy.
Pray Father, pray Daddy.
You Jackdaw's you, hold your gaping.

Come before Justice -- here you that han't told your story yet. -- But first,
what is your name


Elizabeth Breeder.


And Yours.


Sarah Dazie, and please you --


And what come you for? what is your complaint?


And please your Worship Mr. Justice.


Speak out --


And please you this Sir Barnaby --


Well, -- but first what are you --


I am a very honest Farmer's Daughter --


I believe it would a been better for you, that you had been a Farmer's honest
Daughter


I had been so and please you, -- had it not been for Sir Barnaby.


Why, what did he do?


He knows well enough, what was done in the great barn.


What he thrash'd you there did he?


Here is the fruit of his labor, hold up thy Head Tommy; look you Gentlewoman,
is he not as like, as if he was spit out of his Mouth


He has his very Eyes, and the make of his Face.


And see here a pair of pretty Twins, so like the Father.


These have his Nose, his Forehead, and Chin exactly.


It cannot be denied, but they are pretty Children.


Ye all Dream, they are neither like, nor pretty -- nor nothing. These are
impudent queans


This is an abuse to my Brother, designed to hinder his Marriage.


It Is combination, Mr. Justice, take care of these baggages: Let 'em kiss the
Whipping-post


Let me alone. Mrs. Breeder, you say these two Children were begotten on your
natural body, by Sir Barnaby, and born out of lawful Wedlock


Yes Sir, but not without a Contract.


Well, stand you by -- but hold, hold, -- one question or two more. What were
you when this was done


A Chambermaid.


And this was your Chamber practice, what, he did not Ravish you, did he?


Not against my Will.


Ha, ha, ha.


They both Lie faster, than a Dog can trot.


Trouble not your self Sir Barnaby, they have both confessed that these are
bastard Children, consequently themselves to be Whores, I Will send 'em to the
house of Correction


No, I lay claim to him for my Husband.


And so do I.


And the Whipping post lays claim to you both. Come, give me Pen, Ink, and
Paper, I Will make their Mittimus


Here and please your Worship, I have both.


Now Baggages, present, present --


A word and please your Worship --


Well! --


Here is a Collar of Brawn, which my Father sends you as a token of his
respect, for your prudent moderation in this affair


Humph -- Brawn -- Brawn! -- I say you are a notorious Baggage. Rare Brawn,
rare Brawn!


It Is ready sou^'d for your Worships Eating.


Speak softly -- abuse so worthy a Person as Sir Barnaby! rare Brawn, there
will be no living without Justice; delicate Brawn. -- I Will make you an example.
-- Set it behind my Chair, rare Brawn, rare Brawn


He swallows the bribe.


The Jades act it well.


Mr. Justice.


What, now you will Sing the second part to the some Tune, will ye.


My Mother has sent your Worship, this couple of fat Capons, for a present.


Dainty Birds, speak for you! hang you. --


She was dairy Maid to your Worship's Mother. --


No, no, Not I -- you are a most impudent strumpet -- dainty birds, dainty
birds


They are of her own Cramming.


Softly -- abuse such a Person as Sir Barnaby; dainty birds indeed! I Will swinge
you both, -- dainty birds. I am enraged, I shall never be able to do Justice
with moderation. I Will -- I Will -- I Will -- Ah -- dainty birds


Mr. Justice, being these Women are come a great way, and have small Children
to provide for, were it not better to lend 'em home again, than to keep 'em
here, and put the Town to charge


Od's life, old Sir, discharge 'em; or let me be their bail.


Truly Sir, my Heart is mollified, I think with you 'twere best to send them
back to their own Country, and Sir Barnaby may do well to give 'em a small Sum
to bear their charges back


Hang 'em -- Not a Cross to bless themselves with -- even let 'em go Byard on
Ten-toes for me


Well, here is Angels a piece upon condition, they trouble us no more with this
clammer


We thank your Worship.


Dainty birds -- dainty birds.


And hereafter, if we find good ground for what you say, I Will prevail with Sir
Barnaby, to allow some thing yearly for maintainnance of your Children


Dainty Birds --


Thank you Sir, -- thank you.


Go, go, get you gone -- you are beholden to these Friends.


Go Johnny -- go Sarah, you may never see your Father more, therefore ask him
blessing


Ay, do Tommy, ask Father blessing too.


Pray Father -- pray Father.


Bastards, Whores-birds! the Devil take ye all.


Pray Father -- pray Daddy, etc.


Follow him Children, follow him.


Pray Father, -- pray Daddy, --


Ha, ha, ha, --


Poor Infants.


Hark you, hark you, Frailties; the boul of Punch is ready, the Captain and I
will come and be merry with you for an hour --


We'll expect you.


Your Servant Sir.


Madam, my Spark and your Captain, I suspect by that whisper are wickedly bent
-- I over heard a paw word


Come Gentlemen, let us deliver Sir Barnaby from the Philistines, and bring him
back


Ay, we'll all help, we'll drive away the Whores, I warra^^ you.


Will you so, we'll watch your motions -- come Madam.


It Is even as you say --


Rare Brawn -- delicate Brawn -- dainty Birds -- dainty Birds --


Mr. Justice -- rare Brawn, delicate Brawn -- rare Birds, dainty Birds --


You are a wag, you are a wag, Mr. Dash, bring the Collar after me.


You see Sir, what a Person you are going to Marry me to.


This is nothing, at best, but a trick of Youth, many a Woman would be glad to
see so good proofs of a Man, that is to be her Husband, mind you his Estate


What is a Wife better for an Estate, when he is so Covetous.


Thrift will increase it -- 'twill be all your Children's.


He Is Jealous too.


You call that Jealousy which is prudence.


And obstinate.


Humor him --


And Conceited.


Say as he says.


And slovenly.


Great Wits are generally so. Do you not observe, that every word he speaks is
a sentence


His is old fashioned -- Grandmother Wit -- he is a mere bundle of Proverbs,
-- I shall have him -- nick name'd -- and called my Solomon


You are a Fool to argue so against your own good*


Besides, Sir, he is Old.


He Will Die the sooner, go -- there is a salve for that sore* Here he comes,
compose your self. --


These Carrions have put me Quite out of my Bias, I can Get into my right
geers again, on the sudden


Hang 'em -- think no more on 'em.


Now Father-in-law, to draw to a conclusion in our affair.


The sooner the better.


And to end all in a word, for A word to the Wise is sufficient.


Very good.


The Marriage writings being signed and sealed betwixt us --


They are so --


And I being to Marry your Daughter to Morrow, For delay are dangerous.


True.


Than I may now account her as my Wife.


You may so --


Than there is but one thing more remains necessary to be done to night.


What Is that?


Considering that she is as my Wife, -- and that we are lodged here in a
public Inn -- where there are some passengers already, and may yet be many
more -- and that Inns are subject to disturbances at any hour, it will be more
for her safety and my honor, that she be this night put under my guard and
protection. She shall be lodged in the Chamber, betwixt mine and my Brothers,
where we can both of us, hear and be ready if occasion should require. For many
things fall out, betwixt the Cup and the Lip, and That may happen in a Minute,
that does not otherwise fall out in an Age, and It is better to prevent a
mischief, than to remedy it


It is so. Be it as you please Sir Barnaby.


I do than require, that you now deliver your Daughter to me, with your own
proper hand -- with all your right, title, claim, and interest that you have in


Here Sir --


Observe Gentlemen -- say after me, -- I deliver to you, my Daughter -- etc.


I deliver to you my Daughter,


So, I love to do all things with discretion, and to make all things sure, Fast
bind, fast find


A fine Bargain indeed.


You act very prudently, Sir.


A thing -- once well done, is twice done. And now Sir, you shall see how
punctual I will be to you* Dash give me the little Paper I gave you


Here and please you.


Reach me the Pen and Ink --


Hum -- m -- m -- hum -- m -- m -- ah --


See Gentlemen, I take off the Seal; here Sir, I deliver you this -- before
Witness


What is it? --


Read it I pray, I think it is right.


I Do acknowledge to have had and received of and from Mr. Benjamin Furr,
Alderman and Citizen of London, his sole and only Daughter, called and known by
the Christian name of Jacinta, with all her Conditions and Qualities, be they
good or bad, with all absolute promise, full intent and purpose, on my part, to
make her my true and lawful Wedded Wife, by Ten of the Clock to Morrow-morning,
being the third of May, and the Day following the Date of this present writing
-- In Testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my Hand and Seal

Barnaby Buffler.


So, now do you two Witness it.


Witness.


Was ever the like extravagance.


What can be the meaning of this Receipt, does he think I lend or sell him my
Daughter


No matter -- it is his fancy, -- it does you no hurt.


Now Sir, I Will see my Wife safe up to her Chamber, and bid you all good Night.


For Bed already Sir Barnaby?


Ay, Early to Bed, and early to Rise,
Will make a Man Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise.

Heaven send my Daughter to do well, -- this Receipt will not out of my mind. But
come, she is Married to a good Estate, and that covers a multitude of faults


Ay, ay, well enough -- dainty Birds -- dainty Birds. --


Come, where is this bowl of Punch?


There Madam --


Tell me Mother, pray now do, etc.


She got Money by it, she got Money by it, etc.


Merry Girls Captain.


Cheary my Mates, cheary.


Courage Captain -- give me your hand, I love a Tarpaling at my heart.


Come, let us drink about, my service to you.


My service to you! there is a sneaking compliment, you would have said as much to
an honest Woman


I cannot talk at your rate, but if you are for Ship shape language, downright
drinking, or will come to grapling, I am for you


Bid the Music come in Ladies, the Captain has brought his Boats crew to
entertain you with a Song and a Dance


By your leave Gallants, I am come to be merry with you, and have brought a
couple of young Friends with me, they are going to Travel, to Morrow they are
for Dover


They are welcome into our Cabin, I wish we had better entertainment.


What, are not honest Gentlemen, handsome Girls, a bowl of Punch, and good
Music entertainment


I fear we shall be uncivil --!


That you can hardly be in our Company.


Lord, these are the two prettiest Youths!


I long for a kiss of 'em.


You may Sing, Drink, Swear, Roar, and Ruffle, and do as you please.


They came of a good kind,


By your leave Ladies.


Come, now ^owze it away.


Every one his Dish. Ladies your Healths.


Your Healths Ladies.


Your Healths Ladies.


Ay, ay, about with it.

I have a thirsty Soul,
Than give me a full Boul,
And let me drink, without Control.
In spite of the Vicar, and his dull teaching.
We'll take of our Liquor, and never mind his preaching;
Let him Damn us to the Pit hole.

There Is something in that.


Come, let us have the other dish, Sir, to you.


And to you Captain.


Come, about Ship, all hands aloft.


Now, Sir, pledge me on this Ladies Lips, three go downs upon reputation.


And Captain, pledge me the like here.


Two brisk little Devils.


I told you they were no Mongrels.


Where will you meet us.


Steal to the Inn over the way.


Bid the Chamberlain show you into Justices Chamber.


You Will not fail to follow.


What, whispering! It spoils company.


Mum.


Enough.


I beg your pardon.


Sir, a Messenger has brought you this Letter, and stays for an Answer.


We'll take this opportunity.


Away, away, you luscious Jades to my Chamber, mind your Q. hum -- Captain, my
service to you -- I have a thirsty Soul, etc


What Is here, a Billet doux. GAllant, I know not what is the cause, but I am
very Melancholy, pray come and spend an hour or two with me, ever I go to Bed,
for I find I have an inclination to your company, perhaps the sight of you may
cure me. Bring the Captain along with you, to divert his Lady, for she is in
the dumps too

Hillaria.

This it is to have the company of honest Women, they presently grow troublesome.


Why Sir?


If they be of the dull sober sort, a Man can hardly get acquaintance with
them, but they fall flat in love; if of a spritely gay humor, they presently
grow impertinent, and will ever be sending such notes as these to a Man, or
running after him


But is she handsome, that gives you this invitation?


Yes, hang her, she is well enough.


Than you should take it for a kindness.


But I wonder Women han't the Wit to know when a Man cares for their Love, or
their company; for to be sure, when he has a mind to either, he will be coming or
sending to them


Will Not you make sail toward them?


Do you think I Will leave good sociable company, for a dull honest Wench.


She Will take it ill.


I have a better Opinion of her Wit, than to think she would desir't, if she knew
how the case stands -- boy bid the Messenger tell her he cannot find me; I Will
make such visits, when I have no better company -- but where are our Women


They went out just as you began to read the Letter.


Hum -- come let us mind our Punch. -- I have a thirsty Soul --


Was this your whispering; young Squire, you don't play me fair play, you ought
not to take up another Man's Dice. -- And Captain, where is your Lady


What has she set her sails too, and stole away like a Cowardly Enemy in a dark
night


Go down Boy, we'll pay below.


I do it by way of reprisal, you took one from me, and we have got two from you.


I take one from you.


Yes, I have had a long Intreague with a Lady named Hillaria, I have followed
her from London, and here I find you are become her Servant


I was ignorant of any such pretensions.


I shall spoil your Markets theretoo; and tell her that she is impertinent to
send after you -- and all that -- and when you can find no better company,
you will come to her -- and all that


Nay, than I Will take another course with you. Come Sir.


Ay, now there is some work toward, I have lost my Pinace too, which is he that
I am to give a broad side to


I have a Sword to entertain you, as fierce as you look.


God -- a mercy little Piccaroon, huzza -- away with it.


Keep the peace in the King's name. -- I Will steal after the Women, I am
enflamed with Punch, and they shall lay the fumes.


Surely Sir, you will not be so Mad to fight for one you don't Love.


Look you Sir, tho I scorn to tell her so, or any of her Sex, yet I do Love
her, will Love her, must Love her, and no body else shall Love her


But I do, will, and shall Love her better than you.


Come, give me a proof on it then.


Yes, Sir, I will give you a proof on it --


And mine there.


What do you think of me, now my Manhood's off.


And Captain, how do you like a Woman in Breeches?


Hey, how wind you now!


Alas poor Gallant! observe how you are cheated of your Mistresses, -- ha, ha,
-- farewell Gallant


And Captain stick to your bowl of Punch.


Hark you, stay --


No, Women are so impertinent, Men will come after them, when they Love 'em;
Adieu.


Gad, they are too unconsciable to deprive us of our Women, and than to run
away themselves. And now she knows I love her, she will insult over me, what
shall's do Captain


I Will observe what course you steer, I Will sail in your Wake.


And those two Jades, to serve us such a trick! I thought they had some honor
in 'em, but --

I find that Women are by Nature guilty,
For be they Whores, or not Whores, they will gilt ye.

THE truth is, she played the Tyrant with you, but you deserved that, and more.


Were not the use and conversation of Women absolutely necessary for Mankind, I
would forswear the whole Sex


I know by the Constitution of your body, you would not be able to keep that Oath
long. Yet I advise you to forswear all but one


That is, you would have me Marry.


Yes, you would find more comfort in a Wife, than in ten Mistresses.


If what you say be true; why do most Husbands in this Age, (which I take to be
wiser than any that is past,) turn away their Wives, and keep Wenches? at least,
those that are so civil to live with a Wise, maintain a Mistress beside


And if it be not true, why do the great Debauchees at last, forsake all their
Mistresses for a Wife? we find most of 'em Marry at the long run; nay generally
they prove the best Husbands. The Reason is, they have experimented the folly
of that lewd course of Life


I had never so good an Opinion of Marriage as now, for this Dog trick; these
two jilting Jades showed me, in leaving us so in the lurch, has lessened 'em in
my esteem, to the degree of honest Women, and now the scales are even, the
first of either party that obliges me, draws it down on that side


Than Hillaria I hope, will turn the balance.


If the Devil is minded to loose a Gamster, let him venture to make her and me
Friends


And he will, for here she comes to work your Conversion for which end, i will
leave you together.


How now Gallant?


O Madam! --


You are very merry Gallant.


I have no Reason to be otherwise.


And why do you jostle me?


You walk in my way.


It Is you walk in mine.


Get farther off.


Go you farther off.


I was here first.


Than you may begone first.


I have business here.


What, to see me?


No, with Mr. Lovell.


Yes in my Conscience, you was coming to see me.


Now I think on it, so I was on purpose, to let you know that I am alive; for I
believe you thought, I had either Hanged my self for the trick you put on me,
or had broke my Heart, with sighing for your absence, with whom I am so
desperate in Love* but believe me, I have not yet broke so much as a button,
and may I break my Neck when I do, either for Love of you, or any Woman living


Yet Spark you love me.


It Is true, I love you well enough; because you are unlucky; and was not
honesty in the case, I should love you better, but as it is, you are in a
desperate condition


Must I than despair?


You are for Matrimony, and that I hate, I can no more endure a Wife, than a
standing Dish of Meat


You think than I am in Love with you.


Think it! ha, ha, -- as tho I did not know that, by your following me, up and
down, what came you for after me? and for what come you to talk with me now, if
you an't in Love with me? and what made you seduce the Woman from me, but that
you might have me all to your self


I vow now you put me in mind on it, I may be in Love with you; but you say my
case is desperate, then desperate must be the Cure, and I must even resolve to
be your Mistress, Wench, or what you will called


That Is your only Remedy -- I am a Bird of Prey, and fly at all.


Nay than I am a Dead Woman still, for you will soon take a flight from me to
another


But when I have caught my prey, I take my Belly full of it; I never leave it
till I am gorged


And will your Stomach come again.


Yes, sometimes, but generally some ravenous Fowl or another, picks up my
leavings, and flies away with it


But would you have no more care of me.


My care would signify but little; for a Man seldom finds either Money or a
Woman, in the same place he left 'e


But is it not a point of Honor amongst you Men, not to leave the Women you
debauch, but if they prove Constant, to provide for 'em


Provide for 'em! is it not enough we teach 'em a Trade, by which they may get
their livings. But you will not want providing for, you have a good Portion,
but if I would, you your self in a short time would be for change


Well Careless, we'll do nothing rashly, I Will to Bed and consult with my
Pillow, and to morrow tell you more of my mind


But let me give you this caution, be not deceived with the vain considerations
of Virtue, Modesty, Chastity, Honor, Reputaion, and the like, these are
Bugg-words, that awed Women in former Ages, and still fool a great many in
this. And if once these idle notions get into your thoughts, I shall give you
over for a lost Woman


The common practice of my Sex, may prevail much; evil example makes twenty
Sinners to the black Gentleman's one. Adieu


So much for her, Captain, how is it with you, you look as if you were not well.


I am not, I have a wild Fire in my Veins, my blood is a circulating flame, it
spouts against the upper Region of my brain, like a tempestuous Hurricane


By your description this should be Love; that is the disease torments you; Love
plays mad wreaks, when first it enters a breast and finds resistance


Love!


Yes, Love like the small Pox, as any seldom escape it, so the more dangerous
it is, when it comes late


I don't know, but I have had strange turmoyls and combustions in my fancy ever
since your friend gave me that description, and showed me the Lady; I have been
looking for her


See she is under sail, she will be up with you presently.


Captain, -- what execution have my Eyes done -- are you in Love yet?


You have fired your upper Teer, you have peppered me with small shot.


Yes, Madam, he is furiously infected with Love, but can you tell him how to
cure his Disease


To cure Love, he must look for Love again.


There Is encouragement for you -- bear up close, speak to her Captain.


I could speak better to the great Guns of an Armada, whose Oratory is nothing
but Fire and noise


Board her to rights, briskly.


If I was but once master of her Forecastle.


That Is easy, she is leaky Captain, -- she is leaky.


Than she will founder anon.


Madam, afford him your hand; so now I have brought you to grapling, I Will vere
off, and give you Sea room, get clear of one another as you can.


Can you Love?


Yes Captain.


Me; by the North Star, say but that word, and this Sword, if you command,
shall Unpeole half the World,


I have no great skill.


Feel, has it not a brave edge, and what a point is here!


It Is dangerous meddling with edge Tools, pray put it up.


Have you any Enemies? if you have --


No Captain, put it up.


Will you Love me then?


I Love not danger; any thing but killing.


Did you never see one killed?


No.


No! had you but been with me in our last Engagement, you might have seen a
sight, that would have made a Coward in love with Death. There you would have seen
our Enemies bear up in a half Moon, exposing to our view, the terror of their
wooden Castles, the Mouths of their great Guns, which were made to swallow Iron
Morsels, that might lie heavy upon their Stomachs, till they were disgorg'd in
our Faces


Fau -- fau --


We, with Topsails out, Flags and Streamers flourishing in the Wind, and
Trumpets sounding, unite our force; than like Thunder fall in amongst them;
there like the Sons of Terror, we are seen in Clouds of Fire and Smoke, The
Slaughter now begins --


Hold good Captain.


We play at Tennis with Iron balls, and Death comes whisting by our Ears, Heads
take Fire in their Brain pans, and burst in sunder like Grenades, scattering
the wild Fire of their Brains in their fellow Soldiers Faces


You fright me horribly.


Other Heads, fly from one Ship with the Bullets that saluted them, to visit
their friends in another. Limbs like Langrel-Shot, mount, scattering in the
Air, and hands that could not reach their Enemies before, now fly into distant
Vessels, to give their Foes a box of the Ear; other hands grasping their Swords,
clear a whole Deck in their flight


What shall I do!


We are now in a confusion, the Fireships flame, and their half Moon is
divided -- into blazing Stars


O quarter, Captain, quarter!


Some burn, the Men leap over board, and drown themselves to save their lives;
other Ships real drunk, with the Sea brine, and at last sink to the bottom, to
follow these brave Men, who fought in 'em, with as much Courage, as they drank


Have you yet done?


The Flags and Pendants.


Yet more --


That hung wantonly playing in the Air, now on the Decks lie stian'd in blood,
and their tant Masts are brought by the Board, and lie on their Hull 's as in
Coffins. -- how like you it, is it not brave


I am almost Dead with fear.


I thought you valiant; did not I see you draw your Sword.


In Land matters I am Courageous, but in Sea affairs a mere Coward; their very
terms are Bullets to me, I would not hear such another relation --


Not hear! can you fear when I stand by? my voice is gentle, but I have
something that can speak louder to your Enemies, see --


What Is that, a Pistol?


It Is the spawn of a Cannon, a little spit-Fire Devil.


Pray Conjure him down again.


Frighted at my voice! you shall hear what a brave Language this speaks.


What noise is this?


Ah!


Gone -- I Will after her, and give her the other salute.


Murder -- murder, help.


Oh! Sir, what is the matter?


I am shot, I am shot.


Shot Sir!


I am shot, as sure as a Gun, I am shot.


I don't see you bleed.


It may be the Bullet stops the hole, and will not let the blood come out.


Shall I run for a Surgeon --


But where, All is not in hand, that helps. Look honest Dash, and see what I
ail


Please your Worship to stand up --


What! before I know whether I am killed or not.


I see no signs on it -- do you feel any hurt, do you think you are killed?


Dash. I think I don't feel any, but Thoughts are deceitful; look, look, The
Stander by sees more than a Gamester


It has missed you, Sir.


Then a Blot's no Blot till it he hit. I durst have sworn I had been killed,
for he shot me down as flat as a Flounder: But all is not lost that is in
Danger. And give a Man Luck and throw him into the Sea


Did your Worship see no Body?


Who ever it was, they thought One pair of heel's worth two pair of Hands; they
ran for it, As if the Devil drove 'em


Will not your Worship follow 'em.


Let 'em go, Make a golden Bridge for a flying Enemy. It Is Wisdom to keep out
of harms way. Take the Candle, let us see if all be safe here, and that the
noise has not wakened Jacinta, then we'll to Bed again. -- Ha -- her Door is
open -- what can the meaning be at this time of Night -- Dash, look in and see,
if any body be there, whilst I compose my self -- hum -- hum -- I had like to
have Paid for my peeping


No Sir -- there is no body.


It Is good to be sure, let us us go in then, Seeing is believing.


Surely I heard talking -- but all is whist -- Here, here, you may venture out.


Is any body stirring.


Not a Mouse --


I heard a noise ever since we went to Bed.


So did I.


It may be the Cook is stirring -- I charged him to call me before day, for I
am Overseer general of the Kitchen, besides my Stomachs up, and I can lie a Bed
no longer


I swear, Mr. Justice, I shall have a better Opinion of a Man that has a good
Stomach, as long as I live, for your sake


Ay, ay, Good at Meat, good at Work.


You are a brisk old blade, to venture on two at once.


I begin to grow Old, but the time was, when I could have been froliksome with
two and two, my Girls -- but hark, the House is up -- I hear the chopping
Knives at work upon the Dressers -- they will be coming to call me -- slip down
stairs and get into some by Room, and make your selves ready there


I see light at the bottom of the stairs, we cannot go down yet without being
seen


Than we'll in here again.


No, no, here, I feel a door open -- this is some room that no body lies in.


Where --


Here -- here -- In -- in -- so -- now I Will into my Chamber, make my self
ready,


Ah Madam Jacinta! is it so, out of your Bed at this time of Night.


O Lord, Sir, there is another random shot.


We'll retire into our Castle then -- Forewarned, Fore-arm'd.


Ah --


Sure she will love me anon.


I told you Madam, you should see sport.


How you tremble Madam!


O the Captain's in his hot* fit, and I am in my cold?


What has he done to you?


Frighted me horribly; he has not spoke a word, but was as terrible, as the
roaring of Cannon


The Captain would be a rare Physician to cure Ladies of the Ague -- if
fighting 'em can do it


What was you doing Captain.


Only saluting his Mistress.


Right, I gave her a Gun, that is Sea Courtship.


Your complement was very loud -- you should first have given her a fair
summons to surrender, and seen if she would have yielded upon Parley. Did you think
to take her Heart by storm, as Man do Towns


It was more like a Soldier.


But not like a Lover, Love is a gentle passion -- but Madam, admit him again
into your service -- he will forget he is a Soldier, and turn Courtier for your
sake


No, let him still retain his valor, but not express his Love, in such
terrible Rhetoric


I know not how to Court you in a Silken phrase, but if down right reallity
will do it, I Will be your friend both board and larboard


Than Captain, out with all your Sails, top and top-gallant, you shall be my
Lover


Well performed, Madam.


Whilst I my Heart under your conduct steer,
No Coasting Pyrate, Lovers I, nor Rovers fear.

Well, now Lovers I think it is time for you all to be at rest, but my Cousen
here, I pity at my Heart, to morrow is her execution day, and I dare swear, she
had rather 'twere for Hanging, than Marrying


O Hillaria! that word has damped all my mirth, I had else gone to Bed again,
with some pleasure, for the Captains courtship had quite put to morrow out of
my thoughts. But it is late -- I Will bury my cares in my Pillow -- and trust all
to providence


I Will bear you company this Night as a friend does an acquaintance, that is to
be trust up the next morning; and all the time we cannot sleep, we'll Sing no
other Letany, than -- From an old overgrown Looby, and from Sir Barnaby Booby
-- goodness deliver thee. Good night Servant --


Good night, unluckiness.


Arabella, I Will see you to your Chamher.


Good night Gentlemen.


Bonos noches, bonos noches. I think it is now time for us to turn in too.


But now I think on it, what is become of our two Whores, must we give 'em over
so


Ah -- ah --


Your Whores Gentlemen! here are your Whores.


How Sir Barnaby!


Ha, Madam Jacinta -- I find you are a Canarybird -- out of your Nest, at this
time of Night


Whores, said the Beast.


No better nor no worse, are these trappings fit for a Ladies Chamber? there
has bren Rantum scantum doings within, the Bed's turned Topsy Turvy, Men's
Clothes and Women's, thrown Higeldy Pigeldy; whilst some are at it, Helter
skelter, arsy versy, hand over head, and the Devil and all


What a Pox is all this -- I am a shark, if I understand one syllable of what
he says


Sir Barnaby, is this fit language for you to give Ladies, in Gentlemen's
Company


What does he affront the Ladies -- have at his main-top -- I Will shatter his
Tackling.


Hold Captain --


What Is here? Civil Wars, and homebred Combustions -- keep the Peace.


Put up Captain.


Affront the Ladies -- I Will rake him from stem to stern.


Keep the Peace in the King's name.


Forbear --


Sir Barnaby, what is the matter?


The matter is, that Old Birds will not be caught with Chaff. Mr. Alderman, I
thank you for your fine Daughter; but you shall not find, Sir Barnaby, the Man you
take him for, Some wiser than some. Yet: And you Mrs. Jacinta, that looked As
harmless as a Devil of two Years old; and As demure, as if Butter would not
melt in your Mouth, were you to be Married in the Morning, and could not
forbear playing at leap frog over Night. Your servant, your servant --


Hold, Sir Barnaby, a word with you, Sir Barnaby.


If this should fall out so luckily now to


With a little good management it may.


We'll all help it forward.


O -- O --


Whose there -- whose there --


Sir Barnaby, Sir Barnaby.


Sir Barnaby, Sir Barnaby.


What Is here, new discoveries.


Sir Barnaby, what makes you fly from us.


What made you Sir Barnaby rise so early, and leave us in Bed by our selves?


Rare Whores -- strike that nail home.


Whores -- Jades -- Carrions --


In my Conscience, Sir Barnaby has picked up your two Mistresses.


Gentlemen, You beat the bush, and he caught the birds.


Ladies, you see old Love cannot be soon forgot.


Queans -- Gypses -- Baggages --


Sir Barnaby, Madam, -- had not disowned us last night, but that it was upon
his Marriage, and before you


Ye Harlots -- ye -- Strumpets -- I Will have you whipped and flead.


O that is too much Sir Barnaby, -- you have given 'em Correction already.


What, Sir Barnaby, in Bed with two at once -- Higledy Pigledy.


No better, -- nor no worse --


Was this his rantum scantum.


To be Married in the Morning -- Sir Barnaby and play at leap frog over night.


Ha, ha, ha.


Rest you merry, Let them laugh that win. Hey Chamberlain, Chamberlain -- Dash,
call to the Hostler, bid him saddle my Horse, and let the Boot-catcher bring up
my Boots, I Will begone at peep of Day


Yes, and please your Worship.


Hold Sir Barnaby, be not in such have.


Let him go -- let him go.


No, that must not be -- his going may spoil a good Dinner, at least, I Will
persuade him not to go till he has Dined

Well, you luscious Jades you -- I Will remember your Christmas boxes for saving
my credit so handsomely -- get you down into the Larder, I Will give you a rare
Breakfast.


We'll meet you there -- your Servant Ladies.


Your Servant Gentlemen


Look you Madam -- who would not Love such honest wenches -- how ready they
were to do a Man a good turn


Servant! I Will allow they have a great deal of good nature -- for they are for
doing every Man's turn as well as yours


That Is Malice, and ill nature in you --


I Will grant you any thing at this time, because we'll not loose the opportunity
of doing my Cousen a piece of service


We'll find out Lovell -- tell him the whole business, and concert with him,
how matters shall be managed


In the mean time, we'll retire into our Chamber.


Let that be the place of Rendezvouse.


Come Captain.


THen you heard nothing of all these fine doings last Night*


No, Sir.


Nor you did not hear the Pistol go off?


No.


Lady, you slept like a Dormouse, and I wonder that you being so sound a
sleeper -- your Daughter should be so wakeful to leave her Bed at midnight


But Sir Barnaby, are you not mistaken in what you told me.


Look you Sir, Truth may be blamed, but never shamed. I could give you farther
proof if occasion served. But Truth is not to spoken at all times


Yet it concerns you to speak, and to prove what you speak, this is no jesting
matter


Well than, Over shoes, over boots. And In for a Penny, in for a Pound. Whee
-- ho -- Toby.


Here, Sir.


I Will resign my Office, I Will resign my Office.


What now!


I Will resign my Office, if I been't better obeyed.


What, are you frantic?


'Twould make me frantic, and stark mad, were not I a Justice of Peace, and
Coram too, which this rebellious Cook cares not a straw for; there are a dozen
of Woodcocks


Pray put your self into the number, and make 'em a Baker's dozen.


I am contented, so they may be dressed to my mind; he has found out a new device
for sauce, and will not dress them with Toasts and Butter. I had rather loose my
Commission, than suffer't


Let 'em be dressed as you will, go in and trouble us no farther.


Well, I Will go, Woodcocks without Toasts and Butter, by the Lord Harry, I Will
never suffer't.


Now Toby, speak neither for favor nor affection, But tell truth, and shame
the Devil, what did you tell me you saw last Night


Having occasion to rise in the Night, to go down (and please your Worship,) as
I came in again, I perceived two young brisk Sparks Dance up stairs before me,
they parted in the Gallery, and one of 'em went tap, tap, at Mrs. Jacinta's
door, which presently opened, and in he went. Thought I, this is some guest
that has mistaken his Room -- I crept softly, and peeped in -- whip went of his
Hat -- and whip went off his Coat -- thus half undressed threw himself within
the Curtains, and cried, my Dear -- Dear Jacinta; and there they hugged and
kissed, and hugged -- till the Bed shook like an old barn, in a windy day


Hum!


At length says Mrs. Jacinta (whose voice I knew,) come, come, to Bed my Dear,
and don't get Cold; so I will replied the other, we will so kiss and hug all this
Night, my Dear, Dear, for you are to be Married to Morrow


And -- and what followed?


Then the door was locked on the inside. I sat me down, resolved to watch till
Morning -- but before day light, out they came, and surprising me there, took
me for a Spy, and a listner, and discharged a Pistol at me, just as my Master
opened his door it mist me, down stairs I scattered, they after me -- but I ran
into the Orchard, and hid my self in the Pear Tree


Hang him that has never a shift.


And you both heard and saw a Man in my Daughter's Chamber.


As I told you, upon my Corporal Oath.


But --


Well, never was the like of such a fellow.


Are you interrupting us again!


Mr. Alderman, what do you think?


I think, you will do very well to be gone.


Nay, but pray hear me --


I will hear nothing.


Well then -- I take your silence for consent, I Will even commit this saucy
Cook. I Will sign a Warrant for him forthwith


Let me tell you Mr. Justice you do very ill to trouble us, when we are upon
serious business


Why, Mr. Alderman, there is as lovely a Codds-head, as ever Eyes beheld, and
how do you think this Rogue of a Cook is going to dress it


As he should do your Head, cleave it, and take out the brains.


What Is the matter Mr. Alderman, you are even as Chollerick as the Cook? what
say you Sir Barnaby -- will it do well -- a Cods-head without Shrimps


Sir, We have other Fish to fry at this time. You had as good go from whence
you came, for here you will be but Out of the Drying Pan, into the Fire


Well, I Will try the other bout with the Cook, and if I cannot fadge, I Will
discreetly sit me down and cry for vexation, for my passion must have vent -- a
Cods head without Shrimps, O monstrous


Friend, what manner of Man was this person, you saw in my Daughter's Chamber.


I did not see his Face -- for his back was to the Door all the while -- but a
brisk youngster i'saith


Now I have given you sufficient proof, restore my acquittance, and take back
your Daughter -- Even Reckoning, makes long Friends. And so Merry meet, merry
part


I Will give one Proverb for your two, One tales good, till another is told.
Therefore I Will not close my account with you, till I have spoken with my
Daughter


You have paid me in my own Coin. Reason is Reason, all the World over. For he
that Judges, must hear both parties. But pray dispatch, for I stand upon Thorns


It will be necessary, that you, who are her accusers, should go with me to her.


A guilty Conscience needs no accuser, however we'll go, tho we Shall be as
welcome, as Water into a Ship, for I know she will look at us, As the Devil looks
over Lincoln.


No Shrimps! a Cods-head without Shrimps!


Yes, Sir, a Cods head without Shrimps, is as good as a Justices head, without
Brains


I tell you Cook, you are saucy.


I tell you Mr. Justice, you are Jack in an Office.


I shall lay you by the Heels.


Than, I Jack Sauce, the Cook, will bast your Worship, as I bast my Meat.


To strike a Justice of Peace, is Petty Treason, Edwardi quinto. But for
spoiling of Dinner, I Would send you away presently, and commit you without Bail or
Mainprize


For all that -- keep out of the Kitchen, which is my Dominion, or I will
scall'd you without measure, and without mercy. Why sure Mr. Justice, I can
dress Dinner without you, hau --


The Rogues as Chollerick as a rosting Lobster -- I must give him good words,
or All the fat will be in the Fire. Well honest Jack Sauce, do as thou will --
why should old Friends fall out -- give me thy hand


I Love your Worship with all my Heart.


Do thou? prithee than let there be Shrimps to the Cods head -- dear Sauce,
honest dear Sauce


Why* so there is Sir --


Is there -- what made you and I quarrel then?


You would not have patience till it came to the Table.


Thou said true -- come prithee let us go see how matters are in the Kitchen.


Kitchen me no Kitchen, if you can be quiet, things will be done well enough.


Give me thy hand once more -- thou art an honest Fellow, -- thou say there
shall be Shrimps than, ha, shall there


If you speak Sir, one word more --


I -- a -- done -- I Will bring thee a bottle of Sack into the Kitchen.


And I Will relish't with a plate of pickled Mushrooms.


Honest Cook! honest Jack Sauce, no Shrimps! in my Conscience, 'twould have
broke my Heart.


So far all goes well, my Brother resolves to quit the Field -- but now to work
the Alderman -- that he may not suspect a Contrivance, that is the difficulty --
let me see --


Mr. Lovell! yes, it is he -- soho -- whose within?


Are you here Captain!


That Is a Lovers question right -- even let your


Your friend gave you fair warning not to fall in love.


There Is the Devil on it, I know not how it comes about -- well, believe me, tho
Women look like Angels -- there is witchcraft about 'em; for if a Woman does but
fetch the long heave, with lifting up her Head, and bending in her Back, two
little -- round -- white -- plump -- pouting Devils pop up before, which put
such a glowing heat into my veins, that my blood in a moment grows too hot for
it is Channels* and I could o'errun a score of 'em


You are transported at the very thoughts of Women.


I am now in one of my fits -- that I had but half a dozen Ladies in my great
Cabin! how I Would rummage them together, I Would make 'em smoke again


If you are so hot, take a walk in the open Air to cool you.


That will not do -- if we were going to engage, perhaps the loss of a Leg or an
Arm, might abate my Fever


Your distemper is so rooted in you, that you must loose a Leg or an Arm for
every handsome Woman you see, or you will not be thoroughly cured


Say you so, than I Will endure it still, and try what time and chance will do.


But how go squares 'twixt you and your Mistress?


Well remembered, she sent me this Letter even now by her Maid; I wanted
somebody to read it to me


Cannot you Read?


No, I am a Sea-Captain, the Sea breeds Soldiers, but not Scholars: it is out
of my Element


You shall hear it then.

MY Roaring Boy, I can Love no longer at your fierce rate, my Heart is bound
under another Convoy, give Chase to a fresh Mistress; I am sailing after a new
Rigged Gallant, and now bid you defiance. So a boon Voyage to you Captain, and
farewell

Arabella.


What, turned Renegate?


Short warning this!


See, she is not out of my Hemisphere. I Will give her Chase.


They tack about to us.


How dejected my Lover looks now I have taken away his Commission.


Captain, what think you of love?


As of folly.


Is It not a fine pastime?


Yes for Fools.


What think you of Women?


As of light Sailors.


Arab. Ha, ha, ha.


That shot Captain, hit 'twixt wind and water.


Or, as of Ships that are crank for want of Ballast, tossed about with every
wave, and cannot be steered in any true course


Hill. Ha, ha, ha.


Do you play with my Anger; Am I so tame to be laughed at? sure I have seemed
more terrible, when with this Sword, I have lop'd off Limbs, strow'd Decks with
Carcases, turned Fleets to floating Hospitals, sent Navies to their Ports to
cut down Masts, and hew the Timber of their scattered Vessels into wooden Legs
and Crutches, to under-prop the Cripples they brought home. Love, have thou
disarmed my looks of Manhood? -- phew -- with that gale begone


Ha, ha, ha.


Captain, Love is still in Port, he went not out with that strong puff.


No, Love has not yet weighed Anchor.


Captain -- you have a qualm yet in your Stomach, you are either Sea-sick, or
Lovesick still


But Captain -- if you have really done with Love and Women -- Let us know your
thoughts of both in good earnest, what is Love


A Sea, a dangerous Sea, where Wind and Tide are still contrary: Men are the
Barks that venture out, whose ruins still its Waves conspire


And what are Women in this Ocean?


Pirates, that rob us of our hearts, Laplanders that give us a fair wind to
leave safe Harbors, and when we are out at Sea, make it swell to a Tempest to
drown us. I have out-rid the Storm, thanks to my lusty Vessel, and now being
gotten safe in Harbor, can look back and say -- Yonder I had like to have been
wrecked


Well said, now you have given them a whole Broadside.


For all that, I see he is but a fresh water Lover yet: Now you think your self
past danger, you are in greatest peril to be Cast away -- what think you if
that Letter which raised this Tempest, was but a Plot to -- see how my Lover
could bear the loss of his Mistress


What wind do you call this? -- By what Point of the Compass will you steer now?


I think I had best make what haste I can to come up with stern of her.


That it was so, here is my hand on it.


It Is very true, this Plot was but to try your humor.


Why then, we'll put out to Sea once again, and my heart shall run the risque
with yours in all Adventures


Captain, I strike sail to you.
You now with Triumph in Love's Ocean steer,
Calm is the Sea, and from all Pirates clear.

The Conference is broke up, here comes Careless and my Brother: Get you two in
-- Now Captain, for our management


Let him come.


You see your Daughter is so confounded at one Evidence, she scarcely had
confidence to deny't; for a guilty Conscience needs no Accuser


I am sorry you had the trouble to come so far for so little purpose; but
excuse me -- I cannot forbear grieving at a Child's misfortune


Children are certain Cares, but uncertain Comforts. Now, Sir, remember that
Giff Gaff is an honest man; You have your Daughter, give me my Acquittance. So
the man has his Mare again and no hurt done


It Is Locked up in my Chamber, but I Will fetch it you: To commit such
extravagance the very Night before her marriage, what madness possessed her


Sir Barnaby, you intend then to begone.


As soon as I can get my Boots on.


Without marrying Mrs. Jacinta.


She has spun a fine thread; even let her brew as she baked.


Who do you think shall marry her, now you have defamed her?


He that was with her last Night, if he please: Evening Orts are good Morning
fother: but for my part, I am not so hungry to lick another man's dish


But Sir Barnaby, you are the man must make her reparation, you have traduced
me and defamed her -- the scandal brings an aspersion on the whole Family that
I seek to contract alliance with, for her Cozen Hilaria is the person I pretend
marriage to; for all offenses therefore against her -- her Family and my self
-- from you I challenge satisfaction


What do you mean by satisfaction?


Here before your Brother and the Captain, I require that you first deny all
you have said against the Lady's Honor. Secondly, that you make it your
request to marry her


Bate me an Ace of that, quoth Bolton.


You must, Sir.


I have brought an old House upon my head; Eat my words and marry her. Two
words to that bargain


No, Sir, the last I deny; tho I believe nothing in prejudice of Jacinta's
Honor, how ever unhappy circumstances make him think so, yet till he is
convinced to the contrary, he cannot in Honor, nor must not Marry her


Must not! -- he must, and shall or --


Must is for the King.


I say must -- unless I spring a Leak, and sink forty Fathom deep under the
Earth


Who so bold, as a blind Byard.


Captain, forbear.


I have brought my Hogs to a fine Market, this will be The Devil upon Dun.


I am glad you are so far a favourer of our cause, to believe Jacinta innocent.


I do.


But since her Honor and the Family's cannot be held without this Marriage; I
press him to that point, tho at the same time, I direct my Sword against the
Brother of my Friend, and even against my Friends own breast, for I am sure the
Captain will not stand idle


Tho I am not so skilled in Love, I hope I shall do my part at this sport.


This mends like sower Ale in Summer.


I think we are all ready.


Draw Brother.


Hum -- humh --


Come let us not loose time.


Draw Brother, draw.


Umh, What Is worse than ill luck.


What Is the matter.


My Sword with riding, is grown rusty in the Scabbard.


Let me see it Sir Barnaby -- I Will warrant you.


Trust my Sword in an Enemies hand! Whose's the fool than.


Cry you mercy.


Ay, Cry you mercy, killed the Cat. -- umh humh.


Let me see it -- Gentlemen with your patience, I Will speak two words aside to my
Brother


Dispatch, dispatch -- the winds fair.


What a pox -- No such have, to hang true Folk


Let us not engage in an ill cause, if we can help it.


I am content to let it alone, tell 'em It Is good to have Wit i^ ones Anger.


But you must repair the Ladies Honor.


But I Will not take a Lease of her for life, to be bound to repairs, when all
the damage has been done by the Tenant at will


Upon my Life and Conscience, I think her very innocent and virtuous* Be not
abused by fond suspicions


One may see light at a little hole.


I am confident -- she will make a good Wife.


A Vessel will smell of the first Liquor. Once a Whore, and ever a Whore.


I have done -- we must even fight it out,


It Is a little Cold this morning methinks.


Cold!


May come it early, come it late, it will make the Cow to quake.


Since you are afraid, rather than your Honor shall be exposed -- I Will make
one Proposal -- and let you see, I persuade you to nothing, that I would not do
my self -- Gentlemen, my Brother cannot Marry the Lady, because his Opinion it
not reconciled to her Honor; but I have other thoughts of the fair Jacinta,
and believe all in her prejudice to be mistakes; therefore if she will accept me
for a Husband; I am ready to do her Justice


I confess you being both of a Family, and Sir Barnaby's Brother, your Marriage
gives sufficient Satisfaction


Ay, Any Tooth good Barber, as the case stands with her.


But your Estate is not half Sir Barnaby's.


There Is a spoak put into the Wheel again.


The whole comes to me, if he die without Issue.


There, He has hit the right nail on the head.


He may Marry, and have Children.


That Puts his Nose out of joint again.


Yet I Will undertake, let but Sir Barnaby, add to your Six Hundred a Year, four
more out of his Estate, during life. And Mr. Alderman shall accept the Change


Come Gentlemen, then let us decide the matter thus: I know my Brother will not be
forced to any thing


No, All things for Love, nothing by force.


What say you Sir Barnaby?


I say Sir, I will not be forced by any body -- nor to any thing -- I Will sooner
loose a thousand Lives


Well said, old boy; come bowze it away.


Come then, Sir, you and I --


Nay, Sir, be as angry as you will -- I Will speak what I have to say first, and
I tell it you to your Teeth, I will not be forced, and yet out of Love and
natural affection, to my Brother -- and because he likes the Gentlewoman, his
fancy shall not be balked. Therefore I will give four Hundred a Year upon that
Condition, whether any here will or nill, and let me see who will say me nay. I
can be as chuff as any of you


I beg your pardon, Sir Barnaby; then friendly we embrace, and here let all
resentments vanish


What then, do we strike our Flag --


Dear Brother, this honorable act surprises me.


No Fighting amongst us, Zou^s, aboard a Ship, we had had as many Bullets ever
this, as here has been words


Captain, You need not be so Crusty, you are not so hard baked.


That Is a Land term, now, that I don't understand.


Uncle -- Uncle, have you any work for a Tinker. The Parson has staid this
hour, and has nothing to do -- must he be gone, or will you have him stay to
say Grace at Dinner


Let him take pains with you, you want Grace.


Right, I am not come to it; Uncle, and you are past it, else you would not be so
easily seduced to believe Sir Barnaby Beelzebub there


Sir Barnaby, here is your Acquittance -- I wish the next Lady you Court, may
have better luck


Mr. Alderman, Sir Barnaby still retains so great a respect for your Daughter,
that if you will accept Mr. Lovell for her Husband, he offers to settle on him,
four Hundred a Year, additional Estate, out of his own, during Life; and you
have a prospect for it all hereafter


Will he!


Yes, -- no offense I hope -- I will -- What Is freer then gift.


Now do I hope my Uncle will refuse the offer -- and give me all his Money when
he Dies, to vex his Daughter


Rather then you shall see a Groat on it, I Will give it to Hospitals, which is
the worst use a Man can put his Money too; for the Poor are always cheated
on it. Mr. Lovell, I have all I can desire, which is to see my Daughter well
disposed off; for your sake I Will add some Hundreds to her Portion -- for my
Heart is now so much lighter then it was


Sir, I Will study to deserve your kindness. And Brother yours --


Lord, Uncle, that you should do all this to spite me.


What you do, do with a Jerk, For I*ll pack up my Aulls and begone.


You Will stay and Dine with us, Sir Barnaby.


Ay, ay, Prayer and Provender, never hinder a Journey. While you order your
matters, Dash. shall draw a short Article for Memorandum


Then I Will go offer my self at Jacinta's Feet, and ask her consent.


Sir, now I have done you a piece of service


Sir, I must acknowledge your friendship; what is it?


To use your Authority with your Neice, and keep her up; for I can be no where,
either about my business, or taking my recreation, but she presently comes and
disturbs me, she was the occasion of all last Nights bustle


Nay if there is any mischief toward, she is at the end on it I warrant you


Ay, but hold Sir, I was at the beginning of that, as you will hear hereafter.


You see how it is Sir -- If you don't take some speedy course with her, I must
be forced to leave this Town, to avoid her Company


Pray take her along with you, and you will free me of a great trouble, for she
has been my vexation some Years


It Is true, that Gentleman and I have been a little troublesome to one another;
you know he came to solicit (...) in the way of Matrimony, which I don't much
approve of; for it makes Folk's fall out. The first Day of Marriage is the last
Day of Love. (...) liked him well enough for a Gallant, and if he would have
accepted of me for a Mistress, or so; we might have fadg'd a while, but he had
a foolish scruple of Conscience, nothing would serve him but Marriage, and so
away came I, this is all Uncle


I shall never learn to know at Land, whether they are in earnest, either in
talking or fighting


If you will have my Opinion in the case, you were cut out, one for the other;
and it is pity two Houses should part you. Therefore if she will agree to your
desire, or you conform to here is, it is all one to me, you have my consent to
either. All I ask is, that you will make an end quickly, that I may be clear of
her Company


Then, Sir, you may either go to London, or stay in the Country, if you please,
without danger of being troubled with me; for I absolutely declare against
Marriage; and if nothing else will serve your turn, you may go when you will,
where you will, and do what you please; I Will have nothing to say to such an
unreasonable Man as you are


To convince you Mr. Alderman, that what she says is not true, but that on the
contrary, I am for having her for a Mistress, and she is for being my Wife: Mr.
Lovell, and the Captain, and all that know me, can witness, I have continually
railed against Marrying


Well, I Will leave you to decide the matter betwixt your selves.


Yes, yes, I have heard you forswear Marrying, and drinking too* yet I catch
you dabling in the Punch bowl next day


Now Lady, if you are not for what I proposed, you may even live a Maid. and
Die a Fool, or live a Fool, and Die a Maid; your Epitaph shall be the same


I except against your Sex for Witnesses, as byast. But rather then such a
lyiny Man as you shall have it, my Maidenhead and I will Live and Die together,
be buried both in a Grave, that you may be chief Mourner at my Funeral. So
farewell you Matrimonial Fop


Pray --


No, there is a Wedding going forward within, and I would not loose the
diversion of that silly sight, to hear all you can say.


Come Captain, we'll go see how scurvily it looks in others, that it may be a
warning for us, to avoid it too. But this I Will say

If for a Wife my liberty I loose,
This is the Girl must catch me in the noose.

Send away Dinner -- send away Dinner, there a pox upon them all for loytering
Rogues, why don't you send Dinner away, I must even sit me down, for I am
almost spent with running and bawling after one and another


Lord, Sir, you have no patience, here is a noise, as if the great Bell rung out
for the Towns being on Fire, and your Tongue was the Clapper


It must Ring out, when my Belly Rings Noon; the baked Meats run out, the
Pottages boil over, and the Roast'd will be dried to Powder


Who can help it -- Sir Barnaby himself gave order for Dinner to be ready by
Eleven of the Clock, the Clock has made all have possible. They within are at
better for worse -- the words are not quite out of their Mouths yet: why, your
Worship is a Man of no moderation


Well, well, they have done by this time, -- good host, see it be sent to
Table, my Spirits are almost spent


It shall, Sir, it shall.


Bid my Clark be ready to attend me.


Yes, Sir.


Oh, Mr. Dash. -- has the Parson done the jobb.


Yes, Sir.


What a sudden change of affairs is here, this good Dinner was provided for Sir
Barnaby's Wedding Dinner -- and is now served up for Mr. Lovell's Bride, and
all falls to his share


Much good do him with her, that has her; I am glad Sir Barnaby mist her.


But what do I prating here, when Dinners going up.


Gemminy Sir, how you are garnished out, as if you were to be served up for a
standing Dish -- more for ornament, than use -- let me help you off with your
Cloak. Some body has pined a dish clout to your back


Whose Roguery was this, the Cooks or the Boys; I Will have 'em all to the
whipping post, for abusing a public Magistrate


Look you Sir, they have pined a dish clout to your back, and the Cape is stuck
with staring Feathers -- like a French hen


Help me -- they will have dined else before I come.


Sir. Mr. Alderman sent me to acquaint you, that a Lord, and a Coach full of
Ladies -- of his acquaintance, Just now are come into bait, whom he could not
but invite to dine with him -- therefore makes bold with you as his special
good friend, the Table being but little to have a a Cloth laid in another Room


How, not dine within, after all my care!


Sir, he desires you to see Dinner sent up in good order, and me to attend at
Table. Your Worship may for once dispense with your Magistracy, and sit with me
and the waiting Gentlewoman; I don't like Dineing amongst great Gentry, it is
not mannerly to fill one's belly before 'em


Well, there shall not a Dish escape me -- and now I think on it, I can there
take my own time; and gorge at leisure


So Sir, you may now put on your Cloak -- only take a view of your Hat, that
Cock's Tail in it makes you look like a City Train-band Captain


Would I knew whose Roguery it was.


Look you Sir, here is the first Dish come from the Table already.


Prithee go and call my Clerk to me.


To the Kitchen, Sir.


No, no, set it down here -- So --


The Dogs will come to it there.


Go Knave, go, what serve I for?


Indeed, Sir, they will.


No, no.


A Greyhound, as I came a long, chopped a great Mary-bone out of my Dish, and
ran away with it


Send him to me then: I Will lay the Dog by the heels.


Come Tom.


Let me see; what is here -- O -- the Toasts and Marybones: Marrow's a delicate
food; the very Quintescence of the Ox -- it Oils the Chops rarely -- and makes
Dinner go glibly down


You Sir, come here -- John, set your Dish down too -- we'll not trust any
thing into the Kitchen till we have Dined, the Rogues there will be Liquorish
and light Fingered


Your Worship speaks discreetly.


I know the tricks of Servants -- John, where is the Cloak-Bag?


Just here Sir.


Let me see -- that is a Pottage -- this a Dish of Scotch Collops -- this a
Frigacy of Chickens -- well relished on my word; this fellow, Sauce, were an
excellent Cook was he not so cross and choleric. Hold the Bag, John, is there
a clean Napkin in it


Yes Sir.


'Twill stand us in use now: Let me see, suppose we put in two or three
Marybones -- Ay, they are full -- remove the Dishes into the next Room there,
and as I send the rest into you, put in some of the best of every thing, but
not so as to unfurnish quite the Dishes


Sir, here is the Venison Pasty scarce touched.


Let me see it -- O rare -- carry't in there. England -- Mr. Dash!


Yes Sir.


John, John, put in a good deal of the Pasty, cut off a lusty corner; take the
fattest of the Venison; and do you hear me, a swinging deal of Pudding Crust.


Sir, must we set these down here too?


Ay, ay, John, John, take in these things here -- Ha! are you at your
Legerdemain? -- Stop Thief, stop Thief


A Pox of your Clutches.


Hey, another Felon -- Sirrah, Sirrah, come here -- Come here Sirrah*


O murder! murder!


Sirrah let go, it is Felony, thou wilt be hanged else: Call in the servants, make
fresh pursuit -- send Hue and Cry after the Rogue


What Is the matter Sir?


O that Villainous Boy has murdered me, he is run away with a Pheasant. John, and
this Leg is all that is left of the Lobster. O never will my Belly forgive my
hands, that could not hold it. -- Here, put this Leg of the Lobster into the
Cloak-Bag -- bring it forth, and let me see how thou have stored it. -- Oh
these unlucky Bastards, I am almost swelter'd --


Some of the Pasty.


Ay, well -- but what have thou done here?


Yes Sir -- there is a good deal of it in --


Oh Rogue! Villain! put Pottage into my Cloak-bag!


It Is very good, 'twill do no hurt I warrant you.


O Nonsensical Ass -- thou have spoiled all: O what do I suffer, the Lobster
broken, the Pheasant gone; how many afflictions befall me in one day. Here, lead
me into the next Room; I Will sit me down and sigh till my heart breaks, for
surely I can never survive all this


Pray, Sir, have patience.


No, no, my stomach's gone with vexing. I am a dead man, I shall never eat
again. -- There, there -- bring in the Cloak-bag, and my Cloak with it. Oh. --


I am glad our Guests are gone. -- Now, Mr. Lovell, I wish you much joy with my
Daughter -- may you live happy together


So do I, but marry in haste and repent at leisure.


The marriage seldom knows repentance where both parties are pleased.


All Is well that ends well; I say, the proof of the Pudding is in the Eating.
So rest you merry


Sir Barnaby, two words ere you go; it is not convenient you should depart under
the scandal of a Licentious Bastard-getter, therefore that you may go with as
clear a reputation as you came, I declare these two here were set on by some
that I know, to bring you in disrepute with Mr. Alderman and his Daughter. --
Farther they confess, that the old Justice shifted them out of his Room into
yours this morning by accident. So you are cleared from two scandals, and three
Children, at once


All this we own.


Well said: When the Frier's beaten then comes Jack.


Look you Sir, these are the Clothes you found in my Cozens Chamber, which we
borrowed of those two young Youths that came down with us yesterday in the
other Stage-Coach, and are going into France with their Governor to Travel;
these we put on out of a frolic. I undressed in her Chamber; and I was that
little Fornicator that so kissed and caressed her in her bed. This Uncle, I
hope, will ease your mind, and reconcile Sir Barnaby to the Bride's reputation


T^ttle Tattle, give the Go^se more Hay.


Nay, Sir, the Captain and I are Witnesses to this matter.


Ask my fellow if I am a Thief.


It Is like enough, my Niece is seldom without an unlucky frolic.


Then she is like Goodyears Pig, always doing mischief.


We -- we -- we --


Ha, ha, ha --


I shall meet some of you either at Hedge or Style -- and so let them laugh
that win --


Ha, ha, ha.


Sir Barnaby, Sir Barnaby, remember Waltoms Calfe -- Farewell Frost --


I Will see him mounted for his last kindness.


I must bid him farewell too.


I am glad he missed my Daughter; I like neither his person nor humor. Come,
now I Will lead you the way in -- we'll have the Music and be merry


Hold, hold, Uncle; you are for rising from Table before Dinner's done --
here is another Course yet to come up: The Parson must say Grace once more


Lead on, Sir; pray lead on -- here is a Plot upon me.


Come, come, Careless, never halt before a Cripple.


O Madam, you are a dangerous Person, I dare not trust my self with you alone.


Niece, what say you to me?


It comes just now in my mind that I have lost my Bedfellow, and now my Cozen
is married I know not what to do, for I vow I dare not lie alone


O no, it is dangerous; for after seeing marriages, and a new married Couple put
to Bed together, as strange dreams and fancies will be apt to run in your mind,
as after seeing Executions and dead People; and who knows what a taking you may
be in in the Night, and what strange fits you may have


O Sir, do you begin to come about; would you beat off others that you may be
my Bedfellow your self? I perceive now that you are for having a Wife


I for a Wife?


Madam, you come just in the nick of time, to see a poor distressed Damesel
throw her self away -- Well Sir, give me your hand, rather than lie alone to
Night I Will do any thing


I knew 'twou'd come to this.


I will be you Wife; and since I cant't have a Gallant before marriage, I Will do
like other Wives, and have one after. And now I think on it too, a Husband's
very necessary to keep off a scandal; and besides, what Children the Gallant
gets, the Husband must keep


You are like to have a hopeful Wife.


I can be even with her there. -- Look you Madam, you can bring me none to keep
but what are my own; and if you expect I should be a Father to all your
Children, I expect you should be a Nurse to all mine, and I may have 'em
brought home to me on all sides; for I intent to be a great getter, and the
Father of many. Is it a bargain


It is: Here, lewd Fellow, here is my hand on it, Heaven send thee good luck, for
I shall be a plague to thee as long as I live


This is fair play on both sides.


This it is for folks to meet that understand themselves. Captain, what think
you of this


He Is in a deep Contemplation of Love too.


Yes, and this is the very thing I love.


Let not such idle thoughts trouble your head, I am almost weary on it my self.


Say you so?


Yes, you and I will be friends for all that, such a trifle as love shall break
no squares. So Captain, tack about to the next


But by your leave, it is more honorable to stand into rights than to make a
tack, and say and sing the Devil's head off. I will judge of Love by the Rules
of Honor; therefore sink or swim, I Will bear up close with you


Well said old Buccanier.


I like a man of resolution well; then here is my hand, my trusty Tarpaulin, you
shall find me no flincher neither. And now Captain, we are sailing out of the
Haven of Love into the Tempestuous Sea of Matrimony


So, at last I have gotten the Weather-gage of her, and now I Will lay her thwart
the Harser and Board her to rights


Now Uncle, pray Con over our Agreement, for you are to be Summoned for a
Witness upon occasion


It is like to be a fine marriage.


Yes, if it go on as you begun.


You shall see our marriage (which you think clapped up out of a frolic) go on
more cheerfully than yours made out of stark Love and desperate Affection; we,
like two Birds, though we Roost together at Night, will have our freedom all day,
and fly chirping about, whilst you, like two Domestic Animals, coupled too
close together, shall still be sharling and biting one at another


And we have the trouble every now and then to part you. Mark the end on it.


Mrs. Breeder and Mrs. Dazie, your good service shall be rewarded; let none of
your Function think they have lost me because I am married, I am entered into
matrimony but not into bondage


He has, as it were, but one Mistress the more. -- Lead away Uncle.

Whilst other Wives and Husbands Scold and Rant,
We two will live like Mistress and Gallant.

FRom Elbow Chair in the Pantry I am come,
To see what you are doing here; make room.
So heartily I slept after my Labor,
My Nose did louder Music make than Pipe and Tabor.
My Dreams presented me a Bill of Fare,
Of sumptuous Meat and Dainties that were rare:
I waked with joy, and to my comfort find,
Three Couple here in Bonds of Wedlock joined.
Three days we'll Feast, a day for every Pair,
And each days Management shall be my care:
We'll have our swinge of Mirth, let nothing cross it,
For every Bride I Will provide a good Sack-Posset,
With grated Naples-Bisket made, and yolks
Of new-laid Eggs, Salacious Food for married Folks:
It shall be rich with Ambergreese and Pounded Pearls,
Which shall provoke a Race of lusty Boys and Girls:
A Bridal Cake for each one too to Munch on,
And every Guest shall have a lusty Lunchon.
All that are here for Guests I do invite;
We'l^ treat the first, the second, and third Night;
With all the choicest Dainties I will feed ye:
