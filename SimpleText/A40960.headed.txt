AS stubborn Atheists, who disdained to pray,
Repent, tho late, upon their dying day,
So in their pangs, most Author's racked with fears,
Implore your mercy in our suppliant prayers.
But our new Author has no Cause maintained,
Let him not lose what he has never gained.
Love and a Bottle are his peaceful arms?
Ladies, and Gallants, have not these some Charms.
For Love, all mankind to the Fair must sue,
And Sirs, the Bottle, he presents to you.
Health to the Play, (drinks.) even let it fairly pass,
Sure none sit here that will refuse their glass.
Othere's a damning Soldier -- let me think --
He looks as he were sworn -- to What! -- to drink. (drinks.
Come on then; foot to foot be boldly set,
And our young Author's new Commission wet.
He and his Bottle here attend their doom,
From you the Poets Hellicon must come;
If he has any foes, to make amends,
He gives his service (drinks) sure you now are friends.
No Critic here will he provoke to fight,
The day be theirs, he only begs his Night;
Pray pledge him now, secured from all abuse,
Then name the health you love, let none refuse,
But each man's Mistress be the Poet's Muse.


THUS far our Arms have with Success been Crowned. -- Heroically spoken, faith,
of a fellow that has not one farthing in his Pocket. If I have one Penny to buy
a Halter withal in my present necessity, may I be hanged; tho I Am reduced to a
fair way of obtaining one methodically very soon, if Robbery or Theft will
purchase the Gallows. But hold -- Cannot I rob honorably, by turning Soldier


One farthing to the poor old Soldier, for the Lord's sake.


Ha! -- a glimpse of Damnation just as a Man is entering into sin, is no great
policy of the Devil. -- But how long did you bear Arms, friend


Five years, an't please you Sir.


And how long has that honorable Crutch born you?


Fifteen, Sir.


Very pretty! Five year a Soldier, and Fifteen a Beggar! -- This is Hell right!
an age of Damnation for a momentary offense. Thy condition fellow, is
preferable to mine; the merciful Bullet, more kind than thy ungrateful Country,
has given thee a Debenter in thy broken Leg, from which thou can draw a more
plentiful maintenance than I from all my Limbs in perfection. Prithee friend,
why would thou beg of me? Do think I Am rich


No, Sir, and therefore I believe you charitable. Your warm fellows are so far
above the sense of our Misery, that they cannot pity us; and I have always
found it, by sad experience, as needless to beg of a rich Man as a Clergyman.
Our greatest Benefactors, the brave Officers are all disbanded, and must now
turn Beggars like my self; and so, Times are very hard, Sir


What, are the Soldiers more charitable than the Clergy.


Ay, Sir, A Captain will say Dam'me, and give me Sixpence; and a Parson shall
whine out God bless me, and give me not a farthing: Now I think the Officers
Blessing much the best


Are the Beau's never compassionate?


The great full Wigs they wear, stop their Ears so close, that they cannot hear
us; and if they should, they never have any farthings about'em


Then I am a Beau, friend; therefore pray leave me. Begging from a generous
Soul that has not to bestow, is more tormenting than Robbery to a Miser in his
abundance. Prithee friend, be thou charitable for once; I beg only the favor
which rich friends bestow, a little Advice. I am as poor as thou art, and am
designing to turn Soldier


No, no, Sir. See what an honorable Post I am forced to stand to, My Rags are
scarecrows sufficient to frighten any one from the Field; rather turn bird of
prey at home


Grammercy, old Devil. I find Hell has its Pimps of the poorer sort, as well as
of the wealthy. I fancy, friend, thou have got a Cloven-foot instead of a
broken Leg. It Is a hard Case, that a Man must never expect to go nearer Heaven
than some steps of a Ladder. But it is unavoidable: I have my wants to lead, and
the Devil to drive; and if I cannot meet my friend Lovewell, (which I think
impossible, being so great a stranger in Town) Fortune thou have done thy
worst; I proclaim open War against thee

I Will stab thy next rich Darling that I see;
And killing him, be thus revenged on thee.


Oh these Summer mornings are so delicately fine, Pindress, it does me good to
be abroad


Ay, Madam, these Summer mornings are as pleasant to young folks, as the Winter
nights to married people, or as your morning of Beauty to Mr. Lovewell


I Am violently afraid the Evening of my Beauty will fall to his share very
soon; for I Am inclinable to marry him. I shall soon lie under an Eclipse,
Pindress


Then it must be full Moon with your Ladyship. But why would you choose to
marry in Summer, Madam


I know no cause, but that people are aptest to run mad in hot weather, unless
you take a Woman's reason


What Is that, Madam?


Why, I am weary of lying alone.


Oh dear Madam! lying alone is very dangerous; it is apt to breed strange Dreams.


I had the oddest Dream last night of my Courtier that is to be, 'Squire
Mockmode. He appeared crowded about with a Dancing Master, Pushing-Master,
Musick-Master, and all the throng of Beaumakers; and methought he mimick'd
Foppery so awkwardly, that his imitation was downright burlesquing it. I burst
out a laughing so heartily, that I wakened my self


But Dreams go by contraries, Madam. Have not you seen him yet.


No; but my Unkles Letter gives account that he is newly come to Town from the
University, where his Education could reach no farther than to guzzle fat Ale,
smoke Tobaco, and chop Logic. -- Faugh -- it makes me Sick


But he is very rich, Madam; his Concerns join to yours in the Country.


Ay, but his Concerns shall never join to mine in the City: For since I have
the disposal of my own Fortune, Lovewell's the Man for my Money


Ay, and for my Money; for I Have have had above twenty Pieces from him since his
Courtship began. He Is the prettiest sober Gentleman; I have so strong an
opinion of his modesty, that I Am afraid, Madam, your first Child will be a Fool


Oh God forbid! I hope a Lawyer understands business better than to beget any
thing non compos. -- The Walks fill a pace; the Enemy approaches, we must set
out our false Colors


We Masks are the purest Privateers! Madam, how would you like to Cruise about
a little


Well enough, had we no Enemies but our Fops and Cits: But I dread these
blustering Men of War, the Officers, who after a Broadside of Dam'me's and
Sinkme's, are for boarding all Masks they meet, as lawful Prize


In truth Madam, and the most of 'em are lawful Prize, for they generally have
French Ware under Hatches


Oh hidious! OF my Conscience Girl thou'at quite spoild, An Actres upon the
Stage would blush at such expressions


Ay Madam, and your Ladyship would seem to blush in the Box, when the redness
of your face proceeded from nothing but the constraint of holding your
Laughter. Did you chide me for not putting a stronger Lace in your Stays, when
you had broke one as strong as a Hempen Cord, with containing a violent Tihee
at a smutty Jest in the last Play


Go, go, you are a naughty Girl; thy impertinent Chat has diverted us from our
business. I Am afraid Lovewell has missed us for want of the Sign: -- But whom
have we here? an odd figure! some Gentleman in disguise, I believe


Had he a finer Suit on, I should believe him in disguise; for I fancy his
friends have only known him by that this Twelvemonth


His Mien and Air show him a Gentleman, and his Clothes demonstrate him a Wit.
He may afford us some sport. I have a Female inclination to talk to him


Hold, Madam, he looks as like one of those dangerous Men of War you just now
mentioned as can be; you had best send out your Pinnace before to discover the
Enemy


No, I Will hale him my self.

What, Sir, dreaming?


Yes, Madam.


Of what?


Of the Devil, and now my Dream's out.


What! do you Dream standing?


Yes faith, Lady, very often when my sleep's haunted by such pretty Goblins as
you. You are a sort of Dream I would fain be reading: I Am a very good
interpreter Indeed, Madam


Are you then one of the Wise Men of the East?


No, Madam; but one of the Fools of the West.


Pray what do you mean by that?


An Irishman, Madam, at your Service.


Oh horrible! an Irishman! a mere Wolf-Dog, I protest.


Ben't surpised Child; the Wolf-Dog is as well natured an Annimal as any of
your Country Bull-Dogs, and a much more fawning Creature, let me tell ye


Pray good Caesar, keep off your Paws; no scarping acquaintance, for Heaven's
sake. Tell us some news of your Country; I have heard the strangest Stories, --
that the people wear Horns and Hoofs


Yes, faith, a great many wear Horns: but we had that among other laudable
fashions, from London. I think it came over with your mode of wearing high
Topknots; for ever since, the Men and Wives bear their heads exalted alike.
They were both fashions that took wonderfully


Then you have Ladies among you?


Yes, yes, we have Ladies, and Whores; Colleges, and Playhouses; Churches, and
Taverns; fine Houses, and Bawdy-houses; in short, every thing that you can
boast of, but Fops, Poets, Toads and Adders.


But have you no Beau's at all?


Yes, they come over, like the Woodcoks, once a year.


And have your Ladies no Springes to catch 'em in?


No, Madam; our own Country affords us much better Wild-fowl. But they are
generally stripped of their feathers by the PIayhouse and Taverns; in both
which they pretend to be Critics; and our ignorant Nation imagines a full Wig
as infallible a token of a Wit as the Laurel


Oh Lard! and here it is the certain sign of a Blockhead. But why no Poets in
Ireland, Sir


Faith, Madam, I know not, unless St. Patrick sent them a packing with other
venomous Creatures out of Ireland. Nothing that carries a Sting in its Tongue
can live there. But since I have described my Country, let me know a little of
England, by a sight of your Face


Come you to particulars first. Pray, Sir, unmasque, by telling who you are;
and then I Will unmasque, and show who I am


You must dismiss your attendant then, Madam; for the distinguishing particular
of me is a Secret


Sir, I can keep a Secret as well as my Mistress; and the greater the secrets
are, I love 'em the better


Cannot they be whispered, Sir?


Oh yes, Madam, I can give you a hint, by which you may understand 'em --


Sir, you're Impudent --


Nay, Madam, since you're so good at minding folks, have with you.


Help! help! help!



Villain, unhand the Lady, and defend thy self.


What! Knight-Errants in this Country! Now has the Devil very opportunely sent
me a Throat to cut; Pray Heaven his Pockets be well lined. --

Have at thee -- St. George for England. --

My Friend Lovewell?


My dear Roebuck!

Shall I believe my eyes?


You may believe your ears; It Is I be gad.


Why thy being in London is such a mystery, that I must have the evidence of
more senses than one to confirm me of its truth. -- But pray unfold the Riddle


Why Faith it is a Riddle. You wonder at it before the Explanation, then wonder
more at your self for not guessing it. -- What is the Universal cause of the
continued Evils of mankind


The Universal cause of our continued evil is the Devil sure.


No, it is the Flesh, Ned. -- That very Woman that drove us all out of Paradise,
has sent me a packing out of Ireland


How so?


Only tasting the forbidden Fruit: that was all.


Is simple Fornication become so great a Crime there, as to be punishable by no
less than Banishment


I gad, mine was double Fornication, Ned -- The Jade was so pregnant to bear
Twins; the fruit grew in Clusters; and my unconscionable Father, because I was
a Rogue in Debauching her, would make me a fool by Wedding her: But I would not
marry a Whore, and he would not own a disobedient Son, and so --


But was she a Gentlewoman?


Pshaw! No, she had no Fortune. She wore indeed a Silk Manteau and High-Head;
but these are grown as little signs of Gentility now adays, as that is of
Chastity


But what necessity forced you to leave the Kingdom?


I Will tell you. -- To shun the insulting Authority of an incensed Father, the
dull and often-repeated advice of impertinent Relations, the continual clamours
of a furious Woman, and the shrill bawling of an ill natured Bastard. -- From
all which, Good Lord deliver me


And so you left them to Grand Dada! -- Ha, ha, ha.


Heaven was pleased to lessen my affliction, by taking away the she Brat; but
the the other is, I hope, well, because a brave Boy, whom I christened Edward,
after thee, Lovewell; I made bold to make my man stand for you, and your Sister
sent her Maid to give her name to my Daughter


Now you talk of my Sister, pray how does she?


Dear Lovewell, a very Miracle of Beauty and Goodness. -- -- But I don't like
her


Why?


She Is Virtuous; -- and I think Beauty and Virtue are as ill joined as Lewdness
and Ugliness


But I hope your Arguments could not make her a Proselyte to this Profession.


Faith I endeavored it; but that Plaguey Honor -- Damn it for a whim -- Were
it as honorable for Women to be Whores, as men to be Whore-masters, we should
have Lewdness as great a Mark of Quality among the Ladies, as it is now among
the Lords


What! do you hold no innate Principle of Virtue in Women?


I hold an innate principle of Love in them: Their Passions are as great as
ours, their Reason weaker. We admire them and consequently they must us. And I
tell thee once more, That had Women no safe guard but your innate Principle of
Virtue, honest George Roebuck would have lain with your Sister, Ned, and should
enjoy a Countess before night


But methinks, George, 'twas not fair to tempt my Sister.


Methinks 'twas not fair of thy Sister, Ned, to tempt me. As she was thy
Sister, I had no design upon her: but as she is a pretty Woman, I could scarcely
forbear her, were she my own


But, upon serious reflection, Could not you have lived better at home, by
turning thy Whore into a Wife, than hear by turning other Men's Wives into
Whores? There are Merchants Ladies in London, and you must trade with them, for
ought I see


Ay, but is the Trade open? Is the Manufacture encouraged, old Boy?


Oh, wonderfully! -- a great many poor people live by it. Tho the Husbands are
for engrossing the Trade, the Wives are altogether for encouraging Interlopers.
But I hope you have brought some small Stock to set up with


The greatness of my wants, which would force me to discover 'em, makes me
blush to own 'em. Ned, I had a great Journey from Ireland hither, and would
burden my self with no more than just necessary Charges


Oh, then you have brought Bills?


No, faith. Exchange of Money from Dublin hither is so unreasonable high, that
--


What?


That -- Zoons I have not one farthing. -- Now you understand me?


No faith, I never understand one that comes in forma pauperis; I have not studied
the Law so long for nothing. -- But what prospect can you propose of a supply


I Will tell you. When you appeared, I was just thanking my Stars for sending me
a Throat to eut, and consequently a Purse: But my knowledge of you prevented me
of that way, and therefore I think you're obliged in return to assist me by
some better means. You were once an honest Fellow; but so long study in the
Inns may alter a Man strangely, as you say


No, dear Roebuck, I Am still a friend to thy Virtues, and esteem thy Follies as
Foils only to set them off. I did but rally you; and to convince you, here are
some Pieces, share of what I have about me; Take them as earnest of my farther
supply, you know my Estate sufficient to maintain us both, if you will either
restrain your Extravagancies, or I retrench my Necessaries


Thy profession of kindness is so great, that I could almost suspect it of
design. -- But come, Friend, I am heartily tired with the fatigue of my
Journey, besides a violent Fit of Sickness, which detained me a Month at
Coventry, to the exhausting my Health and Money. Let me only recruit by a
relish of the Town in Love and a Bottle, and then --

Oh Heavens! and Earth!


What Is the matter, Man?


Why! Death and the Devil; or, what is worse, a Woman and a Child. -- -- Oons!
don't you see Mrs. Trudge with my Bastard in her Arms crossing the field
toward us? -- Oh the indefatigable Whore to sollow me all the way to London


Mrs. Trudge! my old acquaintance!


Ay, ay, the very same; your old acquaintance; and for ought I know, you might
have clubb'd about getting the Brats


It Is but reasonable then I should pay share at the Reckoning. I Will help to
provide for her; in the mean time, you had best retire. -- Brush, conduct this
Gentlemen to my Lodgings, and run from thence to Widow Bullfinch's, and provide
a Lodging with her for a Friend of mine. -- Fly, and come back presently. --
Turk to the Field, attended by his Concubines and Children; and I Am afraid
these are but parts of his Retinue. -- But hold -- I shall not be able to sustain
the shock of this Woman's Fury. I Will withdraw till she has discharged her first
Volley, then surprise her

Hush, hush, hush. -- And indeed it was a young Traveller. -- And what would it
say? It says that Daddy is a false Man, a cruel Man, and an ungrateful Man. --
In troth so he is, my dear Child. -- What shall I do with it, poor Creature? --
Hush, hush, hush. -- Was ever poor Woman in such a lamentable condition?
immediately after the pains of one Travel to undergo the fatigues of another?
-- But I Am sure he can never do well; for tho l cannot find him, my curses, and
the misery of this Babe, will certainly reach him


Methinks I should know that voice. --

What! Mrs. Trudge! and in London! whose brave Boy have thou got there?


Oh Lord! Mr. Lovewell! I Am very glad to see you, -- and yet am ashamed to see
you. But indeed he promised to marry me, Lovewell, that he is such a handsome
Man, and has so many ways of insinuating, that the frailty of Woman's Nature
could not resist him


What Is all this? -- A handsome Man? Ways of insinuating? Frailty of Nature? --
I don't understand these ambiguous terms


Ah, Mr. Lovewell! I Am sure you have seen Mr. Roebuck, and I Am sure 'twou'd be
the first thing he would tell you. I refer it to you, Mr. Lovewell, if he is
not an ungrateful man, to deal so barbarously with any Woman that had used him
so civily. I was kiuder to him than I would have been to my own born Brother


Oh then I find kissing goes by favor, Mrs. Trudge.


Faith you're all alike, you men are alike. -- Poor Child! he is as like his own
Dadda, as if he were spit out of his mouth. See, Mr. Lovewell, if he has not
Mr. Roebuck's Nose to a hair; and you know he has a very good Nose; and the
little Pigsnye has Mamma's Mouth. Oh the little Lips:! -- and it is the best
natured little dear -- -- Lovewell, I believe the Child knows you


Ha, ha, ha! Well, I will give it my Blessing.

Come, Madam, I Will first settle you in a Lodging and then find the false Man,
as you call him. --



The false man is found already. -- Was there ever such a lucky discovery? --
My care for his preservation brought me back, and now behold how my kindness is
returned! -- Their Fighting was a downright trick to frighten me from the
place, thereby to afford him opportunity of entertaining his Whore and Brat


Your conjecture, Madam, bears a color; for looking back, I could perceive 'em
talking very familiarly; so that they could not be strangers as their pretended
^uarrel would intimate


It Is all true as he is false. -- What! slighted! despised! my honorable Love
truck'd for a Whore! Oh Villain! Epitome of thy Sex! -- But I Will be revenged.
I Will marry the first man that asks me the Question; nay, though he be a
disbanded Soldier, or a poor Poet, or a senseless Fop; Nay though Impotent I Will
Marry him


Oh Madam! that s to be revenged on your self.


I care not, Fool! I deserve punishment for my Credulity, as much as he for his
Falsehood And you deserve it too, Minx; your persuasions drew me to this
Assignation: I never loved the false man


That Is false, I Am sure.


But you thought to get another piece of Gold. We shall have him giving you
Money on the same score he was so liberal to his Whore just now



So much for Friendship -- now for my Love. -- I have not transgressed much. --
Oh, there she is. -- Oh my Angel


Oh thou Devil! --


Not unless you damn me, Madam.


You're damned already; you're a Man.


You're a Woman, I Will be sworn. -- Hey day! what giddy Female Planet rules now!
By the Lord, these Women are like their Maidenheads, no sooner found than lost.
-- Here, Brush, run after Pindress, and know the occasion of this. --

-- Stay, come back -- Zoons, I Am a fool.


That Is the first wise word you have spoke these two months.


Trouble me with your untimely Jests, Sirrah, and I Will. -- --


Your Pardon, Sir; I Am in downright earnest. -- It Is less Slavery to be
Apprentice to a famous Clap-Surgeon, than to a Lover. He falls out with me,
because he cannot fall in with his Mistress. I can bear it no longer


Sarrah, what are you mumbling?


A short Prayer before I depart, Sir. -- -- I have been these three years your
Servant, but now, Sir, I Am your humble Servant


Hold, you shall not leave me.


Sir, you cannot be my Master.


Why so?


Because you're not your own Master; yet one would think you might, for you
have lost your Mistress. Oons, Sir, let her go, and a fair riddance. Who throws
away a Tester and a Mistress, loses sixpence. That little Pimping Cupid is a
blind Gunner. Had he shot as many Darts as I have carried Billets deux, he
would have laid her kicking with her heels up e're now. In short, Sir, my
Patience is worn to the stumps with attending; my Shoes and Stockings are upon
their last Legs with trudging between you. I have sweat out all my moisture of
my hand with palming your clammy Letters upon her. I have --


Hold, Sir, your trouble is now at an end, for I design to marry her.


And have you courted her these three years for nothing but a Wife?


Do you think, Raskal, I would have taken so much pains to make her a Miss?


No, Sir; the tenth part on it would have done. -- But if you are resolved to
marry, God b'w'ye


What Is the matter now, Sirrah!


Why, the matter will be, that I must then Pimp for her. -- -- Hark ye, Sir,
what have you been doing all this while, but teaching her the way to Cuckold
ye? -- -- Take care, Sir; look before you leap. You have a ticklish point to
manage. -- Can you tell, Sir, what is her quarrel to you now


I cannot imagine. I don't remember that ever I offended her.


That Is it Sir. She resolves to put your easiness to the Test now, that she may
with more security rely upon t^ hereafter. -- Always suspect those Women of
Designs that are for searching into the humors of their Courtiers; for they
certainly intend to try them when they are married


How came thou such an Engineer in Love?


I have sprung some Mines in my time, Sir; and since I have trug'd, so long
about your amorous Messages, I have more Intrigue in the sole of my feet, than
some Blockheades in their whole Body


Sirrah, have you ever discovered any behavior in this Lady, to occasion this
suspicious discourse


Sir, has this Lady ever discovered any behavior of yours to occasion this
suspicious quarrel? I believe the Lady has as much of the innate Principle of
Virtue (as the Gentleman said) as any Woman: But that Baggage her Attendant is
about ravishing her Ladies Page every hour. It Is an old saying, Like Master,
like Man; why not as well, like Mistress, like Maid


Since thou art for trying humors, have with you Madam Lucinda. Besides, so
fair an opportu^ity offers, that Fate seemed to design it. -- Have you left the
Gentleman at my Lodgings


Yes, Sir, and sent a Porter to his Inn to bring his things thither.


That Is right -- Love like other Diseases, must sometimes have a desperate
Cure. The Shool of Venus imposes the strist Diseipline; And awful Cupid is a
chastning God; He whips severely


No, not if we kiss the Rod.



OF my Conscience the fawning Creature loves you.


Ay, the constant effects of debauching a Woman are, that she infallibly loves
the Man for doing the business, and he certainly hates her. -- But what Company
is she like to have at this same Widows, Brush


Oh the best of Company, Sir; a Poet lives there, Sir.


They Are the worst Company, for they are ill natured.


Ay, Sir, but it does no body any harm; for these fellows that get Bread by
their Wits, are always forced to eat their words. They must be good natured,
'spight of their Teeth, Sir. It Is said he pays his Lodging by cracking some
smutty Jests with his Landlady overnight; for she is very well pleased with his
natural parts


What other Lodgers are there?


One newly entr'd, a young Squire, just come from the University.


A. mere Perigatetick I warrant him. -- A very pretty Family. A Heathen
Philosopher, an English Poet, and an Irish Whore. Had the Landlady but a
Highland Piper to join with 'em, she might set up for a Collection of Monsters.
-- Any body within


Yes, you are, my Friend. All my thoughts were employed about you. In short, I
have one request to make, That you would renounce your loose wild Courses, and
lead a sober life, as I do


That I will, if you will grant me a Boon.


You shall have it, be it what it will.


That you would relinquish your precise sober behavior, and live like a
Gentleman as I do


That I cannot grant.


Then we are off; Tho should your Women prove no better than your Wine, my
Debaucheries will fall of themselyss, for want of Temptation


Our Women are worse than our Wine; our Claret has but little of the French
in it, but our Wenches have the Devil and all: They are both adulterated, To
prevent the inconveniences of which, I ll provide you an honorable Mistress


An honorable Mistress! what is that?


A virtuous Lady, whom you must Love and Court; the surest method of reclaiming
you. -- As thus. -- Those superfluous Pieces you throw away in Wine may be laid
out. --


To the Poor?


No, no. In Sweet Powder, Cravats, Garters, Snuff-boxes, Ribbons, Coach-hire,
and Chair-hire. Those idle hours which you mispend with lewd sophisticated
Wenches, must be dedicated --


To the Church?


No, To the innocent and charming Conversation of your virtuous Mistress; by
which means, the two most exorbitant Debaucheries, Drinking and Whoring will be
retrenched


A very fine Retrenchment truly? I must first despise the honest jolly
Conversation at the Tavern, for the foppish, affected, dull, insipid
Entertainment at the Chocolate-house; must quit my freedom with ingenious
Company, to harness my self to Foppery among the fluttering Crowd of Cupid's
Livery-boys. -- The second Article is, That I must resign the Company of lewd
Women for that of my Innocent Mistress; That is, I must change my easy natural
sin of Wenching, to that constrained Debauchery of Lying and Swearing. -- The
many Lies and Oaths that I made to thy Sister, will go nearer to damn me, than
if I had enjoyed her a hundred times over


Oh Roebuck! your Reason will maintain the contrary, when you're in Love.


That is, when I have lost my Reason, Come, come; a Wench a Wench! a soft,
white, easy, consenting Creature! -- Prithee Ned leave Musteness, and show me
the Varities of the Town


A Wench is the least Variety -- Look out -- See what a numerous Train trip
along the street there --


Oh Venus! all these fine stately Creatures!

Fair you well, Ned. --

Prithee let me go: It Is a deed of Charity; I Am quite starved. I Will just take a
snap, and be with you in the twinkling. -- As you're my friend.-I must go


Then we must break for altogether? --

-- He that will leave his friend for a Whore, I reckon a Commoner in
Friendship as in Love


If you saw how ill that serious face becomes a Fellow of your years, you would
never wear it again. Youth is taking in any Masqurade but Gravity


Tho Lewdness suits much worse with your Circumstances, Sir.


Ay these Circumstances. Damn these Circumstances. -- There he has Hamstring'd
me. This Poverty! how it makes a Man sneak! -- Well prithee let us know this
Devilish Virtuous Lady. By the Circumstances of my Body I shall soon be off or
on with her


Know then, for thy utter Condemnation, that she is a Lady of Eighteen,
Beatiful, Witty, and nicely Virtuous


A Lady of Eighteen! Good. -- Beautiful! Better. -- Witty! -- Best of all -- --
Now with these three Qualifications, if she be nicely Virtuous, then I Will
henceforth adore every thing that wears a Petycoat. -- Witty and Virtuous! ha,
ha, ha. Why, it is as inconsistant in Ladies as Gentlemen; And were I to debauch
one for a Wager, her Wit should be my Bawd. -- Come, come; the forbidden Fruit
was plucked from the Tree of Knowledge, Boy


Right. -- But there was a cunninger Devil than you, to tempt. -- I Will assure
you George, your Rhetoric would fail you here; she would worst you at your own
Weapons


Ay, or any Man in England, if she be Eighteen as you say:


Have a care, friend, this Satyr will get you torn in pieces by the Females;
you will fall into Orpheus's fate


Orpheus was a blockhead, and deserved his fate.


Why?


Because he went to Hell for a Wife.


This happens right. --


Ay, but Ned, my Circumstances, my Circumstances. --


Come, you shall not want Money.


Then I dare attempt it. Money is the Sinews of Love, as of War. Gad friend,
thou't the bravest Pimp I ever heard of. -- Well, give me directions to sail
by, the name of my Port, laden my Pockets, and then for the Cape of Good Hope


You need no directions as to the manner of Courtship.


No; I have seen some few Principles, on which my Courtship's founded, which
seldom fail. To let a Lady rely upon my modesty, but to depend my self
altogether upon my Impudence; To use a Mistress like a Deity in public, but
like a Woman in private: To be as cautious then of asking an Impertinent
question, as afterward of telling a story; remembering, that the Tongue is the
only Member that can hurt a Ladies Honor, tho touched in the tender'st part


Oh, but to a Friend, George; you will tell a Friend your success?


No, not to her very self; it must be as private as Devotion. -- No blabbing,
unless a squalawling Brat peeps out to tell Tales. -- But where lies my Course


Brush shall show you the house; the Ladies name is Lucinda; her Father and
Mother dead; she is Heiress to Twelve hundred a year: But above all, observe
this: She has a Page which you must get on your side; It Is a very pretty Boy; I
presented him to the Lady about a fortnight ago; he is your Countryman too; he
brought me a Letter from my Sister, which I have about me. -- Here you may read
it


Ay, it is her hand; I know it well; and I almost bush to see it.

Dear Brother, A Lady of my acquaintance lately dying, begged me, as her last
request, to provide for this Boy, who was her Page. I hope I have obeyed my
Friend's last Command, and obliged a Brother, by sending him to you. Pray
dispose of him as much as you can for his advantage. All friends are will, and
I a

Your affectionate Sister, Leanthe.



All friends are well? Is that all? not a word of poor Roebuck. -- I wonder she
mentioned nothing of my misfortunes to her Brother. But she has forgot me
already. True Woman still. -- Well, I may excuse her, for I Am making all the
haste I can to forget her


Be sure you have an eye upon him, and come to me presently at Widow Bulfinch's
-- (To Brush.) -- Well, George, you will not communicate your success


You may guess what you please. -- I Am as merry after a Mistress as after a
Bottle. -- All Air; brimfull of Joy, like a Bumper of Claret, smiling and
sparkling


Then you will certainly run over.


No, no; nor shall I drink to any body. --


Tal -- dal -- deral -- One -- Two. -- Tal -- dal -- deral -- Coupe -- -- Tal
-- dal -- deral -- Very well -- Tal -- dal -- deral -- Wrong. -- Tal -- dal --
deral Toes out -- Tal -- dal -- deral -- Observe Time: -- Very well indeed,
Sir; you shall dance as well as any Man in England: you have an excellent
disposition in your Limbs, Sir: -- Observe me, Sir

And so forth, Sir.


I Am afraid we shall disturb my Landlady.


Landlady! you must have a care of that; she will never pardon you. -- Landlady!
-- Every Woman, from a Countess to a Kitchen-Wench, is Madam; and every Man,
from a Lord to a Lacquey, Sir


Must I then lose my Title of 'Squire, 'Siquire Mockmode?


By all means, Sir; 'Squire and Fool are the same thing here.


That Is very Comical, faith! -- But is there an Act of Parliament for that, Mr.
Rigadoon? -- Well, since I cannot be a 'Squire, I Will do as well: I have a great
Estate, and want only to be a great Beau, to qualify me either for a Knight or
a Lord. By the Universe, I have a great mind to bind my self 'Prentice to a
Beau. -- Could I but dance well, push well, play upon the Flute, and swear the
most modish Oaths, I would set up for Quality with e're a young Nobleman of 'em
all. -- Pray what are the most fashionable Oaths in Town? Zoons, I take it, is
a very becoming one


Zoons is only used by the disbanded Officers and Bullies: but Zauns is the
Beaux pronuncation


Zauns --


Zauns --


Yes, Sir, we swear as we Dance; smooth, and with a Cadence. -- Zauns! -- It Is
harmonious, and pleases the Ladies, because it is soft. -- Zauns, Madam. -- is
the only Compliment our great Beaux pass on a Lady


But suppose a Lady speaks to me? what must I say?


Nothing, Sir. -- you must take Snush, Grin, and make her an humble Cringe --
Thus


O Lard, Sir, you must never sneeze; it is as unbecoming after Orangere, as
Grace after Meat


I thought People took it to clear the Brain.


The Beaux have no Brains at all, Sir; their Skull is a perfect Snush-box; and
I heard a Physician swear, who opened one of 'em, that the three divisions of
his head were filled with Orangere, Bourgamot, and Plain-Spanish


Zauns I must sneeze --


Of fie, Mr. Mockmode! what a rustical expression that is. -- Bless me! -- you
should upon all such occasions cry, Them me. You would be as nauseous to the
Ladies, as one of the old Patriarks, if you used that obsolete expression


I find that going to the Devil is very modish in this Town -- Pray, Master,
Dancing Master, what Religion may these Beaux be of


A sort of Indians in their Religion, They worship the first thing they see in
the Morning


What Is that Sir?


Their own shadows in the Glass; and some of 'em such hellish Faces, that may
frighten 'em into Devotion


Then they are Indians right, for they worship the Devil.


Then you shall be as great a Beau as any of 'em. But you must be sure to mind
your Dancing


Is not Music very convenient too? -- I can play the Bells, and Maiden Fair
already. Alamire, Bifabemi, Cesolfa, Delasol, Ela, Effaut, Gesolreut. I have
'em all by heart already. But I have been plaguily puzzled about the Etymology
of these Notes; and certainly a Man cannot arrive at any perfection, unless he
understands the derivation of the Terms


O Lard, Sir! That Is easy. Effaut and Gesolreut were two famous German
Musicians, and the rest were Italians


But why are they only Seven?


From a prodigious great Bass-Vial with seven Strings, that played a Jig called
the Music of the Spheres: The seven Planets were nothing but Fiddle-strings


Then your Stars have made you a Dancing Master?


O Lard, Sir! Pythagoras was a Dancing Master; he shows the Creation to be a
Country-Dance, where after some antic Changes, all the parts fell into their
places, and there they stand ready, till the next squeak of a Philosopher's
Fiddle sets 'em a Dancing again


Sir, here comes the pushing Master.


Then I Will be gone. But you must have a care of Pushing, 'twill spoil the
niceness of your steps. Learn a flourish or two; and that is all a Beau can have
occasion for



Oh, Mr. Nimblewrist, I crave you ten thousand pardons, by the Universe.


That was a home thrust. Good Sir. I hope ya're for a breathing this Morning.
Mockmode, you will make an excellent Swords Man; y're as well shaped for
Fencing as any Man in Europe. The Duke of Burgundy is just of your Make; he
pushes the finest of any Man in France. -- Sa, sa -- like Lightning


I Am much in Love with Fencing: But I think Back-Sword is the best play.


Oh Lard Sir! -- Have you ever been in France, Sir?


No, Sir; but I understand the Geography of it. -- France is bounded on the
North with the Rhine


No, Sir, a Frenchman is bounded on the North with Quart, on the South with
Tierce, and so forth. It Is a Noble Art, Sir; and every one that wears a. Sword
is obliged by his Tenure to learn. The Rules of Honor are engraved on my-Hilt,
and my Blade must maintain 'em: My Sword's my Herald, and the bloody Hand my
Coat of Arms


And how long have you professed this Noble Art, Sir?


Truly, Sir, I served an Apprenticeship to this Trade, Sir.


What are ye a Corporation then?


Yes, Sir; the Surgeons have taken us into their's, because we make so much
work for 'em. -- But, as I was telling you, Sir, I professed this Science till
the Wars broke out: But then, when every body got Commissions, I put in for
one, served the Campaigns in Flanders; and when the Peace broke out, was
disbanded; so among a great many other poor Rogues, am forced to betake to my
old Trade. Now the public Quarrel's ended, I live by private Ones. I live
still by dying, as the song goes, Sir. While we have English Courages,
French-Honour, and Spanish Blades among us, I shall live, Sir


Surely your sword and skill did the King great service a broad.


Yes, Sir, I killed above fifteen of our own Officers by Private Duels in the
Camp, Sir; killed 'em fairly; killed 'em thus, Sir. -- Sa, sa, sa, sa. Parry,
parry, parry, --


What Is the name of that Thrust, pray, Sir?


Oh Lard, Sir, he did not touch me; not in the least, Sir. The Foyl was
cracked, a palpable crack


A very palpable crack truly. Your Skull is only cracked, palpably cracked,
that is all


Well, Sir, if you please to teach me my Honors -- My Dancing Master has
forbid me any more, lest I should discompose my steps


Your Dancing Master is a Blockhead, Sir.



I forgot my Gloves, and so --


Oh Sir, he calls you Blockhead, by the Universe.


Zauns, Sir --


Zoons, Sir.


I have more Wit in the sole of my foot then you have in your whole body.


Ay, Sir, you Caperers daunce-all your Brains into your heels, which makes you
carry such empty Noddles. Your Rational's reversed, carrying your
understandings in your Legs. Your Wit is the perfect Antipodes to other Men's


And what are you good Monsieur, sa, sa? Stand upon your Guard Mr Mockmode,
he is the greatest falsify in his Art; he will fill your head so full of French
Principles of Honor, that you will not have one of Honesty left. His Breast Plate
there he calls the But of Honor, at which all the Fools in the Kingdom shoot,
and not one can hit the Mark


You talk of Robin Hood, who never shot in his Bow, Sir. -- You Dancers are the
Battledoors of the Nation, that toss the light Foppish Shuttlecocks to and
again, to get your selves in heat. -- Have a care, Mr. Mockmode, this Fellow
will make a mere Grasshopper of you. -- Sir, you're the grand Pimp to Foppery
and Lewdness; and the Devil and a Dancing Master, Dance a Corante over the
whole Kingdom


A Pimp, Sir! what then, Sir? I engage Couples into the Bed of Love, but you
match 'em in the Bed of Honor. We only juggle People out of their Chastity,
but you cheat 'em out of their Lives. We shall have you, Mr. Mockmode, grinning
in the Bed of Honor, as if you. laughed at the Fool who must be hanged for
you. -- Which is best, Mr. Nimblewrist, an easy Minuet, or a Tyhurn Jig


Don't provoke my sword, Sir, least that Art you so revile should revenge it
self; for every one of you that live by Dancing should die by Pushing, Sir


And every Man that lives by Pushing, should die Dancing, I take it.


Zoons, Sir! what do you mean?


Nothing, Sir; -- Tal -- dal -- deral. --

This takes the Ladies, Mr. Mockmode; this runs away with all the great
Fortunes in Town. Though you be a Fool, a Fop, a Coward, Dance well, and you
Captivate the Ladies. The moving a man's Limbs pliantly, does the business. If
you want a Fortune, come to me -- Tal -- dal -- deral --


No, no, to me, Sir. -- -- sa, sa, -- does your business soonest with a Woman.
A clean and manly extension of all your parts -- -- Ha -- Carrying a true
point, is the matter. -- Sa, sa, sa, sa. -- Defend your self



Oh goodness! what a Room's here! Could not these fellows wipe their feet
before they came up. And here is such a tripping and such a stamping, that they
have broke down all the Cieling. You Dancing and Fencing-Masters have been the
downful of many Houses. Get out of my Doors; my house was never in such a
pickle. -- You Country Gentlemen, newly come to London, like your own Spaniels
out of a Pond, must be shaking the Water off, and bespatter every body about
you. --


Zauns, Madam --


He Is tainted. These cursed Flies have blown upon him already.


Sa, sa -- Defend Flankonade, Madam.


Ah, Mr. Mockmode, my Pushing and Dancing days are done, But I had a Son, Mr.
Mockmode, that would match you -- Ah my poor Robin! -- he died of an Apoplexy;
he was as pretty a young man as ever stepped in a Black-Leather Shoe: he was as
like you, Mr. Mockmode; as one Egg is like another; he died like an Angel --
But I am sure he might have recovered but for the Physicians -- oh these
Doctor's! these Doctors


Bless the Doctors, I say; for I believe they killed my honest old Father.


Ay, that is true. If my Robin had left me an Estate, I should have said so too.
--


Zauns, Madam, you must not be melancholy, Madam.


Well, Sir, I hope you will give us the Beverage of your fine Clothes. I Will
assure you, Sir, they fit you very well, and I like your fancy mightily


Ay, ay, Madam. But what is most modish for Beverage? for I suppose the fashion
of that alters always with the Clothes


The Tailors are the best Judges of that -- But Champaigne, I suppose.


Is Champaigne a Tailor? Now methinks that were a fitter name for a Wig-maker.
-- I think they call my Wig a Campaigne


You're clear out, Sir, clear out. Champaigne is a fine Liquor, which all you
great Beaux drink to make 'em witty


Witty! Oh by the Universe I must be witty. I Will drink nothing else; I never
was witty in all my life. I love Jokes dearly. -- Here, Club, bring us a Bottle
of what do you call it? the witty Liquor


But I thought all you that were bred at the University should be Wits
naturally


The quite contrary, Madam, there is no such thing there. We dare not have Wit
there, for fear of being counted Rakes. Your solid Philosophy is all read
there, which is clear another thing. But now I will be a Wit by the Universe. I
must get acquainted with the great Poets. Landlady, you must introduce me


Oh dear me, Sir! would you ruin me? I introduce you! no Widow dare be seen
with a Poet, for fear she should be thought to keep him


Keep him! what is that? They keep nothing but Sheep in the Country; I hope they
don't fleece the Wits


Alas, Sir, they have no Fleeces; there is a great cry, but little Wool.
However, if you would be acquainted with the Poets, I can prevail with a
Gentleman of my acquaintance to introduce you; It Is one Lovewell, a fine
Gentleman, that comes here sometimes


Lovewell! By the Universe my Rival; I heard of him in the Country. This puts
me in mind of my Mistress. -- Zauns I Am certainly become a Beau already; for I
was so in love with my self, I quite forgot her. -- I have a Note in my
Pocketbook to find her out by. --

Sixpence for Washing. -- Two pence to the Maid. -- Sixpence for Snush -- One
Shilling for Buttered Ale-By the Universe I have lost the Directions. -- Hark
ye, Madam; Does this same Lovewell come often here, say you


Yes, Sir, very often. -- There Is a Lady of his acquaintance, a Lodger in the
house just now


A Lady of his acquaintance a Lodger in the house just now? of his
acquaintance, do you say


Yes, and a pretty Lady too.


And he comes often here, you say? By the Universe! should I happen to lodge in
the same house with my Mistress? I gad it must be the same. Can you tell the
Woman's Name? -- Stay -- Is her Name Lucinda


Perhaps it may, Sir; but I believe she is a Widow, for she has a young Son,
and I Am sure it is legitimately begotten, for it is the bravest Child you shall
see in a Summers-day; It Is not like one of our puling Brats of the Town here,
born with the Diseases of half a dozen Fathers about it


By the Universe I don't remember whether my Mistress is Maid or Widow: But a
Widow, so much the Better; for all your London widows are devilish rich they
say. She came in a Coach, did she not, Madam


Yes, Sir, yes.


Then it is infalliblly she. -- Does she not always go out in her Coach?


She has not stirred abroad since she came, Sir.


Oh, I was told she was very reserved, tho it is very much of a Widow. I have
often heard my Mother say, that sitting at home and silence were very becoming
in a Maid; and she has often chid my Sister Dorothy for gadding out to the
Meadows, and tumbling among the Cocks with the Haymakers. I gad I Am the most
lucky Son of a Whore; I was wrapped in the Tail of my Mothers Smock, Landlady



Oh but this Lady, Sir. --


Madam here is a Gentleman below wants to speak with you instantly


With me, Child? Sir, I Will wait on you in a minut.



Is that the Witty Liquor? Come, fill the Glasses. Now that I have found my
Mistress, I must next find my Wits


So you had need, Master; for those that find a Mistress, are generally out of
their Wits. --


Come, fill for your self.

But where is the Wit now Club? have you found it?


I gad Master I think it is a very good Jest.


What?


What! why, Drinking. You Will find, Master, that this same Gentleman in the
Straw Doublet, this same Will in the Wisp, is a Wit at the bottom. --


By the Universe now I have it; The Wit lies in the Jingling: All Wit consists
most in Jingling. Hear how the Glasses rhyme to one another


What, Master, are these Wits so apt to clash?


Oh by the Universe, by the Universe this is Wit.

My Landlady is in the right. -- I have often heard their was Wit in breaking
Glasses. It would be a very good Joke to break the Flask now


I find then that this same Wit is very britle Ware. -- But I think, Sir,
'twere no Joke to spill the Wine


Why there is the Jest, Sirrah; all Wit consists in losing; there was never any
thing got by it. I fancy this same wine is all sold at Will's Coffee-house. Do
you know the way thither Sirrah? I long to see Mr. Comic and Mr. Tagrhine,
with the rest of 'em. I wonder how they look! Certainly these Poets must have
something extraordinary in their faces. Of all the Rarities of the Town, I long
to see nothing more than the Poets and Bedlam. -- Come in, Club; I must go
practice my Honors. -- Tal -- dal -- deral. --



Oh Mr. Lovewell! you come just in the nick; I was ready to spoil all, by
telling him that she was a Stranger, and just now come


Well, dear Madam, be cautious for the future; it is the most fortunate chance
that ever befell me. 'Twere convenient we had the other lodgers of our side


There Is no body but Mr. Lyrick; and you had as safely tell a secret over a
Groaning Cheese, as to him


How so?


Why you must know that he has been Lying-in these four months of a Play; and
he has got all the Muses about him; a parcel of the most tattling Gossips


Come, come; no more words; but to our business. I will certainly reward you.
But have you any good hopes of its succeeding


Very well of the 'Squire's side. But I Am afraid your Widow will never play her
part, she is so awkward, and so sullen


Go you and instruct her, while I manage Affairs abroad.


She Is always raving of one Roebuck. Prithee who is this same Roebuck? -- Ah,
Mr. Lovewell, I Am afraid this Widow of yours is something else at the bottom;
I Am afraid there has been a Dog in the Well



So, Sirrah! where have you left the Gentleman?


In a friend's house, Sir.


What friend?


Why, a Tavern.


What took him there?


A Coach, Sir.


How do you mean?


A Coach and Six, Sir, no less, I Will assure you, Sir.


A Coach and Six!


Yes, Sir, six Whores and a Carted Bawd. He picked 'em all up in the street,
and is gone with this splendid Retinue into the Sun by Covent Garden. I asked
him what he meant? he told me, That he only wanted to Whet, when the very sight
of 'em turned my Stomach


The fellow will have his swing, tho he hang for it. However, run to him, and
bid him take the name of Mockmode; call himself Mockmode upon all occasions;
and tell him that he shall find me here about Four in the afternoon, -- Ask no
questions, but fly. -- So. -- His usurping that name gives him a Title to Court
Lucinda, by which I shall discover her Inclinations to Mockmode, whose coming
to Town has certainly occasioned her quarrel with me; while I set the Hound
himself upon a wrong scent, and ten to one provide for Mistristess Trudge by
the bargain. It Is said, one cannot be a Friend and a Lover

But opposite to that, this Plot shall prove;
I Will serve my Friend by what assists my Love.


MEthinks this Livery suits ill my Birth: but slave to Love, I must not
disobey; his service is the hardest Vassalage, forcing the Powers Divine to lay
their Godships down, to be more Gods, more happy here below. -- Thus I, poor
Wanderer, have left my Country, disguised my self so much, I hardly know
whether this Habit or my Love be blindest; to follow one, perhaps, that loves
me not, tho every breath of his soft words was Passion, and every accent Love.
Oh Roebuck



This is the Page, Love's Link-boy, that must light me the way. -- How now,
pretty Boy? has your Lady beaten you? ha? -- This Lady must be a Venus, for she
has got a Cupid in her Family. It Is a wondrous pretty Boy, --


Oh Heaven's! is the Object real, or are my eyes false? Is that Roebuck, or am
I Leantbe? I am afraid he is not the same; and too sure I Am not my self. --


What offense could such pretty Innocence commit, to deserve a punishment to
make you cry


Oh Sir! a wondrous offense.


What was it, my Child?


I pricked my Finger with a Pin, till I made it bleed.


Such little Boys as you, should have a care of sharp things.


Indeed, Sir, we ought; for it pricked me so deep that the sore went to my very
heart


Poor Boy! -- here is a plaster for your sore Finger --


Sir, you had best keep it for a sore Finger.


OF my Conscience the Boy's witty, but not very wise in returning Gold. --
Come, come, you shall take it


That Is the fitter cure for my sore Finger. -- -- The same dear Lips still. Oh
that the Tongue within them were as true


By Heavens this Boy has the softest pair of Lips I ever tasted. I never found
before that Ladys kissed their Pages; but now if this Rogue were not too young,
I should suspect he were beforehand with me. I gad, I must kiss him again. --
Come, you shall take the Money


Oh how he bribes me into Bribery; -- But what must I do whit this Money, Sir?


You must get a little mistress, and treat her with it.


Sir, I have one Mistress already; and they say no man can serve two Masters,
much less two Mistresses. How many Mistresses have you, pray


Umh! -- I gad the Boy has posed me. -- How many, Child? -- Why, let me see. --
There was Mrs. Mary, Mrs. Margaret, Mrs. Lucy, Mrs. Susan, Mrs. Judy, and so
forth; to the number of five and twenty, or thereabouts


Oh ye Powers! and did you love 'em all?


Yes, desperately. -- I would have drank and fought for any one of 'em. I have
sworn and ly'd to every one of 'em, and have lain with 'em all That Is for your
Encouragement, Boy. Learn betimes, Youth; young Plants should be watered. Your
Smock face was made for a Chamber Utensil


And did not one escape ye?


Yes, one did, -- the Devil take her.


What, don't you love her then?


No, faith; but I bear her an amorous grudge still; something between Love and
spite. -- I could kill her with kindness


I don't believe it, Sir; you could not be so hard-hearted sure: Her honorable
Passion, I think, should please you best


O Child! Boys of your age are continually reading Romances, filling your Heads
with that old bombast of Love and Honor: But when you come to my years, you will
understand better things


And must I be a false treacherous Villain, when I come to your years, Sir? Is
Falsehood and Perjury essential to the perfect state of manhood


Pshaw, Children and old men always talk thus foolishly. -- you understand
nothing, Boy


Yes, Sir, I have been in Love and much more than you, I perceive.


It appears then, that there is no service in the World so educating to a Boy,
as a Ladies. -- By Jove, this Spark may be older than I imagine. Hark ye, Sir;
do you never pull of your Ladies Shoes and Stockins? Do you never reach her the
-- Pincushion? Do you never sit on her bedside, and sing to her? ha! -- Come,
tell me, that is my good Boy. --


Yes, I do sing her asleep sometimes.


But do you never waken her again?


No, but I constantly wake my self; my rest's always disturbed by Visions of
the Devil


Who would imagine now that this young shaver could dream of a Woman so soon? --
But what Songs does your Lady delight in most


Passionate ones, Sir; I Will sing you one of 'em, if you will stay.


With all my heart, my little Cherubim. The Rogue is fond of showing his parts.
-- Come, begin

How blessed are Lovers in diguise!
Like Gods, they see,
As I do thee,
Unseen by human Eyes.
Exposed to view.
I Am hid from you;
I Am altered, yet the same:
The dark conceals me,
Love reveals me;
Love, which lights me by its Flame.
Were you not false, you me would know;
For though your Eyes
Could not devise,
Your heart had told you so.
Your heart would beat
With eager heat,
And me by Sympathy would find:
True Love might see
One changed like me,
False Love is only blind.

Oh my little Angel in voice and shape --

I could wish my self a Female for thy sake.


You're much better as you are for my sake. --


Or if thou were a Woman, I would --


What would you? Marry me? would you marry me?


Marry you, Child? No, no; I love you too well for that,. you should not have
my hand, but all my Body at once. -- But to our business. Is your Lady at home


My Lady! What business have you with my Lady, pray Sir?


Don't ask Questions. You know Mr. Lovewell?


Yes, very well. He Is my great Friend, and one I would serve above all the
World -- but his Sister


His Sister! -- Ha! that gives me a twinge for my Sin. -- Pray, Mr. Page, was
Leanthe well when you left her


No, Sir; but wondrous melancholy, by the departure of a dear Friend of hers to
another World


Oh that was the person mentioned in her Letter, whose departure occasioned
your departure for England


That was the occasion of my coming, too sure, Sir. -- Oh, 'twas a dear Friend
to me! the loss makes me weep


Poor tenderhearted Creature! -- But I still find there was not a word of me.
-- Pray, good Boy, let your Mistress know here is one to wait: on her


Your business is from Mr. Lovewell, I suppose, Sir?


Yes, yes.


Then I Will go.


I Have thrown my cast, and am fairly in for it. But an't I an impudent Dog? Had I
as much Gold in my Breeches, as Brass in my Face, I durst attempt a whole
Nunnery. This Lady is a reputed Virtue, of Good Fortune and Quality; I am a
Rakehelly Rascal not worth a Groat; and without any further Ceremony, am going
to Debauch her. -- But hold. -- She does not know that I Am this Rakehelly
Rascal, and I know that she is a Woman, one of eighteen too; Beautiful, Witty.
-- OF my Conscience upon second thoughts, I am not so very Impudent neither. --
Now as to my management, I Will first try the whining Addresses, and see if
she will bleed in the soft Vein



Have you any business with me, Sir?


Thus looked the forbidden Fruit, luscious and tempting. It Is ripe, and will
soon fall, if one will shake the Tree


Have you any business with me, Sir? --


Yes, Madam, the business of mankind; To adore you. -- My Love, like my Blood,
circulates through my Veins, and at every pulse of my heart animates me with a
fresh Passion. -- Wonder not, Madam, at the power of your Eyes, whose painted
Darts have struck on a young and tender heart which they easily pierced, and
which unacustom'd to such wounds finds the smart more painful

Oh Traitor! Just such words he spoke to me.


Hey day. I was never so attacked in all my Life. In love with me, Sir! Did you
ever see me before


Never, by Jove. --

-- Oh, ten thousand times, Madam. Your lovely Idea is always in my view,
either asleep or awake, eating or drinking, walking, sitting or standing;
alone, or in Company, my fancy wholly feeds upon your dear Image, and every
thought is you. -- Now have I told about fifteen lies in a Breath


I suppose, Sir, you are some conceited young Scribler, who has got the
benefits of a first Play in your Pocket, and are now going a Fortune hunting


But why a Scribler, Madam? Are my Clothes so course, as if they were spun by
those lazy Spinsters the Muses? Does the parting of my Fore-top show so thin,
as if it resembled the two withered tops of Parnassus? Do you see any thing
peculiarly Whimsical or ill-natured in my Face? Is my Countenance strained, as
if my head were distorted by a Stranguary of Thought? Is there any thing
proudly, slovenly, or affectedly careless in my Dress? Do my hands look like
Paper moths? I think, Madam, I have nothing Poetical about me


Yes, Sir, you have Wit enough to talk like a Fool; and are Fool enough to talk
like a Wit


You called me Peot, Madam, and I know no better way of Revenge, than to
convince you that I am one by my Impudence. --


Then make me a Copy of Verses upon that, Sir.

How do you like the Subject, Sir?


It Is a very copious one.

-- It has made my Joll rhyme in my Head. This it is to be thought a Poet;
every Minx must be casting his Profession in his Teeth. -- What: Gone


Ay, she knows that making Verses requires Solitude and Retirement.


She certainly was afraid I intended to beg leave to dedicate something. -- If
ever I make Love like a Poetical fool again, may I never receive any favor but
a Subject for a Copy of Verses



I will not dismiss him thus; for fear he Lampoon me. -- Well, Sir, have you done
them


Yes, Madam, will you please to read.


Oh Heaven I can never bear it.

I must devise some means to part 'em.


Sir, your Verses are too rough and constrained. However, because I gave the
occasion, I Will pardons what is past


By the Lord she was angry only because I did not make the first offer to her
Lips

-- Then, Madam, the Peace is concluded?


Yes, and therefore both parties should draw out of the Field.


Not 'till we make Reprizals; I make Peace with Sword in hand, Madam, and till
you return my heart, which you have taken, or your own in exchange, I will not
put up. And so, Madam, I proclaim open War again. --



Oh, Madam! yonder is poor little Crab, your Lap-Dog, has got his head between
two of the Window-bals, and is like to be strangled


Oh Lard, my poor Crabby! I must run to the rescue of my poor Dog; I Will wait on
you instantly. -- Come, come, Page. -- Poor Grabby! --


Oh the Devil chock Crabby! -- Well, I find there is much more Rhetoric in the
Lips than in the Tongue. -- -- Had Buss been the first word of my Courtship, I
might have gained the Outworks by this. Impudence in Love, is like Courage in
War; tho Both blind Chances, because Women and Fortune rule them



Sir, my Lady begs your pardon; there is something extraordinary happened, which
prevents her waiting on you, as she promised


What has Monsieur Crabby rubbed some of the hairs off his Neck? Has he
disordered his pretty ears? she will not come again then


No, Sir; you must excuse her.


Then I Will go be Drunk. -- Harkye, Sirrah; I have half a dozen delicious
Creatures waiting for me at the Sun; you shall along with, me and have your
Chocie. I Will enter you into the School of Venus Child. It Is time you had lost
your Maidenhead, you're too old for Play-things


Oh Heavens! I had rather he should stay then go there.

But why will you keep such Company, Sir?


Nay, if y're for Advice, farewell: Men of ripe understanding should always
despise What Babes only practice, and Dotards advise


Wild as Winds, and unconfined as Air. -- Yet I may reclaim him. His follies
are weakly founded, upon the Principles of Honor, where the very Foundation
helps to undermine the Structure. How charming would Virtue look in him, whose
behavior can add a Grace to the unseemliness of Vice



What is the Gentleman gone?


Yes, Madam. He was instantly taken ill with a violent pain in his Stomach, and
was forced to hurry away in a Chair to his Lodging


Oh poor Gentleman! He Is one of those conceited fools that think no Female can
resist their Temptations. Blockheads, that imagine all Wit to consist in
blaspheming Heaven and Women. -- I Will feed his Vanity, but starve his Love

And may all Coxcombs meet no better Hate,
Who doubt our Sex Virtue, or dare prompt our hate.

Two as good Lines as ever were written. --

I gad I shall maull these topping fellows. -- Says Mr. Lee,

Let there be not one Glimps, one Starry spark,
But God's meet Gods, and justle in the Dark.
Says little Lyrick,
Let all the Lights be burnt out to a Snuff,
And Gods meet Gods, and play at Blind-man's buff.
Very well!
Let Gods meet Gods, and so -- fall out and cuff.
That Is much mended. They Are as noble Lines as ever were penn'p. Oh, here comes
my damned Muse; I Am always in the Humor of writing Elegy after a little of her
Inspiration



Mr. Lyrick, what do you mean by all this? Here you have lodged two years in my
house, promised me Eighteen-pence a week for your Lodging, and I have never
received eighteen farthings, not the value of that, Mr Lyrick


This living on Love is the dearest Lodging -- a Man's eternally dunn'd, tho
perhaps he have less of one ready Coin than the other. -- There Is more trouble in
a Play than you imagine, Madam


There Is more trouble with a Lodger than you think, Mr. Lyrick.


First there is the decorum of Time.


Which you never observe, for you keep the worst hours of any Lodger in Town.


Then there is the exactness of Characters. --


And you have the most scandalous one I ever heard.


Then there is laying the Drama. --


Then you foul my Napkins and Towels. (...)


Then there are preparations of Incidents, working the Passions, Beauty of
Expression, Closeness of Plot, Justness of Place, Turn of Language, Opening the
Catastrophe. --


Then you wear out my Sheets, burn my Fire and Candle, dirty my House, eat my
Meat, destroy my Drink, wear out my Furniture -- I have lent you Money out of
my Pocket


Was ever poor Rogue so ridden? If ever the Muses had a Horse, I am he. --
Faith Madam, poor Pegasus is Jaded


Come, come, Sir, he shall not slip his Neck out of the Collar for all that. Money
I will have, and Money I must have; let your Play and you both be damned


Well, Madam, my Bookseller is to bring me some twenty Guinea's for a few
Sheets of mine presently, which I hope will free me from your Sheets


My Sheets, Mr. Lyrick! Pray what do you mean? I Will assure you, Sir, my Sheets
are finer than any of your Muses spinning. -- Marry come up


Faith you have spun me so fine, that you have almost cracked my Thread of
Life, as may appear by my Spindle-shanks


Why sure -- Where was your Thalia, and your Melpomene, when the Tailor would
have stripped you of your Silk Wastcoat, and have clapped you on a Stone-doublet?
Would all your Golden Verse have paid the Sergeants Fees


Truly, you freed me from Gaol, to confine me in a Dugeon; you did not ransom
me, but bought me as a slave; So, Madam, I Will purchase my freedom as soon as
possible. Flesh and Blood cannot bear it


Take your course, Sir. -- There were a couple of Gentlemen just now to enquire
for you; and if they come again, they shall not be put off with the old story of
your being abroad, I Will promise you that, Sir


Zoons! if this Bookseller does not bring me Money --

Oh, Mr. Pamphlet, your Servant. Have you perused my Poems?


Yes, Sir, and there are some things very well, extraordinary well, Mr. Lyrick:
but I don't think'em for my purpose. -- Poetry's a mere Drug, Sir


Is that because I take Physic when I write? Damn this costive fellow, now he
does not apprehend the Joke


No, Sir; but your name does not recommend'em. One must write himself into a
Consumption before he gain Reputation


That Is the way to lie abed when his Name's up. Now I lie abed before I can
gain Reputation


Why so ad^r?


Because I have scarcely any Clothes to put on. -- If ever man did Penance in a
White Sheet --


You stand only sometimes in a White Sheet for your offenses with your
Landlady. Faith, I have often wondered how your Muse could take such flights,
yoked to such a Cartload as she is


Oh, they are like the Irish Horses, they draw best by the Tail -- Have you
ever seen any of my Burlesque, Mr. Pamphlet? I have a Project of turning three
or four of our most topping fellows into Doggrel. As for Example; --

Conquest with Laurels has our Arms adorned,
And Rome in tears of Blood our anger mourned.
Now, Butchers with Rosemary have our Beef adorned.
Which has in Gravy Tears our Hunger mourned.
How do you like it, Mr. Pamphlet, ha? -- Well --
Like Gods, we passed the rugged Alpine Hills;
Melted our way, and drove our hissing Wheels;
Through cloudy Deluges, Eternal Rills.
Now observe, Mr. Pamphlet; pray observe.
Like Razors keen, our Knives cut passage clean
Through Rills of Fat, and Deluges of Lean.

Very well, upon my Soul.


Hurled dreadful Fire and Vinegar infused.


Ay, Sir, Vinegar! how patly that comes in for the Beef, Mr. Lyrick! It Is all
wondrous fine indeed


This is the most ingenious fellow of his Trade that I have seen; he
understands a good thing. --


No, Sir, Paper is so excessive dear that I dare not venture upon'em.


Well, because you're a Friend, I Will bestow'em upon you. -- Here, take'em all.
-- There Is the hopes of a Dedication still


I give you a thousand thanks, Sir; but I dare not venture the hazard; they will
never quit cost indeed, Sir


This fellow is one of the greatest Blockheads that ever was Member of a
Corporation. -- How shall I be revenged



Sir, there are two Men below desire to have the Honor of kissing your hand.


They must be Knaves or Fools, By their fulsome Complement. Hark ye --


Since you have got Company, Sir, I Will take my leave.


No, no, Mr. Pamphlet, by no means! we must drink before we part. Boy, a Pint
of Sack and a Toast. These are two Gentlemen out of the Country, who will be
for all the new things lately published; they will be good Customers. -- Come,
sit down. -- You have not seen my Play yet? -- Here, take the Pen, and if you
see any thing amiss, correct it; I Will go bring'em up. -- -- Stay, lend me your
Hat and Wig, or I shall take cold going down Stairs


This is a right Poetical Cap; it is Bays the outside, and the Lining Fustian.
--



Sir, you're the King's Prisoner.


That Is a good Fancy enough, Mr. Lyrick. But pray don't interrupt me, I Am in
the best Scene. -- I gad the Drama is very well laid


Come, Sir.


Well, well, Sir, I Will pledge ye. Prithee now good Mr. Lyrick do'nt disturb me.
--

And furious Lightnings brandished in her Eyes.
That Is true Spirit of Poetry.


Zoons, Sir, do you banter us?


Gentlemen -- I beg you pardon. How do you like the City Gentlemen? If you have
any occasion for Books to carry into the Country, I can furnish you as well as
any man about Paul's. Where Is Mr. Lyrick


These Wits are damnable Cunning. I always have double Fees for Arresting one
of you Wits. All your Evasions will not do; we understand trap, Sir; you must not
think to catch old Birds with Chaff, Sir


Zoons, Gentlemen, I Am not the Person; I Am a Freeman of the City; I have good
Effects, Gentlemen, good Effects. Do You think to make a Fool of me I Am a
Bookseller, no Poet


Ay, Sir, we know what you are by your Fools Cap there.


Yes, one of you Wits would have passed upon us for a Corncutter yesterday; and
was so like one, we had almost believed him


Why Gentlemen, Gentlemen, Officers, have a little Patience, and Mr. Lyrick
will come up Stairs


No, no; Mr. Lyrick shall go down Stairs. He would have us wait till some
Friends come into rescue him. Ah these Wits are Devilish Cunning. --



Ha, ha, ha. Very Poetical Faith; a good Plot for a Play, Mr. Mockmode; a
Bookseller bound in Calves-Leather. -- Ha, ha, ha. -- How they walked along
like the three Volumes of the English Rogue squeezed together on a shelf


What was it, what was it, Mr. Lyrick?


Why, I am a States man, Sir. -- I cannot but laugh, to think how they will sponge
the sheet before the Errata be blotted out; and then how he will hamper the Dogs
for false Imprisonment


But pray what was the matter, Mr. Lyrick!


Nothing, Sir, but a Shurking Bookseller that owed me about Forty Guinea's for
a few lines. He would have put me off, so I sent for a couple of Bull-Dogs, and
Arrested him


Oh Lord, Mr. Lyrick, Honesty's quite out of doors; it is a rare thing to find a
man that is a true Friend, a true Friend is a rare thing indeed! -- Mr. Lyrick,
will you be my Friend? I only want that Accomplishment. I have got a Mistress,
a Dancing and Fencing-Master; and now I want only a Friend, to be a fine
Gentleman


Have you never had a Friend, Sir?


Yes, a very honest fellow; our Friendship commenced in the College-Cellar, and
we loved one another like two Brothers, till we unluckily fell out afterward
at a Game at Tables


I find then that neither of ye lost by the fet.

But my short acquaintance cannot recommend me to such a Trust.


Pshaw! Acquaintance? -- You must be a man of Honor, as you're a Poet, Sir.


But what use would you make of a Friend, Sir?


Only to tell my Secreets too, and be my Second. -- Now, Sir, a Wit must be
best to keep a Secret, because what you say to one's prejudice will be thought
malice. Then you must have a Devilish deal of Courage by your Heroic Writing.
--

But know, that I alone am King of Me.

Heavens! sure the Author of that Line must be a plaguey stout fellow; it makes
me Valiant as Hector when I read it


Sir, we stick to what we write as little as Divines to what they preach. --
Besides, Sir, there are other qualifications requisite in a Friend, he must
lend you Money. Now, Sir, I cannot be that Friend, for I want forty Guinea's


Sir, I can lend you fifty upon good security. -- 'Twas the last word my Father
spoke on his Deathbed, that I should never lend Money without security


Fie, Sir! Security from a Friend, and a Man of Honor by his Profession too!


By the Universe, that is true, you are my Friend. Then I Will tell you a Secret
--


Now will this plaguey Wit turn my Nose out of Joint -- I was my Master's Friend
before, though I never found the knack of borowing Money; though I have received
some marks of his Friendship, some sound drubs about the Head and Shoulders, or
so. I have been bound for him too, in the Stocks, for his breaking Windows very
often


Mr. Mockmode, you may be imposed upon. I would see this Lady you court. I know
Mr. Lovewell has a Mistress named Lucinda; but that she lodges in this house, I
much doubt


Imposed upon. That Is very Comical. -- Ha, ha, ha! you shall see, Sir; come. --
Pray Sir, you're my Friend


Nay, pray; Indeed, Sir, I beg your

Pardon; you're a 'Squire, Sir.


Zauns, Sir, you lie, I Am not a Fool; I Will take an affront from no man. --
Draw, Sir


Draw, Sir. -- I gad I Will put his Nose out of joint now.


Unequal numbers, Gentlemen.


I Am only my Master's Friend, his Second, or so, Sir.


What Is the matter, noble Squire?


You lie again, Sir. Zauns, draw. --


Ha! -- a blow! -- Essex, a blow -- yet I will be calm.


Zoons, draw, Sir.


Oh patience Heaven! -- Thou art my Friend still.


You lie, Sir.


Then thou art a Traitor, Tyant, Monster.


Zauns, Sir, you're a Son of a Whore, and a Rascal.


A Scribler.


Ah, ah, -- That stings home. -- Scribler!


Ay, Scribler, Ballad-maker.


Nay then -- I and the Gods will fight it with ye all.

France never will comply
Till her Claret run dry;
Then let us pull away, to defeat her:
He hinders the Peace,
Who refuses this Glass,
And deserves to be hanged for a Traitor.
Now, my Mirmydons fall on; I have taken off the odds.
Dub a dub, dub a dub, to the Battle.
Zoons Gentlemen, why don't ye fight? -- Blood fight. Oblige me so far to fight
a little; I long to see a little sport


Sir, I scorn to show sport to any man.


And so do I, by the Universe.


And I, by the Universe:


I shall take another time.


Here Rascal, take your Chopping-knife, -- gives Club his Sword. and bring me a
Joint of that Coward's flesh for your Masters Supper. -- Fly, Dog. --


Auh! -- This fellow's likeliest to put my Nose out of joint.


Now, Sir, tell me, how you durst be a Coward?


Coward, Sir? I Am a Man of a great Estate, Sir; I have five thousand Acres of
as good fighting ground as any in England, good Terrafirma, Sir, Coward, Sir!
Have a care what you say, Sir. -- My Father was a Parliament Man, Sir, and I
was bred at the College, Sir


Oh then I know your Genealogy; your Father was a Senior-Fellow, and your
Mother was an Air-pump. You were suckl'd by Platonic Idea's, and you have some
of your Mothers Milk in your Nose yet


Form the Proposition by Mode and Figure, Sir.


I told you so. -- Blow your Nose Child, and have a care of dirting your
Philosophical slabbering-bib


What do you mean, Sir?


Your starched Band, set by Mode and Figure, Sir.


Band Sir? -- This fellow's blind, Drunk. I wear a Cravat, Sir?


Then set a good face upon the matter. Throw off Childishness and Folly with
your hanging-sleeves. Now you have left the University, learn, learn


This fellow's an Atheist, by the Universe; I Will take notice of him, and inform
against him for being Drunk. -- Pray, Sir, what is your Name


My name? by the Lord I have forgot. -- Stay, I shall think on it by and by.


Zauns, forget your own Name! your memory must be very short, Sir.


Ay, so it seems, for I was but, Christened this morning, and I have forgot it
already


Was your Worship then Turk or Jew before? -- I knew he was some damned bloody
Dog. --


Sir, I have been Turk, or Jew rather, since; for I have got a plaguey
heathenish Name. -- Pox on it. -- Oh! now I have it. -- Mo -- Mock -- mo --
Mockmode


Mockmode! Mockmode, Sir, Pray how do you spell it?


Go you to your A, B, C. you came last from the University.


Sir, I Am called Mockmode. -- What Family are you of, Sir?


What Family are you of, Sir?


Of Mockmode-Hall in Shropshire.


Then I Am of the same, I believe. -- I fancy, Sir, that you and I are near
Relations


Relations. Sir! There are but two Families; my Fathers, who is now dead, and
his Brothers, Colonel Peaceable Mockmode


Ay, ay, the very same Colonel Peaceable. -- -- Is not he Colonel of Militia?


Yes, Sir.


And was not he High Sheriff of the County last year?


The very same, Sir.


The very same; I Am of that Family. -- And your Father died about -- let me see
--


About half a year ago.


Exactly. By the same token you got drunk at a Hunting-match that very day
seven-night he was buried


This fellow's a Witch. -- But it looks very strange that you should be
Christened this morning. I Am sure your Godfathers had a plaguey deal to answer
for


Oh, Sir, I Am of age to answer for my self.


One would not think so, y're so forgetful. It Is two and twenty years since I
was Christened, and I can remember my name still


Come, we'll take a Glass of Wine, and that will clear our understanding. We'll
remember our friends


You must excuse me, Sir. -- This is some Sharper.


Nay, prithee Cousin, good Cousin Mockmode, one Glass. I know you are an honest
fellow. We must remember our Relations in the Country indeed, Sir


Oh, Sir, you're so short of memory, you can never call 'em to mind. You have
forgot your self, Sir. Mockmode is a Heathenish Name, Sir, and all that, Sir.
And so I beg your pardon, Sir. --


Now were I Lawyer enough, by that little enquiry into that fellow's Concerns,
I could bring in a false Deed to cheat him of his Estate

Where the Devil is thy Master? You said I should find him here.


It Is impossible for you, or me, or any body, to find him.


Why?


Because he has lost himself. The Devil has made a Juglers Ball of him I
believe. He Is here now; then Presto, pass in an instant. He has got some damned
business to day in hand


Ay, so it seems. -- I must be Squire Mockmode, and court an honorable
Mistress in the Devils name! Well, let my sober thinking Friend plot on, and
lay Traps to catch Futurity; I Am for holding fast the present. -- I have got
about twenty Guinea's in my Pocket; and whilst they last, the Devil take George
if he thinks of Futurity. I Will go hand in hand with Fortune

She is an honest, giddy, reeling Punk;
My Head, her Wheel, turn round, and so we both are drunk.


HEre, here,-Page; your Lady has sent you some Sweetmeats; but indeed you
shall not have 'em till you hire me


She sent sower Sauce, when she made you the Bearer.


Prithee now what makes you constantly so melancholy? Come you must be merry,
and shall be merry, I Will get you some Play-things


I believe you want Play-things more than I. -- But I would be private Pindress.


Well, my Child, I Will be private with you; Boys and Girls should still be
private together; and we may be as retired as we please; for my Mistress is
reading in her Closet, and all the Servants are below. -- But what Concerns
have you? I Am sure such a little Boy can have no great business in private


I will try thee for once

-- Yes, Mrs. Pindress, I have great inclination. --


To what? To do what, Sir? -- Don't name it: -- It Is all in vain. -- you shall not
do it, you need not ask it


Only to kiss you. --


Oh fie, Sir! Indeed I Will none of your kisses. Take it back again

Is it not the taste of the Sweetmeats very pretty about my Lips?


Oh hang your liquorish Chaps; you would fain be licking your Lips, I find that.


Indeed, Mr. Page, I will not pay you the Kisses you won from me last night at
Cross-purposes; -- and you shall not think to keep my Pawn neither. -- Pray give
me my Hungary-bottle. -- As I hope to be saved I will have my Hungary-bottle --

-- I Am stronger than you. -- I Will carry you in, and throw you upon the bed,
and take it from you. --


Help! help! I shall be ravished! Help! help!



What Is the matter? -- Oh bless me!


Oh dear Madam, this unlucky Boy had almost spoiled me. Did not your Ladyship
hear me cry I should be ravished? I was so weak, I could not resist the little
strong Rogue; he whipped me up in his arms, like a Baby, and had not your
Ladyship come in --


What, Sirrah, would you debauch my Maid? you little Cock-Sparrow, must you be
Billing too? I have a great mind to make her whip you Sirrah


Oh dear, Madam, let me do it. I Will take him into the Room and I will so
chastise him. --


But do you think you will be able, Pindress? I Will send one of the Men to help
you


No, no, Madam; I could manage him with one hand. -- See here, Madam.


Hold, hold. -- Is this you that the little strong Rogue had almost Ravished?
He snatched you up in his arms like a Baby. -- Ah Pindress, Pindress! I see
you are very weak indeed. -- Are not you ashamed, Girl, to debauch my little Boy


Your Ladyship gave me orders to make him merry, and divert his melancholy, and
I know no better way than to teize him a little. I Am afraid the Boy is troubled
with the Rickets, and a little shaking, Madam, would do him some good


I Am tired with impertinence, and have other business to mind.


I hope your Ladyship entertains no ill opinion of my Virtue.


Truly I don't know what to think on it: but I Have so good an opionion of your
sense, as to believe you would not play the fool with a Child


W'ere all subject to playing the fool, if you continue your Resolution in
marrying of the first man that asks you the Question


No, my mind's changed; I Will never marry any Man.


I dare swear that resolution breaks sooner, than the former. Lovewell should
with an amorous whine and suppliant cringe tell you a formal story, contrary to
what we suspect, would you not believe him


What, believe his vain assertations, before the demonstration of my senses?
No, no; my Love's not so blind. Did I not see his Miss and his Child? did I not
behold him giving her Money? did I not hear him declare he would settle her in
a Lodging


But, Madam, upon serious reflection, where is the great harm in all this? Most
Ladies would be over joy'd at such a discovery of their Lovers ability. The
Child seemed a lusty chopping Boy; and let me tell you, Madam, it must be a
lusty chopping Boy that got it


Urge no farther in his defense; he is a Villain, and of all Villains that I
hate most, an hypocritical one. The Ladies give him the Epithet of modest, and
the Gentlemen that of sober Lovewell. Now methinks such a piece of Debauchery
sits so awkwardly on a person of his Character, that it adds an unseemliness to
the natural vileness of the Vice; and he that dares be a Hypocrite in Religion,
will certainly be one in Love. -- Stay, is not that he


Yes, Madam; I believe he is going to the Park.


Call a couple of Chairs quickly; we'll thither Masqu'd. This day's adventures
argue some intended Plot upon me, which I may countermine by only setting a
Face upon the matter

For as Hypocrisy in men can move,
Here Is the best Hypocrite in Female Love.
On even scores designing Heaven took care;
Since Men false Hearts, that we false Faces wear.


I Will rack thy Reputation, blast thy Fame,
And in strong grinding Satyr Gibbet up thy Name.
What, in a Rapture, Mr. Lyrick?


A little Poetical fury, that is all. -- I Will 'Squire him; I Will draw his
Character for the Buffoon of a Farce; he shall be as famous in Ballad as Robin
Hood, or Little John; my Muses shall haunt him like Demons; they shall make him
more ridiculous than Don Quixote


Because he encountered your Windmill-Pate. -- -- Ha, ha, ha. -- Come, come,
Mr. Lyrick, you must be pacified


Pacified, Sir! Zoons, Sir, he is a Fool, has not a grain of sense. Were he an
ingenious Fellow, or a Man of Parts, I could bear a kicking from him: But an
abuse from a Blockhead! I can never suffer it

Pert Blockhead, who has purchased by the School
Just sense enough to make a noted Fool.
That stings, Mr. Lovewell.

Pray, Sir, let me see it.


This is imperfect, Sir: But if you please to give your Judgment of this Piece.
--


Ay, you Poets mount first on the Shoulders of your Predecessors, to see
farther in making Discoveries; and having once got the upper-hand, you spurn
them under-foot. I think you should bear a Veneration to their very Ashes


Ay, if most of their Writings had been burnt. I declare, Mr. Lovewell, their
Fame has only made them the more remarkably faulty: Their great Beauties only
illustrate their greating Errors


Well, you saw the new Tragedy last night; how did it please ye?


Very well; it made me laugh heartily.


What, laugh at a Tragedy!


I laugh to see the Ladies cry. To see so many weep at the Death of the
fabulous Hero, who would but laugh if the Poet that made 'em were hanged? On my
Conscience, these Tragedies make the Ladies vent all their Love and Honor at
their Eyes, when the same white Hankerchief that blows their Noses, must be a
Winding Sheet to the deceased Hero


Then there is something in the Handkerchief to embalm him, Mr. Lyrick, Ha, ha,
ha. -- But what relish have you of Comedy


No satisfactory one -- My curiosity is fore-stall'd by a foreknowledge of
what shall happen. For as the Hero in Tragedy is either a whining cringing Fool
that is always a stabbing himself, or a ranting hectoring Bully that is for
killing everybody else: so the Hero in Comedy is always the Poet's Character


What Is that?


A Compound' of practical Rake, and speculative Gentleman, who always bears of
the great Fortune in the Play, and Shams the Beau and 'Squire with a Whore or
Chambermaid; and as the Catastrophe of all Tragedies is Death, so the end of
Comedies is Marriage


And some think that the most Tragical conclusion of the two.


And therefore my eyes are diverted by a better Comedy in the Audience than
that upon the Stage. -- I have often wondered why Men should be found of seeing
Fools ill represented, when at the same time and place they may behold the
mighty Originals acting their Parts to the Life in the Boxes. --


Oh be favorable to the Ladies, Mr. Lyrick, it is your Interest. Beauty is the
Deity of Poetry; and if you rebel, you will certainly run the Fate of your first
Parent, the Devil


You're out, Sir. Beauty is a merciful Deity, and allows us sometimes to be a
little Atheistical; and it is so indulgent to Wit, that it is pleased with it,
though in the worst habit, that of Satyr. Besides, there can appear no greater
Argument of our Esteem, than Raillery, because it is still founded upon
Jealousy; occasioned by their preferring senseless Fops and Wealthy Fools to
Men of Wit and Merit, the great Upholders of the Empire


Now I think these Favorites of the Ladies are more Witty than you.


How so, pray, Sir?


Because they play the Fool, conscious that it will please; and you're a Wit,
when sensible that Coxcombs only are encouraged. I wonder, Mr. Lyrick, that a
man of your sense should turn Poet; you will hardly ever find a Man that is
capable of the Employment will undertake it


The reason of that is, every one that knows not a tittle of the matter
pretends to be a judge of it. -- By the Lard, Mr. Lovewell, I put the Critics
next to Plague, Pestilence and Famine in my Litany. -- Had you seen 'em last
night in the Pit, with such demure supercilious Faces -- their contemplative
Wigs thrust judiciously backwards; their hands rubbing their Temples to chaff
ill nature; and with a hissing venomous Tongue pronouncing. Pish! Stuff!
Intolerable! Damn him! -- Lord have mercy upon us


Ay, and you shall have others as foolish as they are ill-natured; fond of
being thought Wits, who shall laugh outragiously at every smutty Jest; cry,
Very well, by Gad; that is fine, by Heavens; and if a Dystich of Rhyme happens,
they clap so damnably loud, that they drown the Jest


That Is the Jest. The Wit lies in their hands; and if you would tell a Poet his
Fortune, you must gather it from the Palmistry of the Audience; for as
nothing's ill said, but what is ill taken; so nothing's well said, but what is
well taken. And betweeen you and I, Mr. Lovewell, Poetry without these laughing
Fools, were a Bell without a Clapper; an empty sounding business, good for
nothing; and all we Professors might go hang our selves in the Bell-ropes


Ha, ha, ha. -- But I thought Poetry was instructive.


Oh Gad forgive me, that is true; To Ladies it is morally beneficial; For you
must know they are too nice to read Sermons; such Instructions are too gross
for their refined apprehensions: but any Precepts that may be instilled by
easy Numbers, such as of Rochester, and others, make great Converts. Then they
hate to hear a fellow in Church preach methodical Nonsense, with a Firstly,
Secondly, and Thirdly: but they take up with some of our modern Plays in their
Closet, where the Morallity must be Devilish Instructive. -- But I must be
gone; here comes the 'Squire. What in the name of wonder has he got with him


That which shall afford you a more plentiful Revenge than your Lampoon, if you
join with me in the Plot. To the better effecting of which, you must be
seemingly reconciled to him. --

Let Us step aside, and observe 'em while I give you a hint of the matter.



This is very fine Weather, blessed Weather indeed, Madam; 'twill do abundance
of good to the Grass and Corn


Ay, Sir, the Days are grown a great length; and I think the Weather much
better here than in Ireland


Why, Madam, were you ever there?


Oh no, not I indeed, Sir; but I have heard my first Husband (Rest his Soul)
say so; he was an Irish Gentlemen


I find, Madam, you have loved your first Husband mightily, for you affect his
tone in discourse. -- Pray, Madam, what did that Mourning cost a Yard


Oh Lard, what shall I say now? it is none of mine.

It cost, Sir; let me see -- it cost about -- but it was my Steward bought it
for me, I never buy such small things


By the Universe she must be plaguey Rich; I will be brisk.

Pray, Madam -- I -- I pray Madam, will you give us a Song?


A Song! Indeed then I had a good voice before, Mr. Roebuck spoiled it.


Mr. Roebuck? was that your first Husband's Name, Madam?

She Will spoil all.


No, Sir; Roebuck was a Doctor, that let me blood under the Tongue for the
Quinsey, and made me hoarse ever since


By the Universe she is a Widow, and I will be a little brisk. Madam, will you
grant me a small favor, and I will bend upon my knees to receive it. --


What is it, pray?


Only to take off your Garter.

Zoons, her thick Leg will discover all. -- By your leave, Sir, have you any
pretensions to this Lady


I don't know whether this be an affront or not. --


No, Sir.


No, Sir! I gad that must be Wit, for it cannot be good Manners. -- Sir, I
respect all men of sense, and would therefore beg to know your Name


No matter, Sir; I know your Name's Mockmode.


By the Universe, that is very Comical! that a fellow should pretend to tell me
my own Name! -- Another Question, if you please, Sir


What is it, Sir?


Pray Sir, what is my Christened Name?


Sir, you don't know.


Zauns, Sir, would you persuade me out of my Christened Name? I Will lay you a
Guinea that I do know, by the Universe. --

Here Is Silver, Sir, here is Silver, Sir; I can command as much Money as
another, Sir; I am at Age, Sir, and I will not be bantered. Sir


Sir, you must know, that I baptize you Rival; for your Love to this Lady, is
the only sign of Christianity you can boast of. -- And now Sir, my name's
Lovewell


Then I say, Sir, that your Love to that Lady is the only sign of a Turk you
can brag of. -- I wish Club were come


Sir, I shall certainly Circumcise you, if you make any farther pretensions to
Madam Lucinda here


Circumcise me! Circumcise a Puddings end, Sir. -- Zauns, Sir, I Will be judged
by the Lady who merits Circumcission most, you or I, Sir. These London-Blades
are all stark mad; --

I met one about two hours ago, that had forgot his Name, and this fellow would
persuade me now that I had forgot mine. Mr. Lyrick is the only man that speaks
plain to me. I must be Friends with him, because I find I may have occasion for
such a Friend; I Will find him out strait


Madam, will you walk. --



Now my doubts are removed.


Mine are-more puzzling. There must be something in this, more than we imagine.
You had best talk to him


Yes, if my Tongne bore Poison in it, and that I could spit Death in his face.


If he is lost, your hard usage this morning has occasioned it.


I Am glad on it; I Have gained by the loss, I despise him more now than e're I
loved him. That Passion which can stoop so low as that Blowze, is an Object too
mean for any thing but my scorn to level at


This were a critical minute for your new Lover the 'Squire I fancy; Mr.
Lovewell's disgrace would bring him into favor prefently


It certainly shall, if he be not as great a Fool as t'other's false.


You may be mistaken in your opinion of him, as much as you have been in Mr.
Lovewell


No, Pindress, I shall find what I read in the last Miscellanies very true.

But two distinctions their whole Sex does part;
All Fools by Nature, or all Rogues by Art.
SCENE continues.



'Sdeath! what a Coney-burrough's here! The Trade goes swimingly on. This is
the great Empory of Lewdness, as the Change is of Knavery. -- The Merchants
cheat the World there, and their Wives gull them here. -- I begin to think
Whoring Scandalous, it is grown so Mechanical. -- My modesty will do me no good,
I fear. -- -- Madam, are you a Whore


Yes, Sir.


Short and pity. -- If ever Woman spoke truth, I believe thou have.

Have you any business with me, Madam?


Pray, Sir be civil; you're mistaken, Sir. -- I have had an Eye upon this
fellow all this afternoon.


Very likely, Madam; for I imagined you modest.


So I am, for I Am married.


And married to your forrow, I warrant you!


Yes, upon my Honor, Sir.


I knew it. I have met above a dozen this Evening, all married to their Sorrow.
-- Then I suppose you're a Citizen's Wife; and by the broadness of your bottom,
I should geuss you sat very much behind a Counter


My Husband's no Mercer, he is a Judge.


Zoons! A Judge! I shall be arraigned at the Bar for keeping on my Hat so long.
-- It Is very hard, Madam, he should not do you Justice: Has not he an Estate in
Tail, Madam


I seldom examine his Papers; They are a parcel of old dry shrvel'd Parchments;
and this Court-hand is so devilish crabbed, I cannot endure it


Umph! -- Then I suppose, Madam, you want a young Lawyer to put your Case to.
But faith, Madam, I Am a Judge too


Oh Heavens forbid! such a young Man?


That Is, I Will do nothing without a Bribe. -- Pray, Madam, how does that Watch
strike


It never strikes, it only points to the business, as you must do, without
telling Tales. Dare you meet me two hours hence


Ay, Madam, but I shall never hit the time exactly without a Watch.


Well, take it. -- At Ten exactly, at the Fountain in the Middle Temple. Cook
upon Littleton be the word


So -- If the Law be all such Volumes as thou, Mercy on the poor Students. From
Cook upon Littleton in Sheets deliver me



What! engaged Mirmydon! I find you will never quit the Battle till you have
cracked a Pike in the Service


Oh dear friend! you are critically come to my Relief; for faith I Am almost
tired


What a miserable Creature is a Whore! whom every Fool dares pretend to love,
and every Wise Man hates


What, morallizing again! Oh I Will tell thee News, Man; I Am entered in the Inns,
by the Lard


Pshaw!


Nay, if you will not believe me, see my Note of admission.


A Gold Watch, boy?


Ay, a Gold Watch, boy,


Whence had you money to buy it?


I took it upon tick, and I design to pay honestly.


I don't like this running of the Score. -- But what News from Lucinda, boy? Is
she kind? ha



Ha! there is a stately Cruiser; I must give her one chase. -- I Will tell you
when I return


I find he has been at a loss there, which occasions his eagerness for the Game
here. I begin to repent me of my suspicion; I believe her Virtue so sacred that
it is a piece of Atheism to distrust its Existence. But jealousy in Love, like
the Devil in Religion, is still raising doubts which without a firm Faith in
what we adore, will certainly damn us



Is your name Mr. Roebuck, Sir?


What would you have with Mr. Roebuck, Sir?


I have a small Note for him, Sir.


Let me see it.


Ay, Sir, if your name be Mr. Roebuck, Sir.


My Name is Roebuck, Blockhead.


God bless you, master.


This is some tawdry Billet, with a scrawling Adieu at the end on it. These
strolling Jades know a young wholesome fellow newly come to Town, as well as a
Parsons Wife does a fat Goose. It Is certainly some secret, and therefore shall
be known

SIR, MY behavior toward you this morning was somewhat strange; but I shall
tell you the cause of it, if you meet me at Ten this night in our Garden; the
Backdoor shall be open

Yours Lucinda.



Oh Heavens! certainly it cannot be! L, U, C, I, N, D, A; that spells Woman.
'Twas never written so plain before. Roebuck, you are as true an Oracle, as
she is a false one. Oh thou damned Sybil! I have courted thee these three years,
and could never obtain above a Kiss of the hand, and this fellow in an hour or
two has obtained the back door open. Mr. Roebuck, since I have discovered some
of your Secrets, I Will make bold to open some more of 'em. -- But how shall I
shake him off? -- Oh, I have it; I Will seek him instantly



Here, you Sir, have you a Note for one Roebuck?


I had, Sir; but I gave it to him just now.


You lie, Sirrah, I am the Man.


I an't positive I gave it to the right person; but I Am very sure I did; for he
answered the Description the Page gave to a T, Sir


'Twas well I met that Page, Dog, or now should I cut thy Throat, Rascal.


Bless your Worship, Noble Sir.


At Ten, in the Garden! the backdoor open! -- Oh the delicious place and hour!
soft panting breasts! trembling Joints! melting Sighs! and eager Embraces! --
Oh Ecstasy! -- But how to shake off Lovewell? -- This is his nicely Virtuous!
Ha, ha, ha. -- This is his innate Principle of Virtue? Ha, ha, ha



How now why so merry?


Merry! why, 'twou'd make a Dog split, Man; Ha, ha, ha. -- The Watch Sir, the
Watch; Ha, ha, ha


What of the Watch? you laugh by the hour; you will be run down by and by sure.


Ay, but I shall be wound up again. This Watch I had for a Fee, Lawyer: --
Should I ever be tried before this Judge, how I should laugh, to see how
gravely his Goose-Caps sits upon a pair of Horns. Ha, ha, ha


You Are Horn-mad. Prithee leave impertinence. I received a Note just now.


A Note! 'Sdeath, what Note! what do you mean? who brought it?


A Gentleman; it is a Challenge.


Oh, thanks to the Stars; I Am glad on it.


And you may be signally serviceable to me in this affair. I can give you no
greater testimony of my Affection, than by making so free with you


What needs all this formality? I Will be thy second, without all this
impertinence


There Is more than that, Friend. In the first place, I don't understand a
Sword; and again, I Am to be called to the Bar this Term, and such a business
might prejudice me extteamly. So, Sir, you must meet and fight for me


Faith, Lovewell, I shall not stick to cut a Throat for my Friend at any time, so
I may do it fairly, or so. -- The hour and place


This very Evening, in Moorfields.


Umph! How will you employ your self the while?


I Will follow you at a distance, lest you have any foul play.


Which if you do. No, faith Ned, since I Am to answer an appointment for you,
you must make good an assignation for me. I Am to meet one of your Ladies at the
Fountain in the Temple to night. You may be called to the Bar there, if you
will. This Watch will tell you the hour, and shall be your Passport. Let me
have yours. --


Oh, was that the Jest? Ha, ha, ha. -- Well, I will answer an Assignation for
you sure enough. Ha, ha, ha. -- How read ly does the Fool run to have his
Throat cut


How eagerly now does my moral Friend run to the Devil, having hopes of Profit
in the Wind! I have shabb'd him off purely. -- But prithee, Ned, where had you
this fine Jewel


Pshaw! a Trifle, a Trifle; from a Mistress. -- Take care on it though. But hark
ye, Goerge; don't push too home; have a care of whipping through the Guts


Gad I Am afraid one or both of us may fall. But do you hear, Ned, remember you
sent me on this Errant, and are therefore answerable for all mifchief; if I do
whip my Adversary through the Lungs, or so remember your set me upon it


Well, honest George, you will not believe how much you oblige me in this
Courtesy


You know always I oblige my self by serving my Friend. -- I never thought this
Spark was a Coward before


I never imagined this Fellow was so easy before. --


That you're a Fool.


That you're an Ass.



Mr. Lovewell, a word w'ye.


Let it be short, pray Sir, for my business is urgent, and it is almost dark.


I Am reconciled to the Squire, and want only the Presentment of a Copy of
Verses, to ingratiate my self wholly thoroughly. Let me have that piece I lent
just now


Ay, ay, with all my heart: -- Here, -- Farewell.


Now, Sir, here is a Poem, (which according to the way of us Poets) I say was
written at fifteen; but between you and I it was made at five and twenty


Five and twenty! -- When is a Poet at Age, pray Sir?


At the third night of his first Play; for he is never a Man till then.


But when at years of discretion?


When they leave Writing, and that is seldom or never.


But who are your Guardians?


The Critics, who with their good will, would never let us come to Age. But
what have you got there


By the Universe, I don't know; it is a Woman's hand; some Billet-deux, I
suppose; it justl'd out of Lovewell's Pocket. We'll to the next Light, and read
it



Oh how I reverence a back-dore half open, half shut! It Is the narrow Gate to
the Lovers Paradise; Cupid stood Centry at the entrance; Love was the Word, and
he let me pass -- Now is my friend pleading for Life; he has a puzzling Case to
manage Ten to one he is Nonsuted; I have gulled him fairly



I Have got in, thanks to my Stars, or ^ather the Clouds, whose influence is my
best Friend at present. Now is Rocbuck gazing, or rather groping about for a
Fellow with a long sword; and I know his fighting humor will be as mad to be
balked by an Enemy, as by a Mistress


Hark, hark! I hear a Voice; it must be she. -- Lucinda!


True to the touch, I find. Is it you, my Dear


Yes, my Dear.


Let me embrace thee, my heart.


Come to my Arms. --


'Slife! a Man!


'Sdeath! a Devil! -- And were thou a Legion, here is a Wand should conjure thee
down --


We should find whose Charms is strongest.



Mr. Roebuck? Sir? Mr. Roebuck?


That Is a Woman's Voice, I Will swear. -- Madam? --


Sir.


Come, my dear Lucinda; I Have staid a little too long; but making an Apology now
were only lengthening the offense. Let Us into the Arbor, and make up for the
moments misspent


Hold, Sir. Do you love this Lucinda you're so fond of hauiing into the Arbor?


Yes, by all that is powerful.


False, false Roebuck! --


Madam, do you love this Roebuck, that you opened the Garden door to so late?


I Am afraid I do too well.


And did you never own an affection to another?


No, witness all those Powers you just now mentioned.


Revenge your selves, ye Heavens. Behold in me your Accuser and your Judge.
Behold Lovewell, injured Lovewell. -- This darkness, which opportunely hides
your blushes, makes your shame more Monstrous


Ha! Lovewell! I Am vexed it is he, but glad to be mistaken. -- Now Female Policy
assist me


Yes, Madam, your silence prolaims you Guilty -- Farewell Woman.


Ha, ha, ha.


What am I made your scorn?


Ha, ha, ha. -- This happens better than I expected. -- Ha, ha, ha. -- Mr.
Lovewell


No Counter-plotting, Madam, the Mine Is sprung already and all your deceit
discovered


Indeed you're a fine fellow at discovering deceits, I must confess, that could
not find whether I was a Man or a Woman all this time


What, the Page!


No Counter-plotting, good Sir, the Mine Is sprung already. -- Ah, Sir, I fancy
Mr. Roebuck is better at discovering a Man from a Woman in the dark, than you


This discovery is the greatest Riddle! -- Prithee, Child, what makes thee
disguised? But above all, what meant that Letter to Roebuck


Then I find you intercepted it. -- Why, Sir, my Lady had a mind to put a trick
upon the impudent Fellow, made him an Assignation, and sent me in her stead, to
banter him, But when I tell her how you fell into the snare, and how jealous
you were. -- Ha, ha, ha


Oh my little dear Rogue! was that the matter? --


A Man! 'Twas certainly Roebuck. --

He certainly was here, and I have missed him.
Fortune delights with Innocence to play,
And Love's to hoodwink those already blind.
Wary deceit can many by-ways tread,
To shun the blocks in Virtues open Road,
Whilst heedless Innocence still falls on Ruin
Yet, whilst by Love inspired, I will pursue;
What Men by Courage, we by Love can do.
Not even his falsehood shall my Claim remove;
From mutual Fires none can true passion prove;
For like to like, is Gratitude, not Love.


ON what new happly Climate am I thrown?

This house is Loves Labyrinth; I have stumbled into it by chance. -- Ha! an
Illusion! Let me look again. -- Eyes, if you play me false, (Looking about)
I Will pluck ye out. -- It Is she; it is Lucinda! alone, undressed, in a
Bedchamber, between Eleven and Twelve a Clock. -- A blessed opportunity! --
Now if her innate Principle of Virtue defend her, then is my innate Principle
of Manhood not worth Twopence. -- Hold, she comes forward. --


Unjust Prerogative of faithless Man,
Abusing Power which partial Heaven has granted!
In former Ages, Love and Honor stood
As Props and Beauties to the Female Cause;
But now lie prostitute to scorn and sport.
Man, made our Monarch, is a Tyrant grown,
And Womankind must bear a second Fall.

Ay, and a third too, or I Am mistaken. -- I must divert this plaguey Romantic
humor


While Virtue guided Peace, and Honor War,
Their Fruits and Spoils were offerings made to Love.

And it is so still; for (Raising his Voice.)
Beau with earliest Cherries Miss does grace,
And Soldier offers spoils of Flanders Lace.

Ha! -- Protect me Heavens! what art thou?


A Man, Madam.


What accursed Spirit has driven you hitherto?


The Spirit of Flesh and Blood, Madam.


Sir, what Encouragement have you ever received to prompt you to this Impudence?


Umph! I must not own the reception of a Note from her. Faith, Madam, I know
not whether to attribute it to Chance, Fortune; my good Stars, my Fate, or my
Destiny: But here I am, Madam, and here I will be


If a Gentleman, my Commands may cause you withdraw; If a Russian, my Footmen
shall dispose of you


Madam, I Am a Gentleman; I know how to oblige a Lady, and how to save her
Reputation. My Love and Honor go linked together; they are my Principles: and
if you will be my Second, we'll engage immediately


Stand off, Sir; the name of Love and Honor are burlesqu'd by thy Professing
'em. Thy Love is Impudence, and thy Honor a Cheat. Thy Mien and Habit show
thee a Gentleman? but thy behavior is Brutal. Thou art a Centaur; only one
part Man, and the other Beast


Philosophy in Peticoats! No wonder Women wear the Breeches;


Honorable Love is the Parent of mankind; but thine is the Corruptor and
Debaser of it. The Passion of you Libertines is like your Drunkeness; heat of
Lust, as the other is of Wine, and off with the next Sleep


No, Madam; an Hair of the same -- is my Receipt -- Come, come, Madam, all
things are laid to rest that will disturb our Pleasure, whole Nature favors
us; the kind indulgent Stars that directed me hither, wink at what we are
about. 'Twere Jilting of Fortune to be now idle, and she, like a true Woman,
once balked, never affords a second opportunity. -- I Will put out the Candle,
the Torch of Love shall light us to Bed


To Bed, Sir! Thou have Impudence enough to draw thy Rationality in Question.
Whence proceeds it? From a vain thought of thy own Graces, or an opinion of my
Virtue? -- If from the latter, know that I am a Woman, whose modesty dare not
doubt my Virtue; yet have so much Pride to support it, that the dying Groans of
thy whole Sex at my feet should not extort an immodest thought from me


Your thoughts may be as modest as you please, Madam. -- You shall be as
Virtuous to morrow morning as e're a Nun in Europe, the opinion of the World
shall proclaim you such, and that is the surest Charter the most rigid Virtue in
England is held by. The Night has no Eyes no to see, nor have I a Tongue to
tell: One kiss shall seal up my Lips for ever


That uncharitable Censure of Women, argues the meaness of thy Convertation.


Her superior Virtue awes me into coldness. 'Slife! it cannot be Twelve sure.
-- -- Night's a Liar


Sir, if you will not be gone, I must fetch those shall Conduct you hence. --! my
Eyes are dazzled sure,


By Heavens she has a mind to it! -- Oh, it is at your service with all my Soul.


Wrong not my Virtue by so poor a thought. -- But answer directly, as you are a
Gentleman, to what I now shall ask: whence had you that Jewel


I exchanged Watches with a Gentleman, and had this Jewel into the bargain. He
valued it not, 'twas a Trifle from a Mistress


A Trifle said he? -- Oh Indignation! slighted thus! -- I Will put a Jewel out of
his power, that he would pawn his Soul to retrieve. -- If you be a Gentleman,
Sir, whom Gratitude can work up to Love, or a Virtuous Wife reclaim, I Will make
you a large return for that Trifle


Hey-day! a Wife said she!


What Is your Name, Sir? and of what Country?


My Name's Roebuck, Madam.


Roebuck.


'Sdeath! I forgot my Instructions. -- Mockmode, Madam. -- Roebuck Mockmode, my
Name, and Surname


Mockmode my 'Squire! it cannot be! But if it should, I Have made the better
Exchange. -- Of what Family are you, Sir


Of Mockmode-Hall i^ Shropshire, Madam. My Father's lately dead; I came lately
from the University; I have fifteen hundred Acers of as good fighting Ground as
any in England. -- 'Twas lucky I met that Blockhead to day


The very same. -- And had you any directions to couat a Lady in London.


Umph! -- How should I have found the way hither else, Madam. What the Devil
will this come to


My Fool that I dreamt of, I find a pretty Gentleman. -- Dreams go by
contraries. -- Well, Sir, I am the Lady; and if your Designs are Honorable,
I Am yours, take a turn in the Garden, till I send for my Chaplain, you must
take me immediately, for if I cool, I Am lost for ever


I think I am become a very sober Shropshire Gentleman in good earnest; I don't
start at the name of a Parson. -- Oh Fortune! Fortune! what art thou doing? If
thou and my Friend will throw me into the arms of a fine Lady, and great
Fortune, how the Devil can I help it! Oh but, Zoons, there is Marriage! Ay, but
there is Money. -- Oh but there are Children; sqawling Children. Ay but then
there are Rickets and Smallpox, which perhaps may carry them all away. -- Oh
but there is Horns! Horns! Ay, but then I shall go to Heaven, for it is but
reasonable, since all Marriages are made in Heaven, that all Cuckolds should go
thither. -- But then there is Leanthe! That sticks. I love her, witness, Heaven,
I love her to that degree. -- Pshaw, I shall whine presently. I love her as
well as any Woman; and what can she expect more? I cannot drag a Lover's Chain a
hundred Miles by Land and a hundred Leagues by Water. -- Fortune has decreed it
otherwise. -- So lead on, blind Guide, I follow thee; and when the blind lead
the blind, no wonder they both fall into -- Matrimony

Oh my dear auspicious little Mercury! let me kiss thee. -- Go tell thy
Charming Mistress I obey her Commands



Her Commands! Oh Heavens! I must follow him.


Page, Page.


Oh my cursed Fortune! balked again! -- Madam.


Call my Chaplain; I Am to be married presently.


Married so suddenly! To whom, pray Madam?


To the Gentleman you met going hence just now.


Oh Heavens! your Ladyship is not in earnest, Madam?


What, is Matrimony to be made a Jest of? don't be impertinent, Boy; call him
instantly


What shall I do? -- Oh, Madam, suspend it till the morning, for Heaven's sake.
Mr. Lovewell is in the House; I met him not half an hour ago; and he will
certain^^ kill the Gentleman, and perhaps harm your Ladyship


Lovewell in my house! How came he hither?


I know not, Madam, I saw him and talked to him; he had his Sword drawn, and he
threatened every body. Pray delay it to night, Madam


No, I Am resolved; and I Will prevent his discovering us; I Will put on a suit of
your Clothes, and order Pindress to carry her Night Gown to the Gentleman in
the Garden, and bid him meet me in the lower Arbor, in the West Corner, and
send the Chaplain thither instantly


Hold, Fortune, hold; thou have entirely won;
For I am lost. Thus long I have been racked
On thy tormenting Wheel, and now my Heart Strings break.
Discovering who I am, exposes me to shame.
Then what on Earth can help me?


Oh Lord, Page, what is the matter? Here Is old doings, or rather new doings.
Prithee let you and I throw in our Twopence a piece into this Marriage-Lottery


You Will draw nothing but Blanks, I Will assure you, from me. -- But stay, let me
consider of the business


No consideration; the business must be done hand over head.


Well, I have one Card to play still; and with you, Pindress.


You expect though that I should turn up Trumps?


No, not if I shuffle right.

-- Well, Pindross, it is a Match. Be gone to the lower Arbor at the West Corner
of the Garden, and I Will come to thee immediately with the Chaplain. You must
not whisper, for we must pass upon the Chaplain for my Lady and the Gentleman.
-- Haste


Shall Not I put on my New Gown first?


No, no; you shall have a Green Gown for your Wedding in the Arbor.


A Green Gown? -- Well, all Flesh is Grass.


Make haste, my sponse, fly.


And will you come? will you be sure to come? -- O my litlte Green Gooseberry,
my Teeth waters at ye. --


Now Chance. -- No, you are blind.

Then Love, be thou my Guide, and set me right;
Though blind, like Chance, you have best Eyes by Night.


Mr. Lyrick abroad, say thou? and Mockmode with him?


All abroad, my Mistress and all.


I don't understand this. -- Brush, run to Lucinda's Lodgings, and observe
what is a doing there: I spied some hasty Lights glancing through the Rooms; I Will
follow you presently

-- Cannot you inform me which way they went:


Perhaps Mr. Mockmodes's man can inform ye.


Pray call him.


Mr. Club, Mr, Club.


What is the follow deaf?


No, Sir; but he is asleep, and in bed. -- Mr. Club, Mr. Club.


Augh --

I Am asleep, I Am asleep; don't wake me. -- Augh.


Here Is a Getleman wants ye.



Pox of your London-breeding; what makes you waken a Man out of his sleep that
way


Where Is your Master, pray Sir?


Augh. -- It Is a sad thing to be broken of ones rest this way.


Can you inform me where your Master's gone?


My Master? -- Augh --


Yes, Sir, your Master,


My Master? -- Augh -- What a Clock is it, Sir? I believe it is past Midnight,
for I have gotten my first sleep -- Augh. --


You Are asleep still, Blockhead. Answer me, or -- where is your Master?


Augh -- I had the pleasantest Dream when you called me -- Augh -- I thought my
Master's great black Stone-horse, had broke loose among the Mares -- Augh --
and so, Sir, you called me -- Augh -- and so I wakened


Sirrah,


Zauns, Sir! what do you mean, Sir? My Master's as good a Man as you, Sir; Them
me, Sir


Tell me presently, where your Master is, Sirrah, or I Will dust the secret out
of your Jacket


Oh, Sir, your Name's Lovewell, Sir!


What then, Sir?


Why then my Master is -- where you are not, Sir. -- My Master's in a fine
Ladies Arms, and you are -- liere, I take it


Has he got a Whore a Bed with him?


He may be Father to the Son of a Whore by this time, if your Mistress Lucindae
be one, Mr. Lyrick did his business, and my Master will do her business I
warrant him, if of the right Shropshire breed which I Am sure he is, for my
Mother nursed him on my Milk


Two Calves suckl'd on the same Cow -- Ha, ha, ha. Gramercy Poet, has he
brought the Play to a Catastrophe so soon? A rare Executioner, to clap him in
the Female Pillory already! Ha, ha, ha


Ay, Sir; and a Pillory that you would give your Ears for, I warrant you think
my Master's over head and ears in the Irish Quagmire you would have drowned him
in. But, Sir, we have found the bottom on it


He may pass over the Quagmire, Sirrah, for there were Stepping stones laid in
his way


He has got over dry-shod, I Will assure you. -- Pray, Sir, did not you receive a
Note from Lucinda, the true Lucinda, to meet her at Ten in her Garden to Night.
-- Why don't you laugh now? Ha, ha, ha


'Sdeath, Rascal, What Intelligence could you have of that?


Hold, Sir, I have more Intelligence. You threw Mr. Lyrick his Poem in a hurrey
in the Park, and justled that sweet Letter out of your Pocket, Sir. This Letter
fell into my Master's hands, Sir, and discovered your Sham, Sir, your Trick,
Sir. Now Sir, I think you're as deep in the Mud as he is in the Mire


Cursed misfortune! -- And where are they gone, Sir? Quickly, the Truth, the
whole Truth, Dog, or I Will spit you like a Sparrow


I design to tell you, Sir. Mr. Lyrick, Sir, being my Master's intimate Friend,
or so, upon a Bribe of a hundred Pounds, or so, has sided with him, taken him
to Lucinda's Garden in your stead, and there is a Parson, and all, and so forth.
-- Now, Sir, I hope the Poet has brought the Play to a very good Cata -- Cata
-- what do you call him, Sir


'Twas he I incounter'd in the Garden. -- 'Sdeath! Tricked by the Poet! I Will
cut off one of his Limbs, I Will make a Synelepha of him; I Will --


He, he, he! -- Two Calves sucked on the same Cow! -- He, he! --


Nay then I begin with you.


Zauns! Murder! Them me! Zauns! Murder! Zauns!


I have been peeping and crouching about like a Cat a Mousing. Ha! I smell a
Rat -- A Sword and Hat! -- There are certainly a pair of Breeches appertaining
to these, and may be lap'd up in my Ladies Lavender, who knows! --



What, Sir? What are you doing? I Am ruined tricked. --


I believe so too, Sir. -- See here. --


By all my hopes, Roebuck's Hat and Sword. This is mischief upon mischief. Run
you to the Garden, Sirrah; and if you find any body, secure 'em; I Will search
the House. -- I Am ruined! -- Fly. -- Roebuck? -- what hoa? -- Roebuck? -- hoa



Dear, dear Lovewell, wish me Joy, wish me Joy, my Friend.


Of what, Sir?


Of the dearest, tenderst, whitest, softest Bride, that ever blessed Man's Arms.
I Am all Air, all a Cupid, all Wings, and must fly again to her embraces. Detain
me not, my Friend


Hold, Sir, I hope you mock me; though that it self's unkind.


Mock you! -- By Heavens no; she is more than sense can bear, or Tongue express.
-- Oh Lucinda! should Heaven --


Hold, Sir; no more.


I Am on the Rack of Pleasure, and must confess all.
When her soft, melting white, and yielding Waste,
Within my pressing Arms was folded fast,
Our lips were melted down by heat of Love,
And lay incorporate in liquid kisses,
Whilst in soft broken, sighs, we caught each other's Souls.

Come, come, Roebuck, no more of this Extravagance. -- By Heaven I swear you
shall not marry her


By Heaven I swear so too, for I Am married already.


Then you are a Villain.


A Villain, Man! -- Pshaw! that is Nonsense. A poor fellow can no sooner get
married, than you imagine he may be called a Villain presently. -- You may call
me a Fool, a Blockhead, or an Ass, by the Authority of Custom: But why a
Villain, for God's sake


Did not you engage to meet and fight a Gentleman for me in Moorfields?


Did not you promise to engage a Lady for me at the Fountain, Sir?


This Lucinda is my Mistress, Sir.


This Lucinda, Sir; is my Wife.


Then this decides the matter. -- Draw.


Prithee be quiet, Man, I Have other business to mind on my Wedding-night. I must
in to my Bride


Hold, Sir; move a step, and by Heavens I Will stab thee.


Put up, put up; Pshaw, I an't prepared to dye; I an't, Devil take me.


Do you dally with me, Sir?


Why you will not be so unconseionable as to kill a Man so suddenly; I have not made
my Will yet. Perhaps I may leave you a Legacy


Pardon me Heaven's, if pressed by stinging taunts, my Passion urge my Arm to
act what is foul


Hold.

It Is safest making Peace, they say, with Sword in hand. -- Pll tell thee what,
Nod; I would not lose this Nights Pleasure for the honor of fighting and
vanquishing the Seven Champions of Christendom. Permit me then but this Night
to return to the Arms of my dear Bride, and faith and troth I Will take a fair
Thrust with you to morrow morning


What, beg a poor Reprieve for Life! -- Then you are a Coward.


You imagined the contrary, when you employed me to fight for ye in Moorfields.


Will nothing move thy Gall? -- You Are ^ase ungrateful.


Ungrateful! I love thee, Ned; by Heavens, my Friend, I love thee. therefore
name not that word again, for such a repetition would over-pay all thy favors


A cheap, a very cheap way of making acknowledgment, and therefore thou have
caught, which makes thee more ungrateful


My Friendship even yet does balance Passion; but throw in the least grain more
of an affront, and by Heaven you turn the Scale


(Pausing.) No, I Have thought better; my Reason clears: She is not worth my
Sword; a Bully only should draw in her defense, for she is false, a Prostitute


A Prostitute! By Heaven thou lie.

-- Thou have blasphemed. Her Virtue answers the uncorrupted state of Woman, so
much above Immodesty, that it mocks Temptation. She has convinced me of the
bright Honor of her Sex, and I stand Champion now for the fair Female Cause


Then I have lost what naught on Earth can pay. Curse on all doubts, all
Jealousies, that destroy our present happiness, by mistrusting the future. Thus
mis-believers making their Heaven uncertain, find a certain Hell. -- And is she
Virtuous? -- sound the bold charge aloud, which does proclaim me Guilty


By Heavens as Virtuous as thy Sister.


My Sister; -- Ha! -- I fear, Sir, your Marriage with Lucinda has wronged my
Sister; for her you courted, and I heard she loved you


I courted her, it is true, and loved her also; nay, my Love to her, rivall'd my
Friendship toward; and had my Fate allowed me time for thought, her dear
remembrance might have stopped the Marriage. But since it is past, I must own to
you, to her, and all the World, that I cast off all former Passion, and shall
henceforth confine my Love to the dear Circle of her Charming Arms from which I
just now parted



I take you at your word. These are the Arms that held you.


Oh Gods and Happiness! Leanthe!


My Sister! Heavens! it cannot be.


By Heavens it can, it shall, it must be so -- For none on Earth could give
such Joys but she -- Who would have thought my Joys could bear increase?
Lovewell, my Friend! this is thy Sister! it is Leanthe! my Mistress, my Bride,
my Wife


I am your Sister, Sir, as such I beg you to pardon the effects of violent
passion, which has driven me into some imprudent Actions; But none such as may
blot the honor of my Virtue, or Family. To hold you no longer in suspense,
'twas I brought the Letter from Leanthe; 'twas I managed the Intrigue with
Lucinda; I sent the Note to Mr. Roebuck this afternoon; and I --


That was the Bride of happy me.


Thou art my Sister, and my Guardian-Angel; for thou have blessed thy self, and
blessed thy Brother. Lucinda still is safe, and may be mine


May! -- She shall be thine, my Friend.


Where is Lucinda?



Not far off; though far enough from you, by the Universe.


You must give me leave not to believe you, Sir.


Oh Madam, I crave you ten thousand pardons by the Universe, Madam. -- Zauns,
Madam, Them me, Madam


By your leave, Sir --


Ah, Cousin Mockmode! -- How do all our Friends in Shropshire? --


Now, Gentlemen, I thank you all for your Trick, your Sham. You imagine I have
got your Whore, Cousin, your Crack'. But Gentlemen, by the assistance of a
Poet, your Sheely is Metamorphos'd into the real Lucinda; which your Eyes shall
testify. Bring in the Jury there. -- Guilty or not Guilty



Oh my dear Reobuck! And Faith is it you, dear Joy? and where have you been
these seven long years


Zauns! --


Hold off, stale Iniquity. -- Madam, you will pardon this? -- (To Leanthe.


Indeed I will not live with that stranger. You promised to marry me, so you did.
-- Ah Sir, Neddy's a brave Boy, God bless him; he is a whole arm full; Lord
knows I had a heavy load of him


Guilty, or Not Guilty, Mr. Mockmode?


It Is past that; I am condemned, I Am hanged in the Marriage Noose -- Hark ye,
Madam, was this the Doctor that let you blood under the Tongue for the Quinsey


Yes, that it was, Sir.


Then he may do so again; for the Devil take me if ever I breath a Vein for ye:
-- Mr. Lyrick, is this your Poetical Friendship


I had only a mind to convince you of your 'Squireship.


Now, Sister; my fears are over. -- But where is Lucinda? how is she disposed of?


The fear she lay under of being discovered by you, gave me an opportunity of
imposing Pindress upon her instead of this Gentleman, whom she expected to wear
one of Pindress's Night-Gowns as a Disuise. To make the Cheat more current, she
disguised her self in my Clothes, which has made her pass on her Maid for me;
and I by that opportunity putting on a Suit of hers, past upon this Gentleman
for Lucinda, my next business is to find her out, and beg her pardon, endeavor
her reconcilement to you, which the discovery of the mistakes between both will
easily effect


Well, Sir, (To Lyrick.) how was Plot your carried on?


Why this 'Squire (will you give me leave to call you so now?) this 'Squire had
a mind to personate Lovewell, to catch Lucinda -- So I made Trudge to personate
Lucinda, and snap him in this very Garden. -- Now Sir, you will give me leave to
write your Epithalamiu^


My Epithalamiu^ I my Epitaph, Screech Owl, for I Am Buried alive. But I hope
you will return my hundred pound I gave you for marrying me


No, But for Five hundred more I Will unmarry you. These are hard times, and men
of industry must make Money


Here Is the Money, by the Universe, Sir, a Bill of Five hundred pound Sterling
upon Mr. Ditto the Mercer in Cheapside. Bring me a Reprieve, and it is yours


Lay it in that Gentleman's hands.

The Executioner, shall cut the Rope.

Here Is Revelation for you! --


Oh thou damned Whore of Babylon!


What, Pope Joan the second! were you the Priest?


Of the Poet's Ordination.


Ay, ay, before the time of Christianity the Poets were Priests.


No wonder then that all the World were Heathens.


How do you like the Plot? would it not do well for a Play? -- My Money, Sir. --
(To Roebuck


No, Sir, it belongs to this Gentlewoman. -- Lyrick.



You have told me Wonders.


Here are these can testify the truth. This Gentleman is the real Mr.
Mockmode, and much such another person as your dream represented


I hope, Madam, you will pardon my dissembling, since only the hopes of so great
a purchase could cause it


Let my wishing you much Joy and Happiness in your Bride testify my
reconciliation; And at the request of your Sister, Mr. Lovewell, I pardon your
past Jealousies. You threatened me, Mr. Lovewell, with an Irish, Entertainment
at my Wedding. I wish it present now, to assist at your Sisters Nuptials


Army last going hence, I sent for 'em, and they are ready.


Call 'em in then.


I must reward your Sister, Mr. Lovewell, for the many Services done me as my
Page. I therefore settle my Fortune and my self on you, on this Condition, That
you make over your Estate in Ireland to your Sister, and that Gentleman


It Is done; only with this Proviso, Brother, That you forsake your
Extravagancies


Brother, you know I always slighted Gold;

But most when offered as a sordid Bribe.
I scorn to be bribed even to Virtue;
But for bright Virtues sake, I here embrace it.
I have espoused all Goodness with Leanthe,
And am divorced from all my former Follies.
Woman's our Fate. Wild and Unlawful Plames
Debauch us first, and softer Love reclaims.
Thus Paradise was lost by Woman's Fall;
But Virtuous Woman thus restores it all.
