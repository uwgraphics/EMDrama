Flutes, Trumpets, and all manner of Music. etc

His Lordship having taken the Oaths before the Barons of the Exchequer,
returns with the same Attendants and Splendour to Dorset Stairs, where, at his
Landing, he is saluted by the Artillery Company, in all their Martial Ornaments
in Buff and Silver Head-Pieces; and thus, with the whole Cavalcade, moves
forward toward Cheap Side. In his March, he is first entertained with this
Pageant

A Large Fabric, designed after the Corinthian Order, elevated with four
Marble Columns fluited with Gold, and twisted round with Laurels of Flowers.
Above the Etableture of Gold and Silver are erected four Noble Golden Cups,
being part of the Bearing of the Company's Arms. In the middle of all this
Noble Building, on a Quadrangular Seat, sits UNION in Chief; with a Chaplet of
Flowers on a Golden Headpiece, and a Laurel of Oak, signifying Love and
Wisdom. The Attributes or Graces attending on UNION, are three other Persons
richly habited with their proper Ornamento, being Piety, Harmony, and
Diligence, with the Ensigns and Banners of the Company's Arms

WHen sacred UNION holds her Seat Divine,
The sweetest Harmony of Power is Mine.
By Me is the Great Hinge of Empire moved,
The Magistrate obeyed, and Prince beloved.
But when true UNION joins all Hearts and Hands,
It Is only when some Darling Head commands.
So Rules Great WILLIAM: So, my Lord, shall You;
A Copy from that Great Original so true,
As Caesar to His Throne; You to Your Chair,
Have brought the Universal Darling there.





A Large and Spacious Work-shop of several Artificers, distinct in their proper
Apartments for the several Operators in the Mystery of the Goldsmiths,
containing Forges, Anvils, Hammers, and other Instruments of Art, etc. In the
middle of this Laboratory, on a rich Golden Chair of State, is seated St.
Dunstan, the ancient Patron and Guardian of the Company, arrayed in his
Pontifical Ornaments, expressing his Prelatical Dignity, in a Surplice of white
Lawn, over which he wears a large Cope, etc. On his Reverend Hoary Head, a
Golden Mitre beset with precious Stones and Pearls of great Value: In his Left
Hand he holds a Golden Crosier; in his Right Hand a Pair of Goldsmiths Tongs,
an Emblem of his Patronage; and under his Feet lies the Devil

On each side this Noble Seat is placed Apollo and Esculapius his Son, in their
proper Habits, bearing the City's and Company's Banners, and playing on several
Melodious Instruments, as well for his Lordship's Diversion, as to preserve a
Harmony and Decorum among the Artificers

Beneath the Steps of Ascension to the Canonical Chair, in opposition to the
Patron, is placed a Goldsmiths Forge, with Fire and Crucibles filled with Gold;
a Boy blowing the Bellows. On either Hand, in the Front of this Shop, is set up
a large Press of Gold and Silver Plate, with Compters, etc. representing a
formal Shop of Trade: On each side are Jewellers at Work, with Anvils, Hammers,
Stones, Sparks; besides a Planisher, a Raiser, a Drawer and Chacer, etc.
Several Artificers beating out Plate, and fashioning several Vessels of Gold
and Silver: Likewise an Essay-Master with his Class, Frame and Balance, for
trying of Gold and Silver by the Standard. In another Apartment is Disgrossing,
Flatting and Drawing of Gold and Silver Wire. In another are included Finers
and Refiners, Melting, Smelting, Fining, Refining and Separating Gold and
Silver, both by Fire and Water; and the Master-Forger and three other Workmen
making a Massy Piece of Plate, Singing and keeping Time on the Anvil

Here His Lordship is addressed by St. Dunstan.

THE Triumphs of this Day, deserved so well,
When Fame shall in Recorded Story tell,
Those Oracles of Truth --

Can You speak Truth?

Peace, snarling Devil! Thus I Will stop your Mouth.
Down to thy Hell, there croak, thou Fiend accursed,
See this great Day, and swelled with Envy, burst.
In ancient Times when Saints were once adored,
St. Dunstan was the Goldsmiths Patron Lord:
And whilst on this proud glittering Stage I stand,
With all this shining Treasure on each Hand;
What though the World worships the Saint no more,
Still there is whole Thousands that my Shrine adore
A thousand homaging Eyes this Sight behold;
Not me their Idol, but my Shop of Gold.
But let that Superstition end: Here Is all
That does a juster Righteous Homage call;
Whilst your Illustrious Triumphs to attend,
Both Shrine and Saint to You, my Lord, must bend.
That Nobler Luster my pleased Eyes behold,
Your Richer Virtues far outshine my Gold.

ASTRAEA, the Goddess of Justice, in a long Robe of Silver, a Crimson Mantle
fringed with Silver, a Veil of Silver fringed with Gold; on her Head a Plume of
white Feathers set with precious Stones: In her Right Hand a Touchstone; in
her Left a Golden Balance with Silver Scales

At a Descent beneath this Goddess are placed Charity and Concord, as the
necessary Supporters of Justice; and on a Seat remote, sits another Virtue,
called Truth, supporting the Reins, and guiding the Chariot of Justice. This
stately Chariot is drawn by two Unicorns, most exquisitely Carved and Gilded
with equal Proportion to the Life. On the Backs of these two Unicorns are
mounted two Beautiful Young Princes, one a Barbarian, the other an European,
sounding forth the Fame of the Honorable Company of Goldsmiths. At the Feet of
these most Noble Creatures is seated four other Virtues, as Prudence,
Temperance, Courage, and Conduct, all properly attired, each holding a Banner
displayed with the Kings, the Lord Mayors, the City's and Company's Arms

JUstice of old by long Oppression driven,
Left the Tyrannick World and flew to Heaven.
But when Great NASSAW, Albion's Scepter bore,
Our Laws and Rights sent kindly to restore,
She visited the Albion World once more.
Thus whilst our Caesar yields a Trust so large,
As proud Augusta to Your Guardian Charge.
As He from Heaven His Sovereign Justice drew;
He Is Heavens Vicegerent, His Vicegerent, You.
Astraea then must here her Power resign,
Her brightest Glories in Your Hand shall shine.
You Will best, my Lord, my Righteous Balance hold,
No Poise so even as in the Scales of Gold.


TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE COMPANY OF GOLDSMITHS;

The Prints of these Pageants as a lasting Monument of this year's Triumphs,
are humbly dedicated.



THIS Pageant being the Representation of the true Merit that has raised His
Lordship to that Honorable Dignity; in the chief Seat in Front sits a noble
Figure personating HONOR, with the Banner of the City's; on his Head a Silver
Headpiece and a stately Plume of Crimson Feathers, his Vest embroidered with
Gold, Silver, and precious Stones; a Robe of Scarlet enriched with Embroidery
of Tissue, with Buskins, and a Silken Scarf fringed with Gold

On the same Basis, in three other Seats, are planted Peace, Plenty, and
Liberality, properly dressed, as the suitable Attributes and Attendants on
HONOR. At the Feet of these are laid the four Principal Rivers of Trade, as
Tiber, Nile, Danube, and Thames, with their several Hierogliphicks, in Rich
Habits, with Garlands of Flowers, and Banners flying, etc

Ths Structure is formed of the Compositive Order, most nobly set forth with
Painting and Carving in Gold and Silver to an infinite Luster, being made of
that precious Stone called Lapis Lazuli. On the upper part over each Pilaster
are four Pyramids of Trophies of Armor, Bows, Quivers, etc. being the ancient
Emblem of Honor, Love and Virtue, and crowned with the Four Imperial Crowns of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland

WHilst my best Wreath decks those Deserving Brows,
To her loved Lord the pleased Augusta bows:
Augusta, who Your humble Suppliant, calls
Once more for her old Hospitable Walls:
She wants to see her ancient Greatness reign,
When her proud CHAIR did all that State maintain;
That Visiting Princes filled her PRAETOR's Train.
Why do I court You to perform that Task,
When that is already granted e're I ask?
Doubt not her ancient Grandeur You Will restore,
You Will be Your SELF, and she needs ask no more.
His Lordship here moves to Guild Hall to Dinner, being Graced by the Lords of
the Council, the Judges, and the chief Nobility of England, His Honorable
Guests; where the Solemnity of the Day is concluded with all the Festival
Magnificence and Splendour suitable to so most Noble an Entertainment

TO Britain's Dread Caesar, we'll tune up our Joy:
To Caesar, and Caesar's Great City-Viceroy:
It Is Caesar has lent him the Scales and the Sword,
And Augusta salutes him her Guardian Lord.
Whilst the World all around her,
'Twixt Envy and Wonder,
Shall see her proud Chair like the Throne shine in Gold.
Of War he has ended the Toil and the Pain;
And WILLIAM's Work now is to Smile and to Reign.
In the soft Sweets of Peace, in one Olive Bower,
The Crown and the Chair, the whole Scepter of Power,
All blooming like Aaron's old Wand we behold;
Whilst calmly possessing
The Halcyon Blessing,
We'll merrily troll round the Goblets of Gold.
The Ermin and Fir, the Robe and the Gown,
On this side the Chaplet, on that side the Crown,
Together shall taste that General Joy,
Which the whole Power of Hell shall never destroy:
Our Albion thus blessed, this Scene to behold,
The Day shall shine brighter,
The Sun gallop lighter,
And Phoebus new-burnish his Chariot of Gold.
