NOble Spectators, this play that you will see,
Is taken out of Britains History;
It is not pleasant, nor yields much delight,
But it did serve the Poetress to write;
She bids me tell you, she was glad to take
Any dull plot, so she a play could make,
Her vacant idle time for to employ;
For she loves writing more than Company;
But if it pleases not your Eyes or sight,
She does not care, since it pleased her to write;
For she endeavors, tryes all that she may
To please her self in every honest way;
Wherefore a praise, or yet applause from you,
She expects not, nor challenges as her due.
DEar Madam, why does your Highness weep?


As fear frights tears from the Eyes, so grief does send them forth.


Why should your Highness grieve?


Have I not cause, when I am married to a person which does not love, but
rather hate me


Certainly he has reason to love you, and he were worse than a Devil if he
should hate you; as first to love you for your virtue and sweet disposition;
next for the honor, dignity, and Kingdom, he has got by his marring you: for
he has no right to the Dukedom but by your Highness, and by your Highness he
is become an absolute Prince, and injoyes a rich Kingdom


But he has taken the power from me, and strives to disposess of me of my
right


He cannot, the Kingdom will never suffer him, for your title is so just, as
he can make no pretense to disposess your Highness from your Princely Throne


But I being his Wife, he takes the power of a Husband, and by that power, the
power of my Kingdom, and those that have the power can frame their titles as
they please, none dare oppose them


The truth is, Madam, that might overcomes right.


The Factions and divisions that are in this Kingdom will be a means to
deliver it into the power of the Enemy


This Duke is young, wild, deboist and inconstant, wherefore there is but
little hopes it should be better governed


But the Duchess who is the true owner of it, is discreet, wise, and virtuous,
and having more years than he, she might help to rule and order state affairs


But neither her discretion, wisdom, nor virtue has power, for marriage has
inthralled her, for she is become her Husbands Slave, who ought to be his
Sovereign, but he laughs and does despise her, because she is somewhat elder
than himself


Heaven will revenge her wrongs.


Have you been with the Lady I sent you to?


Yes.


And does she listen to Loves Suit?


She seems well pleased to hear her Beauty praised, but will not hear of
Amorous imbracements as yet


But it is a good Omen when as a Lady will nimblingly bite at a bait of
flattery; but did you see her Husband


No Sir.


Well, you must go again, and present her with a Letter, and a present from me;
for Ladies must be plied though they deny, yet most do yield upon a treaty,
they cannot long hold out loves fierce assaults


Indeed the Female Sex is tender and weak, although they are delicate and sweet.


They are false and often betray themselves.


O Madam, Madam, news is come that the Enemy has got into the heart of the
Kingdom; wherefore sweet Lady fly, for they will possess themselves of this
City soon


I will not fly, for I cannot meet a worse Enemy than the Duke himself, should
worse than Mankind Conquer it; but I wish my Sister were safe


The young Princess I hear is fled to the Dukes Brother.


I am glad of it, for he is discreetly temperate, although his Brother is not.


Sir, what will your Highness do?


I will go and oppose the Enemy.


Alas Sir you have no forces to oppose them withal, you may go to be
destroyed, but not to destroy; wherefore you with your small forces had better
fly than fight


Whither shall I go?


To any Prince that will receive you into pay, by which you may maintain your
self, and live with some respect and same abroad, though you have lost your
Kingdom; whereas if you stay, you will lose your self and Kingdom too


Your Counsel I will take.


But what will your Highness do with your Duchess?


Let her do what she will with her self, I care not now, for since her Kingdom
is lost, I have no use of her


Not as concerning the Kingdom Sir, but yet she is your Highnesses Wife, and
as a Husband you ought to regard her


She will follow me, for Wives stick so close to their Husbands as they cannot
be shaken off


Pray Madam do not marry so much below your self.


Why? what matter whom I marry, since I can create my Husband to Honor.


But Madam, that Honor will do him no good, nor will it take off your
disgrace; for none will give your Husband, if he be an inferior person, the
Place and Respect that is due to Great Princes Titles


No, but he shall take Place, and my Servants shall give him the Respect and
Homage that is due to great Titles: For I will make him a Prince; and who dare
call him any other, but Prince


There is none will call him Prince, unless your own Servants; and none will
give him Place, that are above the degree of his Birth: no, nor he durst not
take it of Gallant Noble Men; for if he offers thereat, they will beat him
back, and force him to give way, and to be only a Prince in his own House, and
not abroad, is no better than to be a Farmer, nay, a Cobbler, or a Tailor, or
any the like are Kings in their own Houses, although they be but thatched, if
they have but a Servant subject, or Subject Servant


Well, say what you will, I will make him a Prince.


Sir, does not your Highness hear that your Duchess is gone with your Enemies
into the Country


Yes, and though I might curse my Enemies for dispossessing me of the Kingdom I
enjoyed, yet I give them thanks for carrying my Wife away with them: for now I
have more room and liberty to Woo and Court my Mistress


Sir, the Lady Beauties Husband's dead.


So I perceive Fortune will be my Friend some ways, although she is my Foe
other ways: for she will Crown me with Love, although she uncrowns me with
Power: wherefore return presently back to my Mistress, and tell her, that now
her Husband is dead, and my Wife gone into another Country, We may marry


But your Highness cannot marry, as long as the Duchess is alive.


I mean to be like the Great Turk, have many Wives.


Why, the Great Turk has but one chief Wife, the rest are but as Concubines:
for only the Sons of that chief Queen shall be Successors to the Emperor,
unless she has none; neither can his other Children inherit, unless he be
Right and Lawful Emperor: So, that unless your Highness had been Duke by
Inheritance, as an Inhereditary Duke, no Children, by any other Lady, can be
Inheritors, nor indeed Princes, unless they were begot on the Right Owner to
that Title


Well, since I have no Power, but only an empty Title, I cannot disadvantage
my self, or children: for I have no children as yet, and I have neither Power,
nor Kingdom now: Wherefore, if I can enjoy her upon these terms, as the name
of Wife, it will be well


But Sir, this part of the World allows but of one wife, wherefore if you
should marry this Lady, the Clergy will excommunicate you, as an Adulterer, and
the Lady, as an Adulteress, out of the Church


I had rather be in the Ladies bed, than in the Church: But I have money,
although I have lost my Dukedom, and that will help me


But not make your Marriage lawful.


I care not; for if the marrying, and the name of wife will satisfy the Lady,
I care not whether it be Good or Bad, Lawful or unlawful, Wife or Concubine,
it is all one to me; for I willl marry a hundred women, if they will marry me,
and let me lie with them


Your Highness bears afflictions more courageously than I thought your Highness
would have done


Truly, I find I am more happy since I am amongst my Enemies (if they may be
termed so) than I was in my own Country with an unkind Husband: for they allow
me a Noble and Princely Pension: and I live Free, Easily and Peaceably, which I
did not before


I hear your Sister is married to the Dukes Brother.


I wish she may be more happy with her Husband, than I have been with mine.


If they have Children, and your Highness none, they will be Heirs to the
Dukedom


They will so, but there is no Dukedom now to heir, it is made now a Province.


But times may change.


Now you are an absolute Duchess, you must carry your self in State, and live
Magnificently, like as an Absolute Princess as you are


Yes, but it is a great affliction for the Duke and I to be banished, and
driven out of our Kingdom


Alas Madam, great Princes have many times great misfortunes; but you must
bear your misfortunes with a Princely magnaminity


But if I have Children, alas what shall they do?


But those that did never enjoy the possession, cannot repine, nor grieve for
the loss


You say true.


Pray Madam do not marry so meanly, for you cannot entitle him a Prince.


Well, well, say what you will, I will make him a Prince; for why may not I as
well make my Husband lawfully a Prince, as well as the Duke of Inconstancy
makes the Lady Beauty a Duchess, and yet has another Wife


In Troth it will be just like a poor Beggar Woman in Engl. being mad she said
she was Queen Elizabeth of Engl., and all the Boys, Girls, and Common people
would run after her, and call her Queen Elizabeth in sport and jest; the like
was a poor mad Beggar Man in France, which said he was King Henry the 4th. of
France; but the only difference will be, that you and the Comical Duchess have
means and wealth enough to live in Principy, and they had none, but were so
poor they were forced to beg, so could not Act their parts


You are a bold rude wench, therefore get you out of my service.


Truly I would not stay in it if I might, for I should be ashamed.


Madam, does your Highness here of the Apocriphal Duchess?


What Apocriphal Duchess?


Why the Duke has married another Lady.


That he cannot, until I dye, it is true a Mistress may take the name of a
Wife, but cannot possess the right of a Wife


She will be as a Duchess in a Play, she will only act the part of greatness.


Indeed most Stage Players are Curtizans.


And most Curtizans are good Actors.


I make no question but she will now have enough Spectators.


But I hope they will hiss her from off the Stage.


Have I married you who was a mean fellow, and have not I made you a Prince,
and you to deny to pay my Debts


But I thought you would have rather inricht me, than have made me poorer than
I was


Have I not enriched you with Titles? do not all my Servants call you Prince?
and do not all the Tradesmen where we buy all our Commodities, when they come
to our Palace do the same, call you Prince, and do you reverence


Yes for hopes of gain.


I am sure you will gain little reputation or respect if you carry your self so
sneakingly as you do, whereas you should carry your self like a Prince, bravely


Put when all our money is gone we shall be but poor Princes: I had better have
keep to my Trade than to have been a Prince, where if I had I should have been
rich, now I shall be a Beggar


You are so mean a fellow as you cannot be sensible of the honor and dignity I
have bestowed upon you


All the great Ladies are so envious at your Highness, as there will none of
them come near you


I like the Company of Bourgers Wives better, for they are my Slaves.


Yes Madam, but your Highness is forced I think to present them with some
presents now and then; for the World is so wicked, that they will not give true
honor it is due, unless they are bribed


You say true, but men will give Ladies their due right.


Yes, men are more generous and bountiful to Ladies; but yet they must be
bribed with hopes of obtaining some favors, otherwise, I fear me they would
be as reserved, and retired from your Highnesses Court as the great Ladies are


I wonder they should, I being an absolute Princess.


Yes, but since your Titles, Rights and Marriage is renounced against, they are
not so civil, dutiful, and obedient as they were, not considering as they
ought to do, that right cannot be renounced against


But her Highness does show them their error, and that she shows them it cannot
be taken from her; for she keeps the same State she did, and is as Merry, Gay
and Frollick, to let the World see, she understands her own Greatness best


But yet there are but few of any Nation, but the inferior sort, that come to
her Highness Court, unless it be the Red Oker Knights and Ladies, and if it
were not for them, this Court would be empty


Indeed I am obliged to them more than any other Nation, for they give me all
the due Respects and Homage to my Greatness; for which I love that Nation very
well


You have reason, but I do observe there is nothing does keep up a Court more
than Dancing, and several sorts and kinds of merry pastime; for wheresoever
there is Dancing and Sport, Company will flock together


You say true.


I find my self full of pain; I believe I shall fall in Labor.


I hope then we shall have a young Prince, or Princess soon.


I Saw Prince Shadow.


What Prince is he?


Why he is the Creating Princess's Husband, who made him a Prince.


I thought no women could give Title to their Husbands, unless they had been
Sovereigns


O yes, all women can give their Husbands Titles, if they please.


What Title?


Why the title of Cuckolds.


Indeed most women do magnify their Husbands by those Titles.


But let me tell you, that those women that have Inheritary Honors, although
not Sovereigns, may indue their Husbands with the same Honor: but it is not
generally so; but his Children begot on her are endued, and not the Husband,
yet some Husbands are. As for Example; a Lord, Vicoun^, Earl, Marquess, Duke,
King, or Emperor, if the Honor, as Title, goes to the Female, for default of
a Male, in some Nations their Husbands are endued with their Titles, but not
commonly known to be so in England; as a Wife with her Husband, which is only
during life, and not Inhereditary: but if their Titles are only during life,
and not Inhereditary, it cannot derive to another, that i^ not an Successor^
for Inhereditary Honor go like Intailed Lands, it goes only to the next
Heir; but those that are the dignified, are like those that have Joynters, or
Annuitles for life; so when a Husband receives a Dignity from a Wife, or a
Wife from a Husband, it is but so much Honor for life


But if they have Children, those Children inherit the Honor.


Yes, as having a right from that Parent that is the Dignifyer, but if there be
none of the line of the Dignifyer, the Honor dies, neither is the root of the
Honor left to any more than one: for though the branches of Honor spread to
all the Children, yet the root remains but with one: For, say a King have many
Children, they are all Princes, but yet there can be but one that can inherit
the Crown and Royalty: So if a Marquess, or Duke have many Children, they are
all Lords and Ladies, if they be lawfully, and in true Wedlock born, otherwise
they are not: neither does any more but one of the Legitimate Children inherit
the Root, as to be Marquess or Duke, Duchess or Marchioness: neither do the
Daughters inherit, if there be Sons


But cannot a Dukes Daughter make her Husband a Prince?


No, not except she has the Inhereditary Honor: for if a Kings Daughter
should marry a private Gentleman, he would remain as only in the Title of a
Gentleman, unless the King did create a Title for him, or bestow a Title on him


Why? put case the Inhereditary Honor lay in the people, and they elect a
King, has that King no power to Create, or to give Honor


No, they may choose Officers, but not give Titles, unless the people did
dispossess them of their hereditary power, and give it to any man, and then the
root of Honor lies in him


Nor does his Children receive no Titles from their Father?


No, for the Title he has, is none of his, he has it but during life, unless
the people will give a Lease, as for two or three Lives, yet they nominate
those two or three Lives: So neither can they dispose of their Leases, or alter
them, but at the peoples pleasure; like as those that are made Governors, they
cannot dispose of their Governments to whom they please, as without the leave
of those that placed them in the Government, neither do his Children receive
any Titles therefrom; like as a Lord Mayor, his Son is not my Lord Mayor after
him, unless he is made one; nor his children have no place by his Office, and
an elective Prince, is but as a Lord Mayor, or rather like as a Deputy
Governor, who as I said, may dispose of Places or Offices, but not give
Dignities, Honors, or Titles


I thank you for your Information, for I was so ignorant, as I knew nothing of
Heraldry


HAve you seen the Imaginary Queen yet?


What Imaginary Queen?


Why a Great Queen, that every one goes to kiss her hand.


From what parts of the World came she?


From the North parts.


And do so many go to kiss her hand?


Yes, throngings of Common people.


They would kiss the Dogs Tail if it were turned up and presented to them: but
do any of the Nobles and Gentry kiss her hand


Some few that are newly come out of the Country to see sights in the City.


Pish, in this Age there are so many of these kind of Bedlams, as I am weary to
hear of them, as the Comical Duchess, the Creating Princess, and the Created
Prince, Prince Shadow, and now the Imaginary Queen


Why Faith it is as good a sight as to see a Play.


A puppet Play you mean; but the truth is, it is a disgrace to all noble
persons, and great dignities, and true titles, to be thus mocked by imitators,
it is a sign that all Europe is imbroiled in Wars so much as every one does
what they list


Why they are so far from being checked or discountenanced for it, as there are
many true Princes, great and noble persons as give the same respect and homage
as if they were real Princes indeed and in truth


Then it if it were in my power I would divest those that had the right, and
true dignities, and titles, and put them upon those that only acted princely
and royal parts, since the Actors bear up so nobly, and the Spectators do creep
and crouch so basely: but indeed both sides are Actors, both the Spectators and
Players, only the one side Acts noble parts, the other side base parts, the one
Acts the parts of Princes, the other of Servants; but I am sorrow to see True
Honor wounded as it is


The truth of it is, True Honor lies a bleeding, and none does offer to power
in Balsimum


Faith Neighbor methinks a Queen is not such a brave and glorious thing as I
did imagine it


I will tell you truly Neighbor, that if I had thought a Queen had been no
finer a sight than this Queen is, I would have stayed in my house


And so would I, I tell you truly Neighbor.


I perceive Queens are no finer Creatures than other women are.


Lord what a ridiculous sight it is to see the Imaginary Queen act the part of
Majesty


Faith she is so far from Majesty, as she cannot act the part, for she appears
like a good Country Huswife


She is but a Gentlewoman, and that is all.


We may see the difference of true Greatness, and that which is forced, there
was the Queen Masculine; what a natural Majesty did she appear with? for all
she had given up her Crown and Kingdom, yet her Royal Birth was seen in her
Princely Carriage


It was a generous Act: But was it in her power to dispossess her self of her
natural Inheritance


It seems so; and it seems by her actions that she had rather see the World
abroad, than rule a Kingdom at home, for she has traveled most of all Europe
over


She appears to be a Royal Lady.


The Comical Duchess is brought to bed or the sweetest Princess that ever was
bore


Indeed it is the sweetest Princess that ever was born.


We are glad we hope her Highness will sleep well to night.


Pray present our most humble and obedient duty to her Highness.


Will you not go in and see her, and kiss the young Princesses hand?


If we may be so much honored, we shall be very proud of that Grace and Honor.


Come, come, we will prefer you to that Grace and Favor.


VVElcome Mistress Ink-pot, whether are you going so hastily?


Truly Mistress Paper, I am going to her Highness the Comical Duchess, for I
hear she is brought abed of a sweet young Princess


Is she so? I am glad her Highness pain is past, with all my heart.


So am I, for now we shall have Dancing again, as soon as her Month is past.


Yes, for she will send for us all, as soon as she is able to dance.


Yes that she will, and give us all Favors to wear for her sake.


But to some she gives her Picture too.


Yes, but those she gives her Picture too, are of a higher Degree.


By your favor, we are of as high a Degree as most that visit her.


Yes, of the female Sex, but not of the Masculine Sex; for there are great
Persons that visit her


Very few, but only of the Red Oker Nation, or some Strangers that are
Travelers, that visit her, as they pass other ways, else the men that visit
her, are of as inferior degree as we, as Fiddlers, Dancers, Players, and the
like


By your favor, there are sometimes Burgers and Gentlemen.


Yes sometimes, when she sends for to invite them to dance, or entreats them to
come and visit her; and then she presents them with her Colors


Lord, Madam, I was asked to day, why your Honor does not visit the Comical
Duchess, nor the Imaginary Queen


Why, should I that am Entitled with True Honor, and Princely Dignity, which
Titles were created from an Absolute and Divine Power, give place to mock
Honors, and feigned Dignities? shall Princes in Royal Courts, give place to
Princes in Plays


But every one does not rightly understand a Princely Dignity.


I will instruct you in the degrees of Princes, and their derivation; but
first, let me tell you, the Princely Arms, or Seal, is a Crown; for a Crown is
the General Arms, or Seal of all Princely Dignities, and every degree is known
and distinguished by the several fashions of their Crowns; for a Vicounts
Crown, which is the first degree of a Prince, is not like the Earls Crown,
which is the second degree; nor an Earls Crown is not like a Marquisses Crown,
which is the third degree; that is, t^ere is some difference in the Crown; nor
a Marquisses Crown is not like a Dukes Crown, which is the fourth degree; nor a
Dukes Crown is not like a close Imperial Crown, which is the last and highest
degree; that is, there is some difference in the Crown of each degree: Now
there are Absolute Princes, Tributary, and Subject Princes, but none can be
wholly called Absolute Princes, but those that have the Imperial Crown, which
are Absolute Kings and Emperors, being the only chosen of God, and by that the
only Creators of Titles; for they only are the Fountain, or Springs of Honor


How comes it that Subjects are made Princes?


By Adoption: for all Subject Princes are Princes by Adoption: that is, they
are adopted to their Princely Dignity, so that by Adoption, they are the Cosens
to Royalty, and are called by their Sovereigns, Kings Cosens, and are adorned
with Royal Robes, endued with Royal Power, and observed with Royal Ceremony,
and are allowed some Customs and Imposts out of the Revenue of the Kingdom, and
many privileges which belong to the Princely Dignities: Thus Kings call their
Subject Princes, Cosens, as being adopted to their Princely Royalty, like as
all Absolute Monarchs call each other Brother, as in relation to each others
Royalty: and being all of them Gods anointed, and appointed Deputies on Earth,
for Government and Honor, they are the sacred Magistrates of God, the divine
Fountains of Honor: Thus true Honor is derived from Heaven, and ought to be
respected, and bowed too, as being divine: but in this age Honor is used, or
abused, as other divine things are: this is the reason I will not visit the
Apocriphal Ladies: for my Honor is derived from the sacred Spring of Honor,
and is not a self-given Honor and Dignity, which ought to be punished as a
Presumption and Usurpation: but I have so much Honor, as not to abase the
Honor and Dignity that my Husband, and his Forefathers were adopted too: And
I by Marriage, being one with my Husband; for man and wife are but one, and my
Husbands Honor being Inhereditary, succeeds to his Children; wherefore his
Wife will never give place to Mountebanks


Indeed the strange ridiculousness, and folly, and mad presumption is, that the
Apocriphal Ladies take more State, or at least as much as sacred Royalty


But if Royalty will suffer such Heresies, and Heretics in the Court of
Honor, they are not to be lamented, if their Courts fall to utter ruin; for
it is with Titles and Dignities, as with Laws; if there were no Laws, there
would be no Government, and if there were no Degrees and dignities, there would
be no Royalty; so likewise if the Laws be corrupt and abused, Government will
fall to ruin, and if Honor be abused and usurpt, Royalty will fall from its
Throne; but howsoever, I keep up the Right of my place, because it is the cause
and interest of all the Nobility of my Country, so that if I should give place,
I should be a Traitor to true Honor, and dignified Persons


Well, now the Duke of Inconstancy has forsaken our Lady, his Comical
Duchess, all our State must down


Yes, and we must lose our places, in going before others, as being Dutchess's
women


The Duchess cried all night.


2. She had no more reason to cry, than she had, for the matter of Dignity;
for, pray consider, her Highness may keep the same State, as being Duchess
still, as well as she did before; for she possessed the Honor no more than she
does now, and so now no less than she did then

That is true, but the Duke did help to countenance her State, so long as he
did live with her, as a Husband, whereas now she will be hist off the Stage


Faith Confidence, and a Resolution will bear her up, wherefore let us persuade
her not to be daunted, or put out of countenance, and she having the same
Estate she had, may maintain her self as high as she has done


You say true, and the flanting show will dazzle the eyes, and delude the
understanding of the Spectators


Yes, of the Vulgar.


Honor goes a begging.


Why?


Why there is an Ale Wife made a Countess.


As how?


Why the Earl Undone has married Mistress Tip-tape.


But he has a Wife living.


That is all one, for did not the Duke of Inconstancy marry a Lady, and made
her a Duchess, although he had a Duchess to his Wife before, by whom he was a
Duke


I perceive Great Noble Persons may do what they will: for if a poor mean man
should have two Wives at one time, they would be surely punished; nay, in some
Kingdoms they would be hanged


DO you hear that the Duke of Inconstancy has forsaken his Comical Duchess?


Yes, but that is nothing.


Have you been with her Highness since?


Yes.


And how looks she upon her misfortunes?


Why she appears the same, and keeps greater State than ever she did; yea, even
her Children are served more royally than ever


Faith she is to be commended, if it will hold out.


As long as she has money, it will hold.


O, money does all things.


Noble Spectators,
IN Britain Land, long, long ago, I say,
There were such persons, as are in my Play;
In Chronicle you will find a story plain,
A Britain Queen that happily did Reign.
At last did marry one below her State,
Which merited not a Crown, or Kinly Fate;
Fos he, when Power got, did put away
His Royal Wife; and married, as they say,
Another Lady; She and he did live
Like lawful King and Queen, till God did give
The ronged Queen, her Kingdom back again;
For in a Battle, she her husband slain.
And of the rest, in Stories you shall read,
Such persons as my Play presents indeed.
