How now Jack, where have thou been?


A plague of all Cowards I say and a vengeance too, marry and amen; give me a
Cup of Sack Boy, no virtue extant, you Rogue; there is lime in this Sack too,
there is nothing but Roguery to be found in villainous Man, yet a Coward is
worse then a Cup of Sack with lime in it, a villainous Coward, go thy ways old
Jack, dye when thou will: if Manhood, good Manhood, be not forgot upon the
face of the Earth, then am I a shotten hearing: there lives not three good men
unhang'd in England, and one of them is fat and grows old: a bad World I say,
and a plague of all Cowards I say still


How now wool-sack, what mutter you?


A Kings Son? If I do not beat thee out of thy Kingdom with a Dagger of lath,
and drive all thy subjects before thee like a stock of wild-Geese, I Will never
wear hair on my face more, you Prince of Wales


Why you horson round man what is the matter?


Are you not a Coward? answer me to that, and Poines there.


Why ye fat paunch, and ye call me, Coward by this light, I Will stab thee.


I call thee Coward? I Will see thee damned e're I call thee Coward; but I would
give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou can. You are straight
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing
of your friends? a plague upon such backing: give me them that will face me,
give me a cup of Sack, I am a Rogue if I drank to day


Oh villain, thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drink'st last.


All Is one for that, a plague of all cowards still say I.


What Is the matter?


What Is the matter? here be four of us have taken a thousand pound this morning.


Where is it, I ask where is it.


Where is it? taken from us it is; a hundred upon poor four of us.


What a hundred man?


I am a Rogue if I were not at half Sword with a dozen of them two hours
together; I have escaped by miracle; I am eight times thrust through the
doublet, four through the hose, my Buckler cut through and through, my sword
hackt like a hansaw, ecce signum, I never dealt better since I was a man, all
would not do, a plague of all Cowards, let them speak, if they speak more or
less then truth, they are villains, and the sons of darkness


Speak Sirs, how was it.


We four set upon a douzen.


Sixteen at least my Lord.


And bound them.


No, no, they were not bound.


You rogue they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew else, an Hebrew
Jew


And as we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us.


And unbound the rest, and then came in the others.


What fought ye with them all?


All? I know not what you call all: but if I fought not with fifty of them, I
am a bunch of raddish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack, then I am no two-leg'd Creature


Pray God you have not murdered some of them.


Nay that is past praying for, I have peppered two of them; two Rogues in
buckrom suites: I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie spit in my face,
call me horse, thou know my old ward, here I lay, and thus I bore my point,
four Rogues in buckrom let drive at me


What four? thou said but two even now.


Four Hal, I told thee four.


I, I, he said four.


These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me; I made no more a do but
took all their seven points in my Target, thus. --


Seven? Why there were but four even now*


In Buckrum Hal, in Buckrum.


I four in Buckrum suits.


Seven by these Hilts, or I am a villain else.


Prithe let him alone, we shall have more anon*


Do thou hear me.


I, and mark thee too Jack.


Do so for it is worth the listening to. These nine in Buckrum that I told thee
off


So, two more already.


Their points being broken.


Down fell his Hose.


Began to give me ground, but I followed me close, came in foot and hand; and
with a thought seven of the eleven I paid


O Monstrous! eleven Buckrum men grown out of two.


But as the devil would have it, three mis-begotten knaves, in Kendal green,
came at my back and let drive at me, for it was so dark Hal that thou could
not see thy hand


These lies are like the father that begets, gross as a Mountain, open,
palpable, why thou clay-brain'd guts thou knotty pated fool, thou horson
obscent greasy tallow catch


What? art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth, the truth?


Why how could thou know these men in Kendall green, when it was so dark
thou could not see thy hand? what said thou to this


Come, your reason Jack, your reason.


What upon compulsion? and I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the
World, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion?
were reasons as plenty as Blackberries, I would give no Man a reason upon
compulsion, I


I Will be no longer guilty of this sin, this sanguine Coward, this Bed-presser,
this horseback breaker, this huge ^ill of flesh


You starvling, you Elf-skin, you dried Neats tongue, Bulls pizle, you stock
fish: O for breath to utter what is like thee? you Tailors yard, you sheath,
you Bow-case, you vile standing Turk


Hear me sirrah bumbast --


Mark Jack.


We two saw you four set upon four, bound them, and were Masters of their
wealth, then did we two set on you four, and with a word out-fac'd you from the
prize; what starting hole can thou now find out to hid thee from this open
and apparent shame


Come lets hear Jack, what trick have thou now?


By the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye, why hear you Masters, was it
for me to kill the heir apparent? should I turn up in the true Prince? why
thou know I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct, the Lion will
not touch the true Prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was a Coward on
instinct; I shall think the better of my self, and thee during my life; I for
a valiant Lion, and thou for a true Prince: but by the Lord Lads, I am glad you
have the money, Hostess clap to the doors, watch to night, pray tomorrow,
what hearts of Gold shall we be merry? shall we have a Play ex tempore


Content and the argument shall be thy running away.


O no more of that Hal if thou love me.


How longi'st ago Jack since thou saw thine own knee.


My own knee? when I was about thy years ( Hal) I was not an Eagles tallant in
the VVast: I could have crept into any Aldermans Thumb-Ring, a plague of
sighing and grief, it blows a man up like a Bladder; but to he Play Hal


I have a mind Jack that thou should stand for my father, and examine me upon
the perticulars of my life


Content: this Chair shall be my State, this dagger my Scepter, and this
Cushion my Crown. Well if the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shall
thou be moved, give me a cup of Sack to make mine eyes look red, that it may be
thought I have wept: For I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King
Cambysis vein


Well, here is my Leg.


And here is my speech: stand aside Nobility.


O the Father, how he holds his countenance, he does it as like one of these
harlotry players as ever Isee


Peace good pint Pot, peace good tickle branes. Harry I do not only marvel
where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied, thou art my
Son, I have partly thy Mothers word, partly my opinion, but chiefly a
villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy neither lip that
does warrant me. There is a thing Harry which thou have often heard off, and
known to many, in our Land, by the name of Pitch; this Pitch (as ancient
writers report) does defile, so does the company thou keep, yet there is one
virtuous Man whom I have noted in thy company, but I know not his name


What manner of Man, and it like your Majesty:


A good portly man in faith, and a corpulent, of a cheerful look, a pleasing
eye, and a most noble carriage, and as I think his age some fifty, or bir Lady,
inclining to threescore, and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that
man be lewdly given he deceives me, for Harry I see virtue in his looks; If
then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff, and now thou noughty
varlet, tell me where have thou been this month


Do thou speak like a King? do thou stand for me, and I Will play my father.


If thou do it so Majestically, ha^g me up by the heels for a Rabbet-sucker
or a Poulters Hare


Well here I am set.


And here I stand judge my Masters.


Now Harry whence come you?


My noble Lord from Eastcheap.


The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.


Zlud my Lord they are false: nay I Will tickle you for a young Prince.


Swear'st thou, ungracious Boy? henceforth n'ere look on me, thou art violently
carried away from grace; there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of a fat
old man, a Tun of man, is thy companion, why do thou converse with that
trunck of humors, that boulting-Butch of beastliness? that swollen parcel of
dropsies, that huge bombard of Sack, that stuff cloak bag of guts, that roasted
manning-tree Ox, with the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that gray
iniquity, wherein is he good but to taste Sack, and drink it? wherein neat and
cleanly, but to carve a Capon and eat it? wherein cunning but in craft? wherein
crafty but in villainy? wherein vallan^us but in all things? wherein Worthy but
in nothing


I would your grace would take me with you: who means your grace?


That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white bearded
satan


My Lord the man I know.


I know thou do.


But to say I know more harm in him then in my self, were to say more then I
know; that he is old, (the more the pity;) his white hairs do witness it: but
that he is (saving your reverence) a whoremaster, that I utter ly deny; if Sack
and Sugar be a fault, Heaven help the wicked: if to be old and merry be a sin,
then many an old Host that I know is damned; if to be fat, be to be hated, then
Pharaoh's lean Kine are to be beloved my good Lord: Banish Peto, banish Bardol,
banish Poynes; but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack
Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff; and therefore more valiant, being as he is old
Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company; banish plump Jack, and
banish all the World


I do. I will.


Oh my Lord the Sheriff with a monstrous watch is at the door.


Out you Rogue, play out the play, I have much to say in the behalf of that
Falstaff


Am I not fallen away vilely, do I not bate? do I not diminish? my skin hangs
about me like an old Ladies loose Gown, I am withered like an old apple John:
well I Will repent, and that suddenly I shall be out of heart shortly and then I
shall have no strength to repent, and I have not forgotten what the inside of a
Church is made of, I am a pepper-corn, villainous company has been the spoil
of me


Sir John you are so fretfull you cannot live long.


Why there is it, come sing me a bawdy song, make me merry, well I have been as
virtuously given as a Gentleman need to be, lived well and in good compass,
and now I live out of all order, out of all compass


Why you are so fat Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, all
reasonable compass Sir John


O mend thou thy face, and I Will mend my life: thou art our Admiral, thou
bear the Lanthorn in the poop, but it is in the Nose of thee, thou art the
King of the burning Lamp, when thou run'st up Gads Hill in the night to catch
my Horse if I did not think thou had been an Ignis fatuus or a ball of
wildfire, there is no purchase in money, O thou art a perpetual triumph, an
everlasting Bon-fire, by night


I would my face were in your belly.


God a mercy, so I should be heart-burnt. Now dame partlet the Hen, have you
inquired yet who picked my pocket


Why, Sir John do you think I keep thieves in my House Sir John.


I Will besworne my pocket was picked; go, you are a woman, go.


Who I? I defy thee: 'ods light I never was called so in my own House before,
you owe me money Sir John, I bought you a douzen shirts to your back


Dowlis, filthy Dowlis, I have given them away to Bakers Wives, they have made
boulters of them; I say my pocket was picked, I have lost a Seal-Ring of my
Grandfathers worth forty marks


Oh Lord I have heard the Prince tell him I know how often that Ring was Copper.


The Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cap, and he were here I would cudgel him like a
dog, if he would say so


Good my Lord hear me.


Prithee let her alone and list to me, this house is turned bawdy house, my
pocket has been picked here


And what did thou lose Jack?


If thou will believe me Hal, three or four Bonds of forty pounds a piece, and
a Seal-Ring of my Grandfathers


A trifle, some eight penny matter.


I told him you said so, and he said he would cudgel you.


What a' did not.


As I am a true woman he did.


Go you thing, go.


Say, what thing, what thing?


Why, a thing to thank God on.


I am nothing to thank God on, I would thou should know it.


Thou slander est her most grosely.


So he does you my Lord, he said the other day you ought him a thousand pound.


Sirrah do I owe you a thousand pound?


A thousand pound Hal? a million: thy love is worth a million: thou ow'st me
thy love


Nay, my Lord he called you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.


Did I Bardol?


Indeed Sir John, you said so.


Yea if he said my Ring was Copper.


I say it is Copper: dare thou be as good as thy word now?


Why Hal? thou know, as thou art but a man I dare: but as thou art Prince I
fear thee as I fear the roaring of the Lions Whelp


And why not as the Lion?


The King himself is to be feared as the Lion: do thou think I Will fear thee,
as I fear thy Father? nay, and I do, I pray my Girdle may break


If it should, how would thy Guts fall about thy knees.


Well I have misused the Kings press damnably, I have got in exchang of 150.
Soldiers 300. And od pound, I press none but warm slaves that had as lieve
hear the devil as a Drum, with hearts in their bellies no bigger then pins
heads, and they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge
consists of Ancients, Corporals, and the like: A mad fellow met me on the way,
and told me I had unloaded all the Gibbets, and pressed the dead bodies, there is
not a shirt and an half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins
tuckt together, and thrown over the shoulders like a Heralds coat without
sleeves; and the shirt, to speak truth on it, is stolen from my host at St.
Albanes, but that is all one, they*l find linen enough on every hedge


How now Q^ilt? tell me whose fellows are these that come after?


Mine Hal, mine.


I did never see such pittyfull Rascals.


Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder, they will fill a
pit as well as better: mortal men; mortal men, but I would all were well Hal


Why, thou ow'st a death.


It Is not due yet, and I would be loath to pay before the day, what need I be
so forward till I am called upon, well it is no matter, Honor pricks me on, yea
but how if Honor pricks me off when I come on? how then? can Honor set to a
leg? or an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no: Honor has no
skill in surgery then? no: what is Honor? a word: what is that word? Air: a
trym reckoning: who has it? he that dyed a wednesday: does he feel it? no:
does he hear it? No: it is insensible then? yea to the dead: but will it not
live with the living? No: why? detraction will not suffer it: therefore I Will
have none of it, Honor is a mere scutchion, and so ends my Catechism


What old acquaintance, could not all this flesh keep in a little life? poor
Jack farewell; imbowel'd will I see thee by and by, till then, in blood by
noble Percy lie


Imbowel'd? if thou imbowell me to day, I Will give you leave to powder me, and
eat me to morrow, Z'Bloud 'twas time to counterfeit, or the Termagant Scot had
paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I am no counterfeit: to die is to be a
counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a man, who has not the life of a
man; but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby lives, is to be no
counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed, the better part of
valor is destruction; in the which better part I have saved my life. -- I am
afraid of this Gunpowder Percy, though he be dead; how if he should counterfeit
too, and rise? by my faith I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit:
therefore I Will make him sure; yea and I Will swear I slew him, why may not he
rise as well as I? nothing confutes me but eyes, and no body sees me! therefore
sirrah with a new wound in your thigh, come you a long with me


What Is here? art thou alive? thou art not what thou seem sure.


No, that is certain, I am not a double man: but if I be not Jack Falstaff,
then I am a Jack: there is Percy, if your Father will do me any Honor, So: if
not, let him slay the next Percy himself: I look to be either Earl or Duke, I
can assure you


Why, Percy I slew my self, and saw thee dead.


Did thou? Lord, Lord, how the World is given to lying! I grant you I was
down, and out of breath, and so was he, but we rose at an instant, and fought
a long hour by Shrews busy Clock, if I may be believed, So: if not, let them
that should reward valor, bear the sin upon their own heads, I Will take it upon
my death I gave him this wound in the thigh, if the man were alive and would
deny it i would make him eat a piece of my sword


Come bring your luggage nobly on your back, for my part, if a lie will do thee
grace, I Will guild it with the happiest terms I have


I Will follow, as they say, for a reward: He that rewards me, God reward him, if
I do grow great, I Will grow less: for I Will purge and leave Sack, and live
cleanly, as a Noble man should do

Oh, no more shooting at that But.


SAve thy brave shoulder, my young puissant Knight, and may thy Backsword bite
Them to the bone, that love thee not, thou art an errant Man, go on, the
circumcised shall fall by thee. Let land and labor fill the Man that tills,
thy Sword must be thy Plow, and Jove it speed, Mecha shall sweat, and Mahomet
shall fall, and thy dear name fill up his Monument


It shall Captain, I mean to be a worthy.


One worthy is too little, thou shall be all.


Captain I shall deserve some of your love too.


Thou shall have heart and hand too, noble Morecraft, if thou will lend me
Money, I am a man of Garrison, be ruled, and open to me those infernal gates,
whence none of thy evil Angels pass again, and I will style thee noble, nay
Don Diego I Will woo thy Infaunta for thee, and my Knight shall feast her with
high meats, and make her apt


Pardone me Captain, you are beside my meaning.


No Mr. Morecraft it is the Captains meaning I should prepare her for ye.


Or provoke her. Speak my modern Man, I say provoke her.


Captain I say-so too, or stir her to it, so says the Critics.


However you expound it, she is welcome, come sit down, some wine here, there
is a scurvy banquet, if we had it. All this fair house is yours Sir; Savil


Yes Sir.


Are your keys ready, I must ease your burden.


I am ready to be undone Sir when you shall call me to it.


Come, come, thou shall live better.


I shall have less to do* that is all; there is half a dozen of my friends in the
fields Su^ning against a bank, with half a breech among 'um, I shall be with
'um shortly, the care and continual vexation of being rich, eat up this
raskal; what shall become of my poor family, they are no sheep, and they must
keep themselves


Drink Mr. Morecraft. Captain, speak loud and drink: Widow a word.


Expound her thoroughly Knight.

Here God a gold? here is to thy fair Possessions: Be a Baron, and a bold one;
leave off your tickling of young heirs like trouts, and let thy Chimnies smoke,
feed men O'war, live and be honest, and be saved yet


I thank you worthy Captain for your council, you keep your Chimnies smoking
there, your nostrils; and when you can, you feed a man of war, this makes you
not a Baron, but a bare one, and how or when you shall be saved, let the Clerk
o'th company (you have commanded) have a just care of


The man is much moved, Be not angry Sir, but as the Poet sings, let your
displeasure be a short fury, and go out. You have spoke hom^ and bitterly to me
Sir? Captain take truce, the Mi^er is a tart, and a witty whoreson


Poet, you fain perdie; the wit of this man lies in his fingers ends, he must
tell all; his tongue fills his mouth like a Neats tongue, and only serves to
lick his hungry chaps after a purchase: his Brains and brimstone are the
Devils diet to a fat Usurers head: to her Knight, to her: clap her aboard, and
stow her, where is the brave Steward


Here Is you poor friend, and Savil Sir.


Away thou art rich in Ornaments of nature, first in thy face, thou have a
serious face; a^etting, bargaining, and saving face, a rich face, pawn it to
the Usurer; a face to kindle the compassion of the most ignorant and frozen
Justice


It Is such I dare not show it shortly Sir.


Be blithe, and bo^ny Steward; Mr. Morecraft drink to this Man of reckoning?


Here Is even to him.


The devil guide it downward, would there were in it an acre of the great
Broomfeild, he bought; to sweep his durty conscience, or to choke you


Do but look on him, there is nothing in that hid-bound Usurer; that man of mat,
that al decayed but Arches: for you to love, unless his perished Lungs, his dry
Cough, or his scurvy; this is truth, and he has yet past cure of Physic, spaw,
or any diet, a primitive pox in his bones; and a' my knowledge he has been ten
times rowel'd; he had a bastard, his own towardly issue, whipped, and then cropped
for washing out the Roses, in three farthings to make 'um pence


I do not like these morals*


You must not like him then. By my troth Sir you are welcome.


I dare say he is glad at heart to see you.


This money must be paid again.


No Sir, pray keep the sale, 'twill make good Tailors measures:


I know not where I am, I am so glad; your worship is the welcom'st man alive;
upon my knees I bid you welcome home: here have been such a hurry, such a din,
such dismal drinking, swearing and whoreing, 'thas almost made me mad: We have
lived in a continual Turneball-street; Sir, blessed be Heaven, that sent you safe
again; now shall I eat, and go to bed again


What does that fellow tarry for?


Sir, to be Landlord of your House and state: I was bold to make a little sale
Sir


Am I over reached? if there be Law I Will hamper you.


Prithee be gone, eat redish till you raise your sums again, you are a stale
Cozener, leave my house: no more. --


A pox upon your house. Come Widow, I shall yet hamper this young Gamster.


Good twelve in the hundred, keep your way I am not for your diet, marry in
your own tribe Jew, and get a Broker


To you good Mr. Savil, and your office; thus much I have to say, you are from my
Steward become, first your own drunkard, then his Baud: they say you are
excellent grown in both, and perfect: give me your keys sir Savil. where is the
best drink now? where is the soundest Whores? Ye old he Goat, ye dried ape, ye
lame stallion, must you be leading in my House your Whores, like Fairies
dancing their night rounds, without fear either of King or Constable? Are all
my Hangings safe, my sheep unsold yet? I hope my Plate is Current, I ha'too
much on it. What say you to three hundred pounds in drink now


Good Sir for give me, and but hear me speak?


Methinks thou should be drunk still, and not speak, it is the more
pardonable


I will Sir, if you will have it so.


I thank ye. Yes, 'ene pursue it Sir; de'ye hear? Get you a Whore soon for your
recreation: go look out Captain broken-breech your fellow, and quarrel if you
dare; I shall deliver these keys to one shall have more honesty, though not so
much fine wit Sir; you may walk and gather cresses Sir, to cool your liver;
there is something for you to begin a diet, you will have the pox else; speed you
well Sir Savil: you may eat at my house to preserve life, but keep no
Fornication in the stables


Now must I hang my self, my friends will look for it. Eating and sleeping I do
despise you both now; I will run mad first, and if that get not pity, I Will
drown my self to a most dismal ditty


Alas poor Gentlewoman, to what a misery has age brought thee: to what a
scurvy fortune? Thou that have been a companion of Noblemen, and at the worst
of those times for Gentlemen: now like a broken Servingman, must beg for favor
to those that would have craul'd like pilgrims to thy chamber, but for an
apparition of me; you that be coming on, make much of fifteen, and so till five
and twenty, use your time with reverence that your profit may arise; it will
not tarry with you, Ecce signum: here was a face! but time, that like a
surfeit, eats our youth, plague of his Iron teeth, and draw 'um for it, has
been a little bolder here the^ welcome? and now to say the truth, I am fit for
no man, old men in the house of fifty call me Grannam; and when they are drunk,
e'ne then, when Ioane and my Lady are all one, not one will do me reason; my
little Levite has forsaken me, his silver sound of Cittern quite abollisht,
his doleful Hymns under my Chamber window, digested into tedious learning;
well fool, you leapt a haddock when you left him; he is a clean man, and a good
edifier, and twenty nobles in's estate de claro, besides his Pigs in posse, to
this good Homili^ I have been ever stubborn, which God forgive me for, and mend
my manners: and love if ever thou had care of forty, of such a piece of
lapland ground, hear my prayer, and fire his zeal so far forth, that my faults
in this renewed impression of my love, may show corrected to our Gentle Reader

See how negligently he passes by me? With what an Equipage canonical? As
though he had broken the heart of Bellarmine, or added something to the singing
brethren. It Is scorn, I know it and deserve it. -- Master Roger


Fair Gentlewoman, my name is Roger.


Then Gentle Roger.


Ungentle Abigal.


Why Mr. Roger, will you set your wit to a weak Woman's.


You are weak indeed, for so the Poet sings,


I confess my weakness sweet Sir Roger.


Good my Ladies Gentlewoman, or my good Ladies Gentlewoman (this trope is lost
to you now) leave your prating, you have a season of your first Mother in you;
and surely had the Devil been in love, he had been abused too: go Dalida, you
make men fools and wear fig Breeches


Well, well, hard hearted man; dilate upon the weak infirmities of Women; these
are fit Texts, but once there was a time; would I had never seen those eyes,
those eyes, those Orient eyes


I, they were pearls once with you.


Saving your reverence Sir, so they are still.


Nay, nay, I do beseech you leave your cogging, what they are, they are, they
serve me without spectacles I thank'um


O will you kill me?


I do not think I can, you are like a copy hold with nine lives in it.


You were wont to bear a Christian fear about you; For your own worships sake?


I was a Christian fool then: do you remember what a dance you led me? How I
grew qualm'd in love, and was a Dunce? Could expound but once a quarter, and
then was out too: and then out of the stinking stir you put me in, I prayed for
my own Royal issue, you do remember all this


O be as then you were.


I thank you for it, sure I will be wise Abigal; and as the Ethnic Poet sings,
I will not loose my Oil and labor too, you are for the Worshipful I take it
Abigal


O take it so, and then I am for you.


I like these tears well, and this humbling also; they are symptoms of
contrition; if I should fall into my fit again, would you not shake me into a
Quotidian Coxcombe; would you not use me scurvily again, and give me Possets
with purging comfits in it? I tell thee Gentlewoman, thou have been harder to me
then a long Pedigree


Oh Curate cure me; I will love thee better, dearer, longer; I will do any
thing, betray the secrets of the whole household to thy reformation, my Lady
shall look lovingly on thy learning, and when true time shall point thee for a
Parson, I will convert thy Eggs to penny Custards, and thy tithe Goose shall
grase and multiply


I am molifi'd, as well shall testify this faithful kiss, and have a great
care Mistress Abigall how you depress the spirit any more with your rebukes and
mocks: for certainly the edge of such a folly cuts its self


O Sir, you have peirst me through; here I vow a recantation to those malicious
faults I ever did against you, never more will I despise your learning, never
more pin Cards and Cunny tails upon your Cassock, never again reproach your
reverend Nightcap, and call it by the mangy name of murrin, never abuse your
reverend person more, and say you look like one of Baals Priests in the hangings,
never again when you say grace, laugh at you, nor put you out at prayers, never
cramp you more, nor when you ride get Soap and Thisles for you, no my Roger,
these faults shall be corrected and amended, as by the tenor of my tears
appears


Now cannot I hold if I should be hanged, I must cry too, come to thine own
beloved, and do even what thou will with me sweet, sweet Abigal. I am thi^e own
for ever, here is my hand, when Roger proves a recreant hang him in the
Bell-ropes


How now Roger, will no prayers go down with you.


Do but stay a little, I Will chop up prayers and be with you again.


But how these Sir, should live upon so little as Corn and Water, I am
unbeleiving


Why prithe sweet heart, what is your Ale? is not that corn and water, my sweet
Widow


I but my sweet Knight where is the meat to this, and clothes that they must
look for


In this short sentence Ale, is all included; meat, drink, and clothes; these
are no ravening Footmen, no fellows, that at Ordinaries dare eat their eighteen
pence thrice out before they rise, and yet go hungry to a play, and crack more
nuts then would suffice a dozen Squirils; besides the dinne, which is damnable:
These are people of such a clean discretion in their diet, of such a moderate
sustenance, that they sweat, if they but smell hot meat; pottage is poison,
they hate a Kitchen as they hate a Counter, and shew'um but a Feather-bed they
sound; Ale is their eating and their drinking surely, which keeps their bodies
clear, and soluble: Bread is a binder, and for that abolisht, 'ene in their
Ale, whose lost room fills an Apple, which is more air, and of a subtler nature.
The rest they take is little, and that little, is little ease, for like strict
men of Order, they correct their bodies with a Bench, or a poor stubborn Table;
if a Chimny offers it self with some few broken Rushes they are in Down; when
they are sick, that is drunk, if they may have fresh straw, else they do despise
these Worldly pamperings, for their poor apparel it is worn out to the diet;
new they seek none; and if a man should offer, they are angry; scarce to be
reconciled again with him: you shall not heare'um ask one cast Doublet once in
a year: which is modesty befitting my poor friends: you see their Wardrope,
though slender, competent: for shirts I take it, they are things worn out of
their remembrance, lowzy they will be when they list, and mangie, which shows a
fine variety; and then to cure'um a Tanners Lime-pit which is little charge, to
Dogs and these, these two may be cured for three pence


Use your pleasure Sir. Since I know your Diet Gentlemen, I Will take care that
meat shall not offend you, you shall have Ale


We ask no more, let it be mighty Lady; and if we perish, then our own sins on
us


COme Princes of the ragged Regiment, you of the blood, Prig my most upright
Lord, and these (what name or title e're they bear) Iarkman or Patrico,
Cranke, or Clapperdudgeon, Frater, or Abram-man; I speak to all that stand in
fair election for the title of King of Beggars, with the command adjoining,
Higgen your Orator, in this inter-Regnum, that Whilom was your Dommerer, does
beseech you all to stand fair, and put your selves in rank, that the first
comer may at his first view make a free choice to say up the question


It Is done Lord Higgen.


Thanks to Prince Prig, Prince Ferret. But where is Clause.


Behold the man. But pray my Masters all, Ferret be chosen, you are like to have
a merciful mild Prince of me


A very Tyrant, I, an arrant Tyrant. If e're I come to reign; therefore look
to it, except you do provide me Hum enough, and Lour to bouze with: I must have
my Capons and Turkies brought me in, with my green Geese, and Ducklings in the
season: fine fat Chickens, Or if you chance where an eye of tame Phesants or
Partridges are kept, see they be mine, or straight I seize on all your
privileges, places, revenues, offices, as forfeit, call in your crutches,
wooden legs, false bellies, forced eyes, and teeth, with your dead arms; nor
leave you a durty clout to beg with on your heads, or an old rag with butter,
frankinsense, brimstone and rozen, birdlime, blood, and cream to make you an
old sore: not so much soap as you may some with in the falling sickness; the very
bag you bear, and the brown dish shall be escheated, all your daintiest dells
too I will deflowre, and take your dearest Doxies from your warm sides; and
then some one cold night I Will watch you what old Barn you go to roust in, and
there I Will smother you all in the musty Hay


This is Tyrant like indeed: but what would Ginkes or Clause be here, if either
of them should reign


Best ask an Ass, if he were made a Camel, what he would be; or a Dog and he
were a Lion


I care not what you are, Sirs, I shall be a Beggar still, I am sure, find my
self there


O here a Judge comes.


Cry a Judge, a Judge.


What ayleyou ^irs? what means this outcry?


Master, a sort of poor souls met: Gods-fools, good Master, have had some
little variance amongst our selves who should be honestest of us; and which
uprightest in his call: now cause me thought we never should gree on it our
selves, because indeed it is hard to say; we all dissolved, to put it to whom
that should come next, and that is your Mastership, who I hope, will termine it
as your mind serves you, right, and no otherwise we ask it: which? which does
your worship think is he? sweet Master look over us all, and tell us; we are
seven of us, like to the seven wise Masters, or the Planets


I should judge this the man with the grave beard, and if he be not, --


Bless you good Master, bless you.


I would he were: there is something too amongst you to keep you all honest.


King of Heaven go with you.


Now God reward him, may he never want it* to comfort still the poor in a good
hour


What is it? see; Snap has got it.


A good Crown marry:


A crown of Gold.


For our new King; good luck.


To the common treasury with it; if it be Gold thither it must.


Spoke like a Patriot, Ferret --

King Clause, I bid God save the first, first, Clause, after this golden token
of a Crown; where is Orator Higgen with his gratuling speech now in all our
names


Here he is pumping for it.


H'has cough'd the second time, it is but once more and then it comes.


So, out withal; expect now --


That thou art chosen venerable Clause, our King and Sovereign; Monarch o'th
Maunders, thus we throw up our Nab-cheats, first for joy, and then our filches;
last we clap our fambles, three subject signs, we do it without envy: for who
is he here did not wish thee chosen, now thou art chosen? ask 'um: all will say
so, nay swear't, it is for the King, but let that pass; when last in conference
at the bouzing Ken this other day we sat about our dead Prince of famous
memory: (rest, go with his rags:) and that I saw thee at the Tables end, rise
moved, and gravely leaning on one Crutch, lift the other like a Scepter at my
head, I then presaged thou shortly would be King, and now thou art so: but
what needs presage to us, that might have read it in thy beard: Oh happy beard:
but happier Prince whose beard was so remarked, as marked out our Prince, not
baiting us a hair. Long may it grow, and thick and fair, that who lives under
it, may live as safe, as under Beggars-Bush, of which this is the thing, that
but the Type


Excellent, excellent Orator, forward good Higgen, give him leave to spit: the
fine, well spoken Higgen


This is the beard, the bush, or bushy-beard under whose Gold and Silver reign
'twas said so many ages since, we all should smile on impositions, taxes,
grievances, knots in a State, and whips unto a subject, lie lurking in his
beard, but all kem'd out: if now the Beard be such, what is the Prince that
owes the Beard? a father; no, a Grandfather; nay the great Grandfather of you
his people. He will not force away your Hens, your Bacon, when you have
ventured hard for it, nor take from you the fattest of your puddings: under him
each Man shall eat his own stolen Eggs and Butter, in his own shade, or Sun
shine, and enjoy his own dear Dell, Doxy, or Mort, at night in his own straw,
with his own shirt, or sheet, that he has filtch'd that day, I, and possess
what he can purchase, back, or belly-cheats, to his own prop: he will have no
purveyors for Pigs, and Poultry


That we must have, my Learned Orator, it is our will, and every man to keep
in his own Path and Circuit


Do you hear.

You must hereafter maundon your own pads he says.


And what they get there, is their own, besides to give good words.


Do you mark? to cut Bene-whids, that is the second Law.


And keep a foot the humble, and the common phrase of begging, least men
discover us


Yes: and cry sometimes to move compassion; Sir, there is a Table, that does
command all these things, and enjoynes 'em; be perfect in their Crutches: their
feigned Plasters, and their true passe-bords, with the ways to stammer, and to
be dumb, and deaf, and blind, and lame, There, all the halting paces are set
down, in the learned Language


Thither I refer them, those, you at leisure shall interpret to them, we love
no heaps of Laws, where few will serve


O gracious Prince, 'save the good King Clause.


A song to Crown him.


Set a Centinell out first.


The word?


A cove comes. and fumbumbis to it -- strike Which ended.


A Cove; Fumbumbis.


To your postures; Arm.


Yonder Is the Town; I see it.


There Is our danger indeed before us, if our shadows save not.


Bless your good worships.


One small piece of money.


Amongst us all poor wretches.


Blind and lame.


For his sake that gives all.


Pitiful worships.


One little doit.


King, by your leave, where are you?


To buy a little bread.


To feed so many mouths as will ever pray for you.


Here be seven of us.


Seven, good Master, O remember seven, seven blessings.


Remember, gentle Worshipful.


Against seven deadly sins.


And seven sleepers.


If they be hard of heart, and will give nothing -- alas we had not a charity
this three days


Heaven reward you.


Lord reward you.


The Prince of pity bless thee.


Do I see? or is it my fancy that would have it so? ha? it is her face; come
hither Maid


What have you Bells for ^y Squirrel? I have given Bun meat, you do not love me
do you? catch me a Butterfly, and I Will love you again; when? can you tell?
Peace, we go a birding; I shall have a fine thing


Her voice too says the same; but for my head I would not that her manners
were so changed, hear me thou honest fellow; what is this Maiden that lives
amongst you here


Ao, ao, ao, ao.


How? nothing but signs?


Ao, ao, ao, ao.


It Is strange, I would fain have it her, but not her thus.


He is de -- de -- de -- de -- de -- de -- deaf, and du -- du -- du --
dude-dumb sir


'Slid they did al speak plain even now me thought, do thou know this same
Maid


Why, why, why, why, which, gu, gu, gu, gu, Gods fool she was bo -- bo -- bo --
bo -- born at the Barn yonder by be -- be -- be -- be -- Beggars Bush, bo -- bo
-- Bush, her name is My -- my -- my -- my -- Match; so was her Mo -- Mo --
Mothers too too


I understand no word he says; how long has she been here?


lo -- lo -- long enough to be in -- in -- ingled; and she ha go -- go -- go --
good luc


I must be better informed, then by this way. here was another face to that I
marked, Oh the old man's but they are vanished all most suddenly; I will come
here again, Oh that I were so happy, as to find it, what I yet hope? It is put
on


The Coast is clear, Ferret, I bo -- bo -- bo -- 'd hence.


I, thou were at thy ba, be, by, bo, bu, which showed thou were a Scholar.


He durst not hold discourse with me, so much for the credit of the Snaps, as
the word says, either Snap some, or Snap all. That is if you cannnot Snap all,
Snap some


But thy snaping too short makes thee so lean, I think I have ferreted you
there Snap


We shall not get a snap if we prate longer, our King is served by this time,
Dish, and bit, the Feast waits no man, but the man waits it


That is an eager stomach Snap; here I Ferret you again.


So rich, and I his sole Executor.


Very right Sir, I am to make his will, will you come near Sir.


I am sorry neighbor to find you in so weak a State.


Ye are welcome, but I am fleeting, Sir.


Methinks he looks well, his color fresh and, strong, his eyes are cheerful.


A glimering before death Sir, it is nothing else; do you see how he fumbles with
the sheets


My learned Sir pray ye sit, I am bold to send for you to take a care of what I
leave. --


Do you hear that?


My honest neighbors weep not, I must leave ye, I cannot always bear ye
company, we must drop still, there is no remedy: pray ye Mr. Parson will ye
write my Testament, and write it largly, it may be remembered, and be witness to
my legacies good Gentlemen: your worship I do make my full Executor, you are a
man of wit and understanding: give me a cup of Wine to raise my spirits, for I
speak low: I would, before these neighbors, have you to swear, (Sir) that you
will see it executed; and what I give, let equally be rendered for my Souls
health


I vow it truly neighbors, let not that trouble ye, before all these, once
more I give my Oath


Then set me higher, and pray you come near me all.


We are ready for you.


First then, after I have given my Body to the Worms: (for they must be served
first, they are seldom cozened.


Remember your parish Neighbor.


You speak truly, I do remember it, a vile lewd Parish, and pray it may be
mended: To the poor of it (which is to all the Parish) I give nothing, for
nothing unto nothing is most natural, yet leave as much space as will build an
Hospital, their children may pray for me


What do you give to it?


Set down two thousand Ducats: To your Worship; (because you must take pains
to see all finished) I give two thousand more, it may be three Sir, a poor
gratuity for your paines-taking


These are large sums?


Nothing to him that has 'em.


To my old Master I give five hundred, (five hundred and five hundred are too
few Sir) but there are more to serve


This fellow Coins sure.


Give me some more drink, Pray ye buy Books, buy books, you have a learned head
stuff it with libraries, and understand 'em when ye have done, it is justice,
run not the parish mad with controversies, nor preach not as abstinence to
longing women, 'twill purdge the bottom of their consciences: I would give the
Church new Organs, but I prophecy the Churchwardens would quickly pipe 'em
out 'oth parish, two hundred Ducats more to mend the Chancell, and to paint
true Orthography as many, They write Sunt with a C which is abominable, pray
you set that down to poor maids Marriages


I that is well thought of, what is your will in that point? A merritorious thing.


I give per annum two hundred Else of Lockram that there be no straight
dealings in their Linnens, but the sails cut according to their burdens; to
all Bell-ringers, I bequeath new Ropes, and let them use them at their own
discretions


You may remember us Sir.


I do, good Gentlemen, and I bequeath you both good careful Surgeons a legacy,
you have need of more then Money, I know you want good dyets and good lotions*
and in your pleasures good take heed


He raves now, but 'twill be quickly off.


I do bequeath ye commodities of thy pins: brown papers: Pack-threads, roast
Porke and puddings: Ginger-bread and Jews trumps of penny pipes, and moldy
pepper: take 'um even where you please and be cozened with 'em, I should
bequeath my Executours also, but those I Will leave to the Law


Now he grows temperate.


You Will give no more.


I am loath to give more from ye, because I know you will have a care to
execute, only to pious uses, Sir a little


If he be worth all these, I am made for ever.


I give to fatal Dames that spin men's thredsout, and poor distressed Damsells
that are militant, as members of our own afflictions, a hundred crowns to buy
warm Tubs to work in, I give five hundred pounds to buy a Church yard, a
spacious Church yard, to lay thieves and knaves in, rich men and honest men
take all the room up


Are you not weary?


Never of well doing.


These are mad Legacies.


They were got as madly, my sheep and oxen, and my movables, my Plate and
Jewels and five hundred acres; I have no heirs


This cannot be, it is monstrous.


Three Ships at Sea too.


You have made me full Executor?


Full, full, and total, would I had more to give ye, but these may serve an
honest mind


You say true, a very honest mind, and make him rich too; But where shall I
raise these moneys, where shall I find these sums


Even where ye please Sir, you are wise and provident, and know business, even
raise 'em where you shall think good, I am reasonable


Think good? will that raise thousands?


You have sworn to see it done that is all my comfort.


Where I please? this is packed sure to disgrace me.


Ye are just and honest, and I know ye will do it, e'ne where you please, for
you know where the wealth is


I am abused, ^baffl'd and boared it seems.


No, ye are fooled.


Most finely fooled.


Ha, ha, ha, some more drink, for my heart, Gentlemen this merry Lawyer -- Ha,
ha, ha this Scholar -- I think this fit will cure me: this Executor -- I shall
laugh out my lungs


This is dirision above sufferance.


Did you think, had this Man been rich, he would have chosen a Wolf, a
Cancker, a Maggot-pate to be his whole Executor


A Lawyer that intangles all men's honesties, and lives like a Spider in a
cob-web, lurking, and catching at all flies, that pass his Pit falls? Puts
powder to all States, to make 'em caper? would he trust you


Do you deserve? I find Gentlemen this Cataplasme of a well cozened Lawyer laid
to my Stomach lenifies my fever, Methink I could eat now and walk a little


I am ashamed to see how flat I am cheated, how grosely, and maliciously made a
May Game


This it is to covet all the gains, to have a stirring Oar in all men's actions.


We did this but to vex your fine officiousies.


I thank ye, I am fooled Gentlemen; the Lawyer is an Ass, I do confess it, a
weak, dull, shallow Ass, good even to your Worships: Vicar, remember Vicar,
Rascal remember, thou notable rich Rascal


I do remember Sir, pray ye stay a little, I have even two Legacies more to
make your mouth up, Sir


Remember Varlets, quake and remember Rogues, I have brine for your Buttocks.


Oh, how he frets and fumes now like a dunghill.


His Gall contains fine stuff now to make poisons, rare damned stuff.


Go, let us us crucify him.


Dead, dead, they are no doubt on it, and I Heir apparent to the port-ma^tue,
an aglet hole or two in their hearts has done the business, the port-mantue, I
say bring forth the port-mantue


It Is here Sir.


And thy Father too Boy?


What would you have, it is very late?


Never too late to tell Money, fetch me a brace of Gennets, I will mount 'em, a
Covey of Curtisans, do here


What does the fellow mean?


No fellows friend on thy allegiance, it is time to show our self, where is thy
Boy


Here Seignior.


Kneel down, and ask me blessing.


This does look like a blessing, shall I ask another?


Ask any thing but what I am, I must be still disguised, my Men are absent.


Your men? --


Thou art wise, thine ear, I am a Prince, the reason of my shape thou shall
know hereafter, thus Jove has been disguised


Is not your name Pimponio.


It was my pleasure they should call me so, I have not found 'em trusty, how
fares the Duchess? Boy thou shall wait on me, I Will have you all


Whether?


To Spain, when thou have got a chapman for this tub thou liv'st in, let me
know it


Where Is Pimponio?


A pox pimp you, they are alive again, now am I a dead man.


There is a certain moveable, ecclip'd a portmantue.


Would your tongue had been clipped.


With your pardon Sir, is not this Seignior a Prince disguised, and came hither
to Court the Duchess? he has promised us at his return from Spain to make us
grandees


Has he betrayed himself? nay then my duty; if please your excellence.


Away, away.


A Prince cannot be hid* though under Mountains, but my dear Prince the bags
must go with me, while you keep State 'ith Inn


Who shall maintain.


If I did think thou would carry it handsomely -- well I Will excuse thee to
thy Master, when thou have domineered away this Bag, thou may hear more, and
so I take leave of your excellence


Hah, am not I a Prince indeed? Grutti, Boy, I entertain you both my Groom, and
Page, and say unto you, Snakes go cast your coats, here is earnest for new
skins, when things are ripe we will to Court


What thinks your Grace of going to bed.


I am too sober, let the whole house be drunk first, let me have fifty
Strumpets


Fifty Trumpets.


Strumpets I say, they will make the greater noise, this Roome's too narrow, beat
down the walls on both sides, advance your light, and call the country in, if
there be a Tailor amongst 'em, he shall first take measure of my highness, for
I must not longer walk in Querp


We attend your Highness.


Why I shall hardly take thee for my own natural child.


Let me alone with my Don, he is gone to fit himself with clothes, and if I do
not fit him, let me never find the way into my own breeches, see he has had a
nimble Tailor, some Suit prepared to his hand, I know my cue to enter, and
pursue his Princely humor out of breath


And how, and how do things become? We were in clouds but now.


Your Highness is broken out.


Broken out, where?


Out of the clouds and please you.


There is no Infidel among you then, you all believe I am a Prince, there are
no Traitors I hope amongst ye


Traitors we will cut off any man's neck, that dares but think so.


Do and I will justify it, hang necks among friends, let us be merry, reach me
a Chair and a bottle of Wine, every one take his charge


Will not your Highness have the dance first.


They will dance the better when they are three quarters drunk, music and give
fire at once -- so, but methings it were necessary there were some difference
in our drinking; all are not Princes, reach me a bigger bottle, I will preserve
my state, This is a Princely draught -- so -- why have we not a concubine


Brave Prince with what a Majesty he drinks.


Now let 'em friske the dance you have prepared, we are ready to accept it.


And it shall please your Grace there is a high German desires to speak with
you


I fear you are betrayed Sir, and that the Duchess has sent for you.


For me, I won not come yet,


Do not affront him Sir for your own sake, this high German has beaten all the
Fencers in Europe


Let him beat all the World, what is that to me? shall he make a Prize of me?


But if he come Ambassador from the Duchess.


That Is an other matter, give me the the other bottle -- now let all the Cantons
of Scorss come -- which is the high German? let me see him


That Sir.


He Is one of the lowest high Germans that e're I looked on.


I kiss thy highness hand.


And we embrace thy Lownes: do you hear Sir, are you a high German?


I was so at the beginning of the wars, what we are beaten to you may discern.


Are you beaten to this? you will be a very little Nation if the wars continue.


I have a message to deliver you, the fair Duchess of Urbin, whom I wait on,
hearing a person of your blood and quality, so meanly lodged, by me, desires
you would accept an entertainment in her Court


We give the Duchess thanks: But what High German in thy little judgment,
do think the Duchess will do with me there


'Twere sin to say she will honor you, for you are above all addition, but her
love, it is probable you may be affronted


No matter, I have been affronted a hundred times, but by whom?


Questionless by some great ones, and perhaps beaten.


I have been beaten too upon good occasion, and will again to save my Honor,
beaten? I can take the strappado, beside in this part I am insensible, a Kick
is cast away


If you be valient and endure, it will engage her love the more, go on boldly,
my council shall attend


I will go on, and fear no beating; well I cannot Knight thee, yet prove but a
witch, I Will make thee one of my privy Counselors


Tara, Ra ra ra, room for the Duke of Ferrara.


What Is the matter.


You have fooled finely, you must be whipped, and stripped, my scurvy Don.


Whip a Prince? what do you mean?


You must be Duke of Ferrara*


Duke of a Fidle-stick, are you in earnest Gentlemen? do you intend I shall
catch an Ague Gentlemen


The lash, when the fit comes, will keep you warm, stay but a little, and we will
send you a whip to comfort you


'Twill be but cold comfort, make the best on it; how am I transformed? where is
my low high German now? Duke of Ferrara quoth a': -- would I were any thing, I
know not what I am, as they have handled me


Is the Duke gone?


Yes Madam.


I Will have the fool hanged then.


That Is I.


Alas poor fellow, Ha, ha, ha, what art thou?


Nothing, I hope she does not know me again, I must deny my self.


Come hither sirrah, whose devise was it to bid you say you were Duke of
Ferrara


Alas not I Madam, he is gone.


Who is gone?


The insolent fellow that made a fool of your Highness.


Whether is he gone?


To obey your Grace, and be whipped.


Why do you shake so?


I Am very warm and please your Grace.


Where Is your Clothiers.


My Clothes? I never wore any more in my life, I sweat with these.


Alas poor fellow, he has punishment enough, who waits there.


Now to be sent to whipping cheer.


Bid Borgia attend us.


I shall Madam.


How now sirrah, what are you?


A tumbler; do you not know me?


I know thee?


What not Pimponio honest Pimponio.


Seignior Borgia her Grace calls for you.


I attend.


How Seignior Borgia? then I am not I. And there is no staying here to find my
self, as I remember some back friends of mine did promise a clean whipped, I Will
rather endure the foulness of the weather then stay for it, I must be dukifi'd,
be persuaded into Kicks -- they will return I won not tempt my desteny, she
promised to hang me, and I can do that for my self when I have a mind to it


Kick that fellow out of the Court.


You are mistaken Sir, he means some body else, I have been kicked already,

Oh gentle fate rid me out of their clutches:
And then adue to our picked-dame Duchess.

What Is the matter*


A fool has lost his Master, and thus cries him about the Court thy man Aurelio.


Oh Yes;

If any Man there be
In Town or in Country
Can tell me of a wight,
Was lost but yester Night:
His name was I know
Seignior Aurelio,
Bring word to the Crier
His desolate Squire,
By these marks, he is known
He had a bush of his own,
Two eyes in their place,
And a Nose on his face,
His Beard is very thin,
But no hair on his Chin,
And for this fine feat
Take what you can get;
And heaven bless Pimponio, for no body knows me and I know no body else to
pray for


Here, here is thy Master.


No, no, that is Seignior Borgia, not a word of whiping if you love me, do not
deceive your self


We have been both deceived, Pimponio I am thy master.


Why then I Will wander through an other World with you, a World that has more
charity in it, then to uncase a man for doing his master Honor


Shall I never return to my own house again? we are lodged here in the
miserablest Doghole, a conjurers circle gives content above it, a Hawks mew is
a Princly palace to it we have a bed no bigger then a basket, and there we lie
like Butter clapped together, and sweat our selves to sauce immediately, the fumes
are infinite inhabit here too; and to that so thick they cut like Marmalet, so
various too, they will pose a Gold finder. Never return to mine own paradise? why
wife I say, why Estifania


Within. I am coming presently.


Make have good Jewel; I am like the people that live in the sweet Islands: I
dye, I dye, if I stay but one day more here, my lungs are rotten with the damps
that rise, and I cough nothing now but stinkes of all sorts; the Inhabitants
we have, are two starved Rats, for they are not able to maintain a Cat here,
and those appear as fearful as two Devils, they have eat a map of the whole
World up already, and if we stay a night longer we are gone for company,
There Is an old woman that is now grown to Marble, dried in this Brick hill, she
sits 'ith Chimnies, which is but three tyles raised like a house of Cards, the
true proportion of an old smok'd hovill, there is a young thing too, that is
nature meant for a Maid servant, but it is now a monster, she has a husk about
her like a Chestnut, with lasiness, and liveing under the line here, and these
two make a hollow sound together, like Frogs or winds between two Doors that
murmurs, mercy deliver me, O are you come wife! Shall we be free again


I am now going, and you shall presently to your own house Sir, by that time
you have said your Orisons, and broke your fast, I shall be back and ready to
usher you to your old content, your freedom


Break my neck rather, is there any thing here to eat but one another like a
race of Canniballs, a piece of buttered wall you think is excellent, let us have
our house again, immediately, and pray ye take heed unto the Furniture, none be
imbezelled


Not a pin I warrant you.


And let 'em instantly depart.


They shall both, for by this time she has acquainted him, and will give over
gratefully unto you


I Will walk 'ith churchyard, the dead cannot offend me more then these living,
an hour hence I Will expect you


I Will not fail Sir.


And do ye hear, lets have a handsome dinner, and let me have a strong Bath to
restore me, I stink lik a stall-fish-shambles, or an Oyle-shop


You shall have all; which some interpret nothing.


Nay, pray ye come out, and let me understand ye, and tune your Pipe a little
higher Lady, i will hold ye fast


Ha, what would you have?


My goods again, how came my trunks all open.


Are your Trunks gone?


Yes, and clothes gone, and Chains, and Jewels, how she smells like hung
Beef, the palsy and picklocks, fie how she belches the spirit of Garlic


Where Is your Gentlewoman? the young fair Woman?


What Is that to my question? she is my Wife, and gone about my business.


Is she your Wife Sir?


Yes Sir, Is that wonder, is the name of Wife unknown here.


Is she truly, truly your Wife?


I think so, for I married her, it was no vision sure.


If you be married to that Gentlewoman you are a wretched man, she has twenty
husbands


She tells you true.


And she has cozened all Sir.


The devil she has, I had a fair house with her that stands hard by, and
furnished Royally


You are cozened too, it is none of hers, good Gentleman, It is a Ladies,
what is the Ladies name wench


The Lady Margarita, she was her servant, and kept the house, but going from
her Sir, for some lewd tricks she played


Plague a'the devil, Am I 'ith Meridian of my wisdom cheated by a stale
Queen? what kind of Lady is that, that owes the house


A young sweet Lady.


Of a low stature?


She is indeed of a low stature, but wondrous fair.


I feel I am cozened, sensible I am undone, was she her Mistress say you?


Her own Mistress, her very Mistress Sir, and all you saw about that house was
hers


No plate, no Jewels, nor no hangings? No Money?


She is a poor shifting thing, but for one Gown her Lady gave her.


I am mad now, I think I am as poor as she, I am wild else, one civil suit I
have left, and that is all, if she steal that she must flea me for it, where
does she use


You may find truth as soon, alas a thousand concealed corners Sir she lurkes
in, and here she gets a fleese, and there another, and lives in mists and
smokes where none can find her


Is she a whore too?


Little better Gentleman, I dare not say she is so, she is yours.


A Whore and a Theife too, two excellent moral virtue, in one she is Saint, I
hope to see her legend, well here is a Royal left yet, there is for your lodging
and your meat for this week; a Silk-worme lives at a more plentyfull ordinary,
and sleeps in a sweeter Box, Farewell great Grandmother, if I do find you were
an accessory, it is but cuting off two smoaky minutes, I Will hang you presently


It Is he, I am caught, I must stand to it stoutly.


It is my evil Angel, let me bless me; my worthy wife?


My most noble Husband.


I have been in bawdy houses.


I believe you, and very lately too.


To seek your Ladyship, in Cellers too, in private Cellers where the thirsty
bawds hear your confessions, I was among the Nuns because you sing well, but
they say yours are bawdy songs, they mourn for ye, and last I went to Church
to seek you out, it is so long since you were there, they have forgot you


You have had a merry progress, I Will tell nine now, I went to twenty Taverns.


And are you sober.


Yes, I reel not yet sir, where I saw twenty drunk, most of them Soldiers,
from thence to the Diceing-house, there I found quarrels needless, and
senseless, Swords, and Pots, and Candlesticks, Tables, and Stools, and all in
one confusion; then to the Chyrurgions went, who learnedly told me, if you
tippl'd hard twenty to one you whor'd too, and then he should hear of you; last
to your Confessor I came who told me you were too proud to pray, and here I
have found ye


She bears up bravely, and the Rogue is witty, why am I cozened, why am I
abused? Thou most vile, base, abominable


Captain.


Thou stinking, overstew'd, poor, pocky.


Captain.


Do You echo me.


Yes sir, and go before you too, you had best now draw your Sword Captain, draw
it, upon a Woman, do brave Captain, upon your Wife, oh most renowned Captain


A plague upon thee, why did thou marry me?


To be my Husband.


Why did thou flatter me, and show me wonders, a House and riches? when they
are but shadows, shadows to me


Why did you work on me with your strong Soldiers wit, and swore you would
bring me so much in Chains? so much in Jewels Husband, and here is your
Treasure, sell it to a Tinker to mend old ^ettles; is this noble usage


A Fire subtle you, are ye so crafty?


Here Is a goodly Jewel, did not you win this at G^lletta Captain, or took it in
the Field from some brave Bashaw? how it sparkles like an old Ladies eyes? and
fills each Room with Light like a Dark-lanthorn, this would do rarely in an Abbey
Window, to cousen Pilgrims


Prithe leave prating.


And here is a Chain of Whitings-eyes for Pearls, a Mussel-monger would have
made a better


Nay, prithe Wife, my Clothes, my Clothes.


I Will tell ye, your Clothes are parallels to these all counterfeit, put these
and them on, you are a Man of Copper, a kind of Candlestick, these you thought,
my Husband to have cozened me withal, but I am quit with you


Is there no House then, nor no ground about it, no Plate, nor Hangings.


There are none sweet Husband; shadow for shadow is an equal; justice, can you
rail now? pray put your fury up sir, and speak great words, you are a
Soldier, Thunder


I will speak little, I have played the fool, and so I am rewarded.


You have spoken well sir.


Shall I never see a lusty Man again.


Faith Mistress, you do so over-labour 'em, and so dryfounder 'em, they cannot
last


Where Is the Frenchman?


Alas, he is all to fitters, and lies taking the height of his fortune with a
Sirrenger, he is chin'd, he is chin'd good Man, he is a mourner


What Is become of the Don?


Who? gold Locks? he is foul in the Touchhole: and recoiles again, the main
Springs weakened that holds up his Cock, he lies at the sign of the Sun to be
new breech'd


The Rutter too is gone.


Oh, that was a brave Rascal, he would labor like a Thresher; but alas what
thing can ever last? he has been ill-mew'd, and drawn too soon; I have seen him
in the Hospital


There was an Englishman. --


I, there was an Englishman; you will scant find any now to make that name good.
There was those Englishmen, that were Men indeed, but they are vanished: They
are so taken up in their own Country, and so beaten off their speed by their
own Women, when they come here they draw their Legs like Hackneys, drink,
and their own devices have undone 'em


I must have one that's strong, no life in Lisbon else, perfect and young; my
custom with young Ladies and high fed Citty-Dames will fall and break else, I
want my self too in my age to nourish me; They are all sunck I maintained, now
what is this business? what goodly fellows that


Why do you drag me? Pox on your Justice, let me loose, cannot a Man fall into
one of your drunken Cellars, and venture the breaking on's Neck, but he must be
used thus rascally


What made you wandering so late in the night? you know that is imprisonment.


May be I walk in my sleep.


What made you wandering sir, into that Vault where all the City store and the
Ammunition lay


I fell into it by chance, I broke my shins for it, your Worships feel not that;
I knocked my Head against a hundred Posts, would you had had it, cannot I break
my Neck in my own defense


Your coming thither was to play the Villain, to fire the Powder and blow up
that part o'th City


Yes, with my Nose.


We have told you what is the Law, he that is taken there, unless a Magistrate,
and have command in that place, presently if there be nothing found appa^ent,
near him worthy his Torture, or his present death, must either pay his Fine for
his presumption, (which is six hundred Ducats) or for six years tug at an
Oa^e in the Galleys; may be you were drunk, you will be kept sober there


Tug at an Oar, you are not errant Rascals to catch me in a Pit fall and
betray me


A lusty-minded Man.


O, wondrous able.


Pray Gentlemen allow me but that liberty to speak a few words with your
Prisoner, and I shall thank you


Take your pleasure Lady.


What would you give that Woman should redeem you, redeem you from this slavery.


Besides my service, I would give her my whole self, I would be her Vassal.


She has great reason to expect as much, considering the great sum she pays
for it, yet take comfort, what you shall do to merit this, is easy, and I will
be the Woman shall befriend you, It Is but to entertain some handsome Ladies,
and young fair Gentlewomen; you guess the way; but -- giving of your mind --


I am excellent at it, you cannot pick out such another living; I understand
you, is it not thus? * --


Ye have it.


Bring me a hundred of 'em, I Will dispatch 'em, I will be none but yours; should
another offer another way to redeem me, I should scorn it, what Women you shall
please; I am monstrous lusty, not to be taken down; would you have Children?
I Will get you those as ^ast, and thick as fly-blowes


I admire him, wonder at him.


Hark you Lady, you may require some times. --


I by my faith.


And you have it by my faith and handsomely; this old Cat will suck shrewdly;
you have no Daughter? I fly at all; now I am in my Kingdom, Tug at an Oar? no,
tug in a Feather-bed with good warm Caudles; hang your bred and water, I Will
make you young again, believe that Lady; I will so frubbish you


Come fellow Officers, this Gentleman is free; I Will pay the Ducats.


And when you catch me in your Citty-powdering Tub again, boil me with
Cabbidge


You are borh warned and armed Sir.


Now do I look as if I were Crow-trodden, fie, how my hams shrink under me; O
me, I am brokenwinded too; Is this a life? Is this the recreation I have aimed
at? I had a body once, a handsome body, and wholesome too; now I appear like a
Rascal that had been hung a year or two in Gibbets, fie, how I faint; Women?
keep me from Women; Place me before a Cannon, it is a pleasure; stretch me upon
a Rack, a recreation; but Women? Women? O the Devil Women? courteous Gulf
was never half so dangerous; Is there no way to fall into the Cellar again,
and be taken? no lucky fortune to direct me that way? no Galleys to be got, nor
yet no Gallows? for I fear nothing now, no Earthly thing but these
unsatisfied Men-leeches, Women: how divelishly my bones ache: oh the old Lady! I
have a kind of waiting-VVoman lies cross my back too, oh how she stinks! no
treason to deliver me? now what are you? do you mock me


No sir no, we were your predecessors in this place.


And come to see how you bear up.


Good Gentlemen, you seem to have a snuffing in your head sir, a parlous
snuffing, but this same dampish air --


A dampish air indeed.


Blow your face tenderly, your nose will nere endure it; mercy on me, what are
men changed to here? is my nose fast yet? methinks it shakes in the hilts; pray
tell me Gentlemen, how long is it since you flourisht here


Not long since.


Move your self easily, I see you are tender, nor long endured.


The labor was so much sir, and so few to perform it --


Must I come to this? and draw my legs after me like a lame dog? I cannot run
away, I am too feeble; will you sue for this place again Gentlemen


No truly sir, the place has been too warm for our Complexions.


We have enough on it, rest you merry sir, we came but to congratulate your
fortune, you have abundance


Bear your fortune soberly, and so we leave you to the next fair Lady.


Stay but a little, and i will meet you Gentlemen, at the next Hospital, there is
no living thus, nor am I able to endure it longer, with all the helps and
heates that can be given me, I am at my trot already; they are fair and young
most of these Women that repair to me, but they stick on like burres, shake me
like feathers, more Women yet

Would I were honestly married, to any thing that had but half a face, and
not a great to keep her, nor a smock, that I might be civilly merry when I
pleased, rather then laboring in these fulling Mills


I see you bear up bravely yet.


Do ye hear Lady, do not make a Game-bear of me, to play me hourly, and fling
on all your Whelps; it will not hold; play me with some discretion, to day one
course, and two days hence another


If you be angry, pay back the money I redeemed you at, and take your course; I
can have Men enough: you have cost me an hundred Crowns since you came hither,
in brothes and strengthening Caudles; till you do pay me, if you will eat and
live, you shall endeavor, i will chain you to it else


Make me a Dog-kennel, i will keep your House and bark, and feed on bare bones,
and be whipped out a' doors, do ye mark me Lady? whipped, i will eat old shoes


Your business sir, if it be for a Woman, ye are cozened, I keep none here.


Certain this is the Gentleman, the very same.


Death, if I had but money, or any friend to bring me from this bondage, I
would thrash, set up a Cobblers stall, keep Hogs, and feed with 'em, sell
Tinderboxes, and knights of Ginger-bread, that is for three half pence a day,
and think it Lordly, from this base Stallion trade: why does he eye me, eye me
so narrowly


It seems you are troubled Sir, I heard you speak of want.


It Is better hearing far then relieving Sir:


I do not think so, you know me not.


Not yet that I remember.


You shall, and for your friend, be confident I love you, by this you shall
perceive it, it is Gold, and no small sum, a thousand ducats supply your want


But do you do this faithfully.


If I mean ill, spit in my face, and kick me; in what else I may serve you Sir,
command


I thank you, this is as strange to me as Knights adventure? where are you
white broth? now lusty blood come in and tell your money: it is ready here, no
threats, nor no Orations, nor prayers now


You do not mean to leave me.


I Will live in Hell sooner then here, and cooler, come quickly come, dispatch,
this airs unwholesome: quickly good Lady quickly to it


Well since it must be, the next I Will fetter faster sure, and closer.


And pick his bones, as you have done mine, pox take ye.


At my Lodging for a while, you shall be quartered, and there take Physic for
your health


I think I have found my good Angel now, if I can keep him.


IS she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own
Salvation

I tell thee she is, therefore make her Grave straight; the Crowner has sat on
her, and finds it Christian burial


How can that be, unless she drowned her self, in her* own defense?


Why it is found so.


It must be so offended, it cannot be else; for here lies the point, if I drown
my self willingly it argues an act, and an act has three branches, it is to
act, to do, to perform, or all; she drowned her self wittingly


Nay, but hear you good man Delver.


Give me leave, here lies the water, good, here stands the man, good, if the
man go to this water and drown himself, it is nill he, will he; he goes, mark
you that: but if the water come to him and drowns him, he drowns not himself;
argall, he that is not guilty of his own death, shortens not his own life


But is this Law?


I marry is it, Crowners quest law.


Will you have the truth on it, if this had not been a Gentlewoman, she should
have been buried out a' Christian burial


Why there thou say, and the more pity that great folk should have
countenance in this World to drown or hang themselves, more then meaner
christians: come my spade, there is no ancient Gentlemen but Gardeners,
ditchers and Grave-makers, they hold up Adams profession


Was he a Gentleman?


He was the first that ever bore Arms. I Will put another question to thee, if
thou answer'st me not to the purpose, confess thy self


Go to.


What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason, the Ship-wright or the
Carpenter


The Gallowes-maker, for that out-lives a thousand Tenants.


I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallows does well, but how does it
well? it does well to those that do ill, now thou dostill to say the Gallows
is built strongerthen the Church, Argall the Gallows may do well to thee, to it
again, come


Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Ship-wright or a Carpenter?


I, tell me that and unyoke.


Marry now I can tell.


To It.


Mass I cannot tell.


Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull Ass will not mend his pace
with beating, and when you are asked this question next, say a Grave-maker, the
houses he makes last till Doomesday, go get thee in and fetch me a soope of
Liquor

In youth when I did love, did love
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O the time for a my behove,
O methought there was nothing a meet.

Has this fellow no feeling of his business? a sings in Grave-making.


But age with his stealing steps
Has clawed me in his clutch,
And has shiped me into the Land,
As if I had never been such.

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once, how the knave jowles it to
the ground, as if 'twere Caines Jaw Bone, that did the first murder: this might
be the pate of a pollitician which this Ass now o'rereaches, one that would
circumvent God, might it not


It might Sir.


Or of a Courtier, which could say, good morrow my Lord, how do thou sweet
Lord? this might be my Lord such a one, that praised my Lord such a ones Horse
when he meant to beg it, might it not


I Sir.


Why even so, and now my Lady Worms choples, and knocks about the mazer with a
Sextons spade, here is fine revolution, and we had the trick to see it, did these
bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggits with 'em? mine ache to
think on it


A Pickaxe and a Spade a spade,
For and a shrowding sheet,
O a pit of Clay for to be made
For such a Guest is meet.

There Is another, why may not that be the Scull of a Lawyer? where be his
quiddities now? his quillities, his cases, his terms, and his tricks? why does
he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a durty
shovell, and will not tell him of his actions of battery? hum: this fellow
might be in's time a great buyer of Land, with his statutes, his rogguizance,
his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of
fine dirt; will vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and doubles, then
the length and breadth of a pair of Indentures? the very conveyances of his
land will scarcely lie in this Box, and must the Inheritor himself have no
more? Ha


Not a jot more Sir.


Is not parchment made of Sheep skins?


I Sir, and of Calves skins too.


They are Sheep and Calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to
this fellow: whose Grave's this firrah


Mine Sir, or a pit of Clay for to be made.


I think it is thine indeed, for thou lie in it.


You lie out on it Sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part I do not lie
in it, yet it is mine


Thou do lie in it, to be in it and say it is thine, it is for the dead, not for
the quick, therefore thou lie


It Is a quick lie Sir, 'twill again from me to you.


What man do thou dig it for?


For no man Sir.


What Woman then?


For none neither.


Who is to be buried in it?


One that was a Woman Sir, but rest her soul, she is dead.


How long have thou been a Grave-maker.


Of the days 'ith year I came to it, that day that our last King Hamlet
overcame Fortinbrass


How long is that since?


Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that; it was that very day that
young Hamlet was born, he that is mad, and sent into England


I marry, why was he sent into England?


Why, because he was mad, a shall recover his wits there, or if he do not, it is
no great matter there


Why?


'T will not been seen in him there, there are Men as mad as he.


How came he mad?


Very strangly they say.


How strangely?


Faith even with loosing his wits.


Upon what ground?


Why here in Denmark: I have been Sexton here man and boy thirty years.


How long will a man lie 'ith earth e're he rot?


Faith if he be not rotten before he dye, as we have many pocky courses that
will scarce hold the laying in, a will last you some eight year or nine year; a
Tanner will last you nine year


Why he more then another?


Why Sir his Hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that a will keep out water a
great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body: here is
a scull now has layn you 'ith earth twenty three years


Whose was it?


A whoreson mad fellow it was, whose do ye think it was?


Nay I know not.


A pest^ence on him for a mad Rogue, a powered a Flaggon of Rhenish on my head
once; this same scull Sir, was Sir Yoricks the Kings Jester


This?


'Een that.


Alas poor Yorick, I knew him friend, a fellow of infinite jest, of most
excellent fancy, but where be your Gibes now* your Gamboles, your Songs of
merryment? quite chop fa^'n? prithee friend tell me one thing


What Is that Sir?


Do thou think Alexander looked a this fashion 'ith earth?


'Een so.


And smelt so? pah.


Even so Sir.


To what base uses may we return? why may not imagination trace the noble dust
of Alexander, till a find it stopping a Bung-hole


'Twere to consider, too curiously to consider so.


No faith not a jot, but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and
likelihood to lead it: Alexander dyed, Alexander was buried, Alexander returned
to dust, the dust is Earth, of Earth we make Lome, and why of that Lome whereto
he was converted, might they not stop a Beer-barrel

Imperial Caesar dead, and turned to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away;
Oh that that Earth which kept the World in awe,
Should patch a Wall t'expell the Water flaw.

Sirrah, go fetch my Fox from the Cutlers; there is money for the scowring, tell
him, I stop a groat since the last great Muster he had in store pitch for the
bruise he took with the recoyling of his Gun


Yes sir.


And do you hear? when you come, take down my Buckler, and sweep the Cobwebs
off, and grind the Pick on it, and fetch a Nail or too, and tack on the
Bracers; your Mistress made a Potlet on it, I thank her, at her Maids wedding,
and burnt off the handle


I will sir.


Whose within here, ho, neighbor, not stirring yet?


Oh good morrow, good morrow: what news, what news?


It holds, he dies this morning.


Then happy Man be his fortune; I am resolved.


And so am I, and forty more good fellows, that will not give their heads for
the washing, I take it


'Sfoot Man, who would not hang in such good Company? and such a Cause? A fire,
a Wife, and Children, it is such a jest that Men should look behind 'em to the
World; and let their honors, their honors neighbourship. --


I Will give thee a pint of Bastard, and a Role for that bare word.


They say that we Tailors are things that lay one another, and our Geese hatch
us; I Will make some of 'em feel they are Geese 'oth Game then, Jack take down
my Bill, it is ten to one I use it; take a good heart Man, all the low Ward is
ours with a wet finger: and lay my cut-fingred Ganlet ready for me, that, that
I used to work in when the Gentlemen were up against us, and beaten out of
Town, and almost out of debt too; for a plague on 'em, they never paid well
since: and take heed sirrah, your Mistress hears not of this business, she is
near her time; yet if she do, I care not, she may long for Rebellion, for she
has a devilish spirit


Come lets call up the new Ironmunger, he is as tough as steel, and has a fine
wit in these resurrections, are you stiring Neighbor


Oh good morrow

Neighbors, I Will come to you presently.


Go to, this is his Mothers doing; she is a Ponlcat.


As any is in the World.


Then say I have hit it, and a vengeance on her Let he^ be what she will.


Amen say I, she has brought things to a fine pass with her wisdom: do you
mark it


One thing I am sure she has, the good old Duke she gives him Pap again they
say, and dandles him, and hangs a Currall and Bells about his Neck, and makes
him believe his teeth will come again, which if they did, and I he, I would
weary her as never Cur was wearyed: I would Neighbor, till my teeth meet, I
know where -- but that is council


Good morrow neighbors: hear you the sad news?


Yes, would we knew as well how to prevent it.


I cannot tell, methinks 'twere no great matter, if men were men: But. --


You do not twit me with my calling neighbor?


No surely: for I know your spirit to be tall, pray be not vexed.


Pray forward with your council: I am what I am: And they that prove me, shall
find me to their cost: do you mark me neighbor? to their cost I say


Nay look how soon you are angry.


They shall neighbor: Yes, I say they shall.


I do believe they shall.


I know they shall.


Whether you do or no, I care not two pence, I am no beast, I know mine own
strength Neighbors; God bless the King, your companyes is fair


Nay now you err, Neighbor I must tell you so, were ye twenty neighbors.


You had best go Peach, do peach.


Peach, I scorn the motion.


Do and see what follows: I Will spend an hundred pounds, and it be two I care
not, but I Will undo thee


Peach, Oh disgrace! Peach in thy face, and do the worst thou can I am a true
man, and a free man, peach


Nay, look, you will spoil all.


Peach.


Whilst you two brawle together, the Prince will loose his life.


Come give me your Hand, I love you well, are you for the action?


Yes, but Peach provokes me, it is a cold fruit, I feel it cold in my stomach
still


No more, I Will give you Cake to digest it.


Shut up my Shop, and be ready at a call boys, and one of you run over my old
Tuck with a few ashes, it is grown odious with tosting Cheese! and burn a little
Gunpowder in my murrin, the maid made it her chamber pot, an hour hence I Will
come again; and as you hear from me, send me a clean Shirt


The chandler by the Wharfe, and it be thy will.


Gossip, good morrow.


O good morrow Gossip: good morrow all, I see you of one mind ye cleave so
close together: Come it is time, I have prepared a hundred if they stand


It Is well done: shall we sever, and about it?


If my Tuck hold, I Will spit the Guard like Larkes with Sage in th'be^y o'um.


I have a foolish Bill to reckon with 'um, will make some of their hearts ache,
and I Will lay it on: now shall I fight, 'twill do ye good to see me


Come I Will do something for the Town to talk of when I am rotten: pray God
there be enough to kill, that is all


Thanks my dear Jem, I Have found thy virtue now, I had not past 'em else, a man
may have an invissible Ring I see and not know of it, what is this all the
divices sports and delights the Duke shall have for his money? the Proclamation
promises reward for him, shall show any varieties, and will it all come to a
dull Masque? I Will show his Grace some sport my self with help of my good
friend here, which now must off again, by your Majesty's leave


How now what is he?


What Is he? the wonder of your Kingdom.


How, the wonder*


I, and can do the greatest, -- now you see me you know me.


Yes Sir, I do know you.


And you all see me, you say.


We do.


And I do see all you, but what is that to the purpose?


Very little I confess.


Shall I demonstrate matter of Art, and have nothing for my pains.


No, no, the Proclamation speaks the contrary.


Well, because Royalty shall have no wrong in suspecting your Bounty -- you see
me you say


Yes, we do.


But who sees me now?


Trust me he is invissible to me.


And to us all.


I should be very sorry else; for, and my invissible Ring should not keep his
old virtue, I would hang my self directly


Prithee appear again.


I will have Majesty call me first.


Why, the Duke does call you.


Let me hear him Viva Voce, Smirk is my name, a welbeloved Subject, once a
Painter, but now Squire of the invissible Ring


Smirk, and our welbeloved Subject, once a Painter, but now Esquire of the
invissible Ring I conjure thee to appear again


See here I am, what will thou mighty Monarch?


I do command thee let me see the Ring by which thou walk'st invissible.


I do command thee not to command me that, for from my invissible Ring I will
not part


Lay hands upon him for a Sorcerer.


Assist me my dear Ring, no hands upon me, for being invissible I am a Prince,
no hands is to be laid on me, Treason does never prosper


Nay, then, what hoh.


Thy will?


Seize it, and fly.


I am gone.


How? whose that exclaimes?


The cramps in my Finger.


The cramp?


I the Cramp; the Ring that cured it is gone, the devil go with it, for on my
conscience he fetched it


What Is become of the Ring?


Pardone me my liege, the virtue that it held came from my Art, the Duchess
found the worth on it when time was


Thy knowledge in good Arts is warranted by us, since all thy actions have been
just and loyal -- -what means this


Thus was I bidden to my Sovereign,
Fall on my face, now rise I up again,
To render to the Ladies fair salutes,
And give them all their worthy Attributes,
Wonder not that I resolutly come
Boldly, thus daring press into this room,
For from a Lord'tis said of eminent note,
I bring this challenge such as can read may know it.

Very succinct and peremptory.


What is it?


A Challenge.


Read it.


For this day I am Master of the Revels.

Be it known unto all Men that I, Visconnt Shallew does Challenge all Courtiers
whatsoever at the true compendious form of compiling Epistles, Alias love
letters to Ladies, or Mistresses* either in prose or verse ex tempore or not,
ex tempore according as it shall please the challenge


Here Is unexped sport, Smirk thou shall take him up, I Will wager on thy side.


Say you so Sir, shall I be the man, 'twill recompense my loss of the Ring for
I know I shall beat him out o'th Pit with Oratry and Poetry


Which is my Antagonist?


Behold the Man with Pen and Ink provided.


Poor fool thou will but make thy self derided.


So nimble in rhyme, I Will first break your neck in prose, and afterward whip
you in verse, I Will I ambast you in couplets: you challenge all men to compose


I do.


With figures or without figures, with sentences or without sentences.


It Is right.


Draw out your pen and Inkhorn I am for you.


With expedition too, I put in that.


No, expedition belongs to Clerks, and not to Secretaries.


I Sir, celerity I mean.


No more but so, a word's enough.


Smirk goes on smoothly without any rub.


Yet there he had one.


Hold byas, and a sentence then.


Scripsi.


Et Scripsi.


Now lordings lend your Ears.


I will read it first my self.


Good reason


Fairest in the World, and sweetest upon earth.


So so, so.


I remember my duty to you in black and white.


I would it had been black and blew.


Peace.


For all colors else, wave under the standard of your beauty; you a^e the
Mistress of beauty, all other Women a^e but your handmaids


Oh abominable ba^ren.


Nay, Smirk silence, you must not interrupt your adversary.


I can say nothing, without saying too much, nor say too much without saying
nothing


I can say nothing, or else I would say something, but here it is shall shame
thee and thy Lordly botching


Methinks when thou stand in the Sun with thy feather on thy head, and thy
Fan in thy hand, thou look like the Phoenix of the East Indies, burning in
spices, for Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs are in thy breath


She would make an excellent Wassell boale.


Again, fie, fie.


I have done.


The apples of thy breast are like the Lemons of Arabia which makes the Vessel
so sweet, it can never smell of the Caske


If she should, it might prove the Brewers fault.


Being come to your middle I must draw to an end, for my end is at the middle,
because of the Proverb, In Medio consistit vertus, and so I conclude: yours
while mine own, and afterward if it were possible


Well, now let me run on, judgment I crave. --


Which thou shall have.


Illustrious, bright shining, wellspoken, an^ blood stirring Lady.


I marry Sir.


If the Rope of my capacity could reach to the Belfry of your beauty, these
words of mine like Silver Bells might be worthy to ha^g in the ears of your
favor; but the Ladder of my invention is too low to climb up to the Steeple of
your understanding


Excellent Smirk.


If it were not, I should ring out my mind to you in a sweet Peal of most
savory conceits. For your face it is like the Sun, no man is able to endure it


Very good.


Your forehead which I will neither compare to Alleblaster nor to the Lilly,
but it is, as it is, and so are both your Eyes; for your Nose, it is a well
arched bridge, which for brevity sake I pass over: Your cheeks are like a good
Comedy, worthy to be clapped: your lips and your teeth are incomparable; your
tongue like the Instrument of Orpheus, able to tame the furies: to handle every
part of you were too much, but some particular part, no man can sufficient


Prithee let me give thee a box on the Ear, for that conceit.


No my good Lord, pray keep your bounties; From top to toe you are a sweet
Vessel of delight, I dare not say a Barrel, for often times with much joulting
the Brewer beats out the bunghole, and so the good liquor runs out, but you
contain yours although not hoopt about with the old farthingall after the
newest fashion, and so I leave you fairest of a hundred, and wittyest of a
thousand, resting in little rest till I rest wholly yours in the Down bed of
affection, where ever standing to my utmost I rest all in all yours


Could any man have said more?


Spare your ce^sures a while Gentlemen; now Sir I challenge you in verse, in
praise of tall Women, and little Women, choose your subject, which you refuse
I Will take


Why then I Will take your little Women.


And I your lusty, proceed.


Some patience will be required from us, for their verse cannot come off so
roundly as their prose


As roundly as a Runlet of Sake Sir, I Will warrant ye.


Scripsi.


Sed non feci, stay a little here are a couple of lines, a Halter on 'em, they
won not twist hansomely, go forward I have ended


Attention.


Listen you tall, and likewise you low man,
I sing the praises of a bouncing Woman:
A full, well set, big-bon'd, and fairly jointed.
Fit to bid welcome, Men, are best appointed.

Excellent.


To your tall Women, your little one is nothing,
No more then is a high thing, to a low-thing.

That Is true.


For your small dandiprat, I hope there is no man,
That thinks her but a hobbyhorse to Woman,
A thing to be forgot, and never known,
But on a holy day, to the rout shown,
In Wars the Basilisco is preferred,
Before the Musket, and is louder heard.

There Is an Error, little, and loud (my friend.)


In every Triumph where there is excess,
The greater always puteth down the less.
The Lyoness is more admired at,
Then her Epitome, which is a Cat.

The fool grows serious: He has stolen it certainly.


But to weak understandings now I come,
Is your small Taber music to your Drum?

Hum, drum, he has hit within an Inch of a conceit of mine.


Or in an Instrument of peace, can there that cryal
Be made upon a Kit, as a base Violl?
Judge you my Masters, that on both have played,
It is but my opinion, and I Have said.

Come thou have said well, Smirk look to your self.


I warrant you, give me Audience.


Silence.


In praise of little Women I begin,
And will maintain what I have entered in:
Is not your Parochit, or Marmoset,
In more request then your Baboone or Parret?
Give but your little wench freely her Liquor,
And to bed send her, you will find her quicker;
Pearter, nimbler, both to kiss, and cog,
Then your great wench that will lie like a Log:
And he that all day at the Drum does labor,
Would at night gladly play upon a Taber.
I hope there is no man but of this belief,
That Veal's more sweet and nourishing then Beef:
Small meats are still preferred, for ask your Glutton,
He Will always say Lambs sweeter then your Mutton,
Your Smelt then whiting firmer is, and sounder,
Nor must your Place compare with your neat Flounder.

Well said, now thou art in good victuals thou wilt never out.


In fish or flesh I Will prove it to each wight
A Larkes leg, then the body of a Kite
Is better far; Our Bakers always make
The finest flour in the lesser Cake,
And I Will be judged by those that roots do eat,
That your small Turnip's better then your great.

I am of thy mind too.


Who list to be resolved, let 'um both try,
In that belief I live, in that I Will die

Incomparable Smirk, thou'st my voice, judgment.


A Smirk, a Smirk.


A hot day, a hot day, vengeance hot day boys, give me some drink, this fire's
a plaguey fretter: body of me I am dry still, give me the Jack boy, this wooden
skiff holds nothing


And faith Master, what brave new meats? for here will be old eating.


Old and young boy; let 'em all eat, I have it; I have ballasse for their
bellies, if they eat a Gods name, let them have ten tire of teeth a piece, I
care not


But what new rare munition.


Pish, a thousand; I Will make your Pigges speak French at Table, and a fat Swan
come sailing out of England with a Challenge; I Will make you a Dish of
Calves-feet dance the Canaries, and a consort of crammed Capons fidle to 'em; a
Calves-head speak an Oracle, and a douzen of Larkes rise from the Dish and ^ing
all super time; it is nothing boys: I have framed a fortification out of Rye
past which is impregnable, and against that, for two long hours together, two
douzen of Marrow-bones shall play continually; for fish, I Will make you a
standing lake of white broth, and Pikes come plo^ghing up the plums before
them; Arion like a Dolphin, playing lachrymo, and brave King Herring with his
Oil and Onyon crowned with a Lem^n pill, his way prepared with his strong
Guard of Pilchers


I marry Master.


All these are nothing: I Will make you a stuble Goose turn o'th toe thrice, do a
cross point presently, and sit down again, and cry come eat me: These are for
mirth: now Sir, for matter of mourning, I Will bring you in the Lady loyne of
Veal, with the long love she bore the Prince of Orange


Thou Boy, thou.


I have a trick for thee too, and a rare trick, and I have done it for thee.


What Is that good Master?


It Is a Sacrifice: a full Vine bending like an Arch, and under the blown God
Bacchus, sitting on a Hogshead, his Alter-beer: before that plump Vintner
kneeling and offering incense to his deity, which shall be only red sprats and
pilchers


This when the Tables drawn, to draw the Wine in.


Thou have it right, and then comes thy song Butler.


This will be admirable.


Oh Sir most admirable.


If you will have the Pasty speak, it is in my power, I have fire enough to work
it; what friends have thou to day? no Citizens


Yes father, the old crew.


By the Mass true Wenches: sirrah set by a Chine of Beef, and a hot Pasty,
and let the Joll of st^rgeon be corrected: and do you mark Sir, stalk me to a
Pheasant, and see if you can shout her in the Celler


God a mercy lad, send me thy roaring bottles, and with such Nectar I will see
'em filled that all thou speak shall be pure helicon


But what was it we did promise to Monsiure Latorch.


Do you ask that now?


I Will tell you It is to be all villains, knaves and Traitors.


Fine wholesome titles.


But if you dare go forward.


May be hanged drawn and quartered.


Very true Si^.


What a goodly swing I shall give the Gallows? yet I think too, this may be
do^e, and yet we may be rewarded, not with a Rope, but wit^ a Royal Master: and
yet we may be hanged too


Say it were done; who is it done for? is it not for ^lio? and for his right?


And yet we may be hanged too?


Or say he take it, say we be discovered? Is not the same mam found to protect
us? are we not his


Sure he will never fail us.


If he do, friends, we shall find that will hold us; and yet methinks, this
Prologue to our purpose, the Crowns were given, should promise more: It Is
easily done, as easy as a man would roast an Egg, if that be all; for look
you, Gentlemen, here stand my brothes, my finger slips a little, down drops a
Dosse, I stir him with my Ladle, and there is a Dish for a Duke: Ol^a podrida,
here stands a Baked meat, he wants a little seasoning, a foolish mistake; my
Spice-box, Gentlemen, and put in some of this, the matter's ended; dredge you a
dish of Plo^ers, there is the a^t on it


Or as I fill my Wine.


It Is very true Sir, blessing it with your hand, thus quick and neatly first,
when it is past and done once, it is as easy for him to thank us for it, and
reward us


But it is a damned sin.


Oh never fear that, the fire's my playfellow, and now I am resolved boys.


Why then have with you.


The same for me.


For me too.


And now no more our worships, but our Lordships.


Not this year on my knowledge, I Will un-Lord you.


Make room before there, room for the Prisoners.


Are these the Youths?


These are the Youths you look for, and pray my honest friends be not too
hasty, there will be nothing done till we come I assure you


Here Is a wise hanging, are there no more?


Do you hear, you may come in for your share, if you please.


Before, before, Boys here is enough to make us sport.


Pox take you, do you call this sport? are these your recreations? must we be
hanged to make you mirth


Do you hear Sir? you custard pate, we go to it, for high treason, an Honorable
fault: thy foolish father was hanged for stealing sheep


Away Boys, away.


Do you see how that sneaking Rogue looks now? you, chip, Pantler, peaching
Rogue, that provided us these Neck-laces: you poor Rogue, you costive Rogue you


Pray, pray, fellows.


Pray for thy crusty Soul? where is your reward now goodman manchet for your
fine discovery? I do beseech you Sir, where are your dollers? draw with your
fellows and be hanged


You must now, for now he shall be hanged first, that is his comfort, a place
too good for thee thou mealy-mouthed Rascal


Hang hansomely, for shame come leave your praying, you peaking knave, and be
like a good Courtier; die daringly, and like a man; no preaching, with I
beseech you take example by me, I lived a lewd man, good people; pox on it: die
me as if thou had dined, say grace, and Heaven be with you


Come will you forward?


Good Mr. Sheriff, your leave to, this hasty work was never done well, give us
so much time as but to Sing our own ballads for we will trust no man, nor no time
but our own, 'twas done in Ale too, your penny pot Poets, are such pelting
thieves, they ever hang men twice, we have it here Sir, and so must every
Merchant of our Voyage, he will make a sweet return else of his Credit


One fit of our mirth, and then we are for you.


Make have then, dispatch.


There Is day enough Sir.


Come Boys, sing cheerfully, we shall never sing younger; we have chosen a
lewd tune too, because it should like well


Come, fortune's a Whore I, care not who tells her,
Would offer to strangle a Page of the Celler,
That should by his Oath, to any man's thinking,
And place, have had a defense for his drinking;
But thus she does still, when she pleases to palter
Instead of his wages, she gives him a Halter.

Three merry boys and three merry boys and three merry boys are we
As ever did sing in a bempen string, under the Gallow Tree.

But I that was so lusty,
And ever kept my Bottles,
That neither they were musty,
And seldom less then Pottles;
For me to be thus stopped now,
With 'hem instead of Cork Sir,
And from the Gallows topt now,
Shows that there is a Forke Sir,
In death, and this the token
Man may be two ways killed,
Or like the Bottle broken,
Or like the Wine, be spilled.

And three merry Boys, etc.


Oh yet but look on the Master Cook, the glory of the Kitchen,
In sowing whose fate, at so loftly a rate, no Tailor e're had stitching,
For though he makes the man, the Cook he makes the Dishes;
The which no Tailor can, wherein I have my wishes,
That I who at so many a feast have pleased so many tasters
Should now my self come to be dressed a dish for you my Masters.

And three merry Boys, etc.


There Is a few copies for you; now farewell friends: and good Mr. Sheriff let
me not be printed with a Brass pot on my head


March fair, march fair, before good Captain Pantler.


Oh man, or beast, or you at least
That were or brow or Autler,
Prick up your ears, unto the tears
Of me poor Paul the Pantler,
That thus am clipped, because I chipt
The cursed crust of Treason:
With loyal knife! Oh doleful strife
To hang thus without reason.

Have thou packt up all thy things? nay prithee weep not.


Affection Sir will burst out, but Master wherefore should we be parted?


Because my fortunes are desperate.


But whether do you mean to go Master?


Why to Sea man, to sea.


Lord bless us methinks I hear of a tempest already.


Where dwells Mr. Bubble?


What is your business with Mr. Bubble? I am the Man.


May I be assured that your name is Mr Bubble?


I tell thee honest friend my name is Mr Bubble, Mr Bartholomew Bubble.


Why then Sir you are Heir to a million; your Uncle the rich Usurer is dead.


Hum, hum.


How my little Bubble is blown up with the news.


Where Is the Worshipful Mr. Bubble?


The Worshipful, what you do with the Worshipful Mr. Bubble? I am the Man.


Mr. Thong the Beltmaker by me gives you notice that your Uncle is dead, and
you are his only Heir


Thy news is good and I have looked for it long,
Thanks unto thee my friend, and good man Thong:
Come Master now you shall not need to travel,
Nor feast your Toes with dirt and scurvy Gravel.

I, I, he is gone, he is gone.


What then? it is not you can fetch him again, it must be your comfort that he
dyed well


Truly so it is, I would to God I had even another Uncle that would dye no
worse, the remembrance of death is sharp Gentlemen, therefore there is a
Banquet within to sweeten your conceits


Well, Mr. Bubble we will go in and taste of your bounty, in the mean time you must
be of good cheer


If grief take not away my stomach, I will have good cheer.


If grief take not away my stomach I will have good cheer: -- Sprinckle, Had
the women puddens to their dole


Yes Sir.


And how did they take them?


With their hands Sir.


O thou Hercules of ignorance, I mean how were they satisfied?


By my troth Sir, but so so, and yet some of them had two.


O insatiable Women! whom two puddins would not satisfy,

Off with my mourning Robes, grief to the grave,
For I have Gold and therefore will be brave:
In Silks I Will rattle it of every color
And when I go by water, scorn a skullar:
In black cornation Velvet I will cloak me,
And when Men bid God save me, cry Tu Quoque:
It is needful a Gentleman should speak Latin some times, is it not Gervase?


O very graceful, your most accomplished Gentlemen are known by it.


Then I Will use that little I have upon all accasions.


Thanks, and Tu Quo is a word for all, but Gervase how shall I behave my self
to the Gentlewomen


Why advance your self toward them, and for your discourse your Tu Quoque
will bear you out


Nay, and that be all I care not, I Will set a good face on it that is flat, and
here is a leg? if ever a Baker in England show me a better I Will give him mine
for nothing


Oh that is a special thing that I must caution you of, never whilst you live
commend your self, the more vilely you speak of your, -- the more the Ladies
will appla^d


Say thou so Gervase, then let me alone to dispraise my self, I Will make my
self the a^antest Coxcomb in a whole Country, is this the eldest si


Yes marry is she sir.


I Will kiss the youngest first, because she likes me ^est, by the mass they
kiss exceeding well, I do not think out they have been brought up to 't, --
now to my speech Lady -- even a -- Drumer or a Pewterer --


Very good sir.


Do, -- do, do. --


What do they do?


By my troth I do not know; for to say truth I am a kind of an Ass.


How sir, an Ass?


So God have me I am Lady, you never saw an erranter Ass in your life, pray
look upon me Lady


So I do sir.


But look upon me well, and tell me if ever you saw a Man look so simply as I
do, did you ever see a worse timber'd Leg, what say you, can you find e're a
good inch about me


Yes that I can sir.


Find it and take it Lady; there I think I bob'd her Iervase, -- come Ladies
will you lead the way


Ah while you live Men before Women, custom has played it so.


Why then custom is not so mannerly as I would be.


Pray let me see your hand, the line of your Maidenhead is out, now for your
fingers; upon which finger will you wear your Wedding-ring


Upon no finger.


Then I perceive you mean to wear it upon your Thumb, well the time is come
sweet Joyce, the time is come


What to do sir.


For me to tickle thy Tu Quoque, therefore prepare, provide to morn to meet me
as a Bride


I Will meet thee like a Ghost first.


Did I eat my Lettice to Supper last night that I am so sleepy, thy eyes are
close too Brother Bubble


As fast as a Kentish Oyster, surely I was begot in a Plumb-Tree, I have such a
deal of Gum about my eyes, what is this about my shins


We have metamorphosed our Stoacking for want of Splendour.


Pray, what is that Splendour?


Why, it is the Latin word for a Christmas candle.


Tu Quoque to all: What shall we go to Church? I long to be about this gear.


You may take out the other nap now, for you are cozened, and made a coxcombe.


That word coxcombe goes against my Stomach.


And against mine, a man might have digested a Woodcock better.


Do you know that youth in Satin, he is the penner to that Inkhorn.


Are not you my man Gervase? have you married her?


The Priest has Sir.


Then am worse then ten Coxcombes.


And a beggarly one, your time of pageantry is over, sergeants take him to ye.


How Is this, is my Tu Quoque come to an Et cetera


If you can put off your former pride and put on this with that humility that
you first wore it, I will pay your debts, free you of all encumbrances, and
take you again into my service


It Is, but faces about, and be as I was, Tenterhook let me go, I will take his
Worships offer, rather then be kept in you clutches, a man in a Blew coat may
have some color for his Knavery, when in the Counter he can have none


COme my brave mirmidons, lets fall on, let our Caps swa^me my boys, and your
nimble Tongues forget your Mother Gib-rish, of what do you lack, and set your
mouths up Children, till your Pallats fall frighted half a fathom, past the
cure of Bay Salt and gross Pepper, and then cry Philaster, brave Philaster,
let Philaster be deeper in request, my ding-dongs, my paires of dear
Indentures, King of Clubs, then your cold water chamblets, or your paintings
spitted with copper, let not your hasty silks or your branched cloth of
bodkin, or your tishnes, dearly beloved of spiced Cake and Custard, your
Robinhoods scarlet and John's, tie your affections in darkness to your shops,
no dainty Duckers, up with your three-pil'd spirits, your wrought valors, and
let your uncut collar make the King feel the measure of your mightiness
Philaster, cry my Rose-nobles cry

Philaster, Philaster.


How do you like this my Lord Prince, these are mad boys* I tell you, these
are things that will not strike their Top-sailes to a foarst, and let a Man of
War an Argosy bull, and cry Cocks


Why you rude slave, do you know what you do?


My pretty Prince of Puppets, we do know, and give your greatness warning,
that you talk no more such bug-words, or that soldred Crown shall be scratched
with a Musket; Dear Prince Pippin, down with your noble blood, or as I live
i will have you codled; let him lose my spirits, make as a round Ring with your
Bills my Hectors, and let us see what this trim Man dares do; now sir have at
ye, here I lie, and with this swashing blow, do you sweat Prince; I could hack
your Grace, and hang ye up crosse-leg'd, like a Hare at a Poulterers


You will not see me murdered wicked Villains.


Yes indeed we will sir, we have not seen one foe a great while.


He would have weapons, would he? give him a broadside my brave Boys with your
Pikes, branch me his skin in flowers like a Satin, and between every flower a
mortal cut, your Royalty shall ravell, jag him Gentlemen, i will have him cut to
the kell, then down the seames, oh for a whip to make him Galoom-laces, i will
have a Coach-whip


O spare me Gentlemen.


Hold, hold, the Man begins to fear and know himself, he shall for this time
only be sealed up with a feather through his nose, that he may only see Heaven,
and think whether he is going, nay my beyond Sea sir, we will proclaim you, you
would be King; thou tender heir apparent to a Church-ale, thou slight Prince
of single scarce^et; thou Royal ring-taile fit to fly at nothing but poor men's
Poultrey, and every Boy beat thee from that too with his bread and butter


Gods keep me from these hell hounds.


Shall's geld him Captain?


No, you shall ^pare his dowcets my dear Donsells, as you respect the Ladies
let them flourish; the curses of a longing woman kills as speedy as a Plague
Boys


I Will have a leg that is certain.


I Will have an arm.


I Will have his nose and at my own charge, build a College and clap't upon the
Gate


I Will have his little Gut to string a ^it with, for certainly a royal Gut will
sound like Silver


Would they were in thy belly, and I past my pain once.


Good Captain let me have his liver to feed Ferrets.


Who will have parcells else? speak.


Good Gods consider me I shall be tortured.


Captain I Will give you the trimming of your Hand-sword; and let me have his
s^in to make false scabbards


He had no horns Sir had he?


No Sir, he is a palla^d, what would thou do with ho^nes?


O if he had, I would have made rare Hafts and whistles of 'em, but his vain
bones if they be sound shall serve me


Long long live Philaster, the brave Prince Philaster, I thank ye Gentlemen,
but why are these rude weapons brought abroad? to teach your hands uncivil
trades


We are the royal Rosicleeze, we are thy mirmidons thy Guard, thy rourers, and
when the Noble body is in durance, thus do we clap our musty murryons on, and
trace the streets in terror, ^is it peace thou Mars of men? is the King
sociable, and bids thee i^e? Art thou above thy foemen and froe as Phoebus?
speak, of not, this stand of Royal Blood shall be broach, a tilt and run even
to the lees of Honor


Hold and be satisfied, I am my self, free as my thoughts are: By the Gods I
am


Art thou the dainty Darling of the King? art thou the hylas to our Hercules?
does the Lords bow, and the regarded Scarlets, kiss their gum'd gols and cry we
are your servants? Is the Court navigable, and the presence struck with Flags
of friendship? if not, we are thy Castle, and this man sleeps


I am what I do desire to be your friend; I am what I was born to be your
Prince


Sir there is some humanity in you, you have a noble Soul forget my name, and
know misery, set me safe aboard from these wild camballs, and as I live, I Will
quit this Land for ever


I do pity you: friends discharge your fears, deliver me the Prince.


Good Sir take heed he does not hurt you, he is a fierce man I can tell you Sir.


Prince by your leave, I Will have a surfingle, and make you like a hawk.


Away, away, there is no danger in him, alas he had rather sleep to shake his
fit off, good my friends go to your houses and by me have your pardons and my
love and for an earnest drink this


Long may thou live brave Prince, brave Prince, brave Prince.


Thou art the King of Courtesies: fall off again my sweet youths, come, and
every ne^ce to his house again, and hang his pewter up, then to the Tavern and
bring your wives in muffs, we will have Music, and the red Grape shall make us
dance and rise boys


Go get the Drums, beat round Leiutenant.


Hark ye, Sir, I have a foolish business they call Marryage.


After the Wars are done.


The Party stays Sir, I have given the Priest his money too: all my friends
Sir, my Father, and my Mother


Will ye go forward.


She brings a pretty matter with her.


Half a douzen Bastards.


Some forty Sir.


A goodly competency.


I mean Sir, pounds a year; I Will dispatch the matter, it is but a night or two;
I Will overtake ye Sir


Where lies the horse quarter?


And if it be a Boy, I Will even make bold Sir.


Away with your whore, a plague o'your whore, damned Rogue, now you are cured
and well; must ye be clicketing


I have broke my mind to my ancient, in my absence, he is a sufficient Gentleman.


Get forward.


Only receive her portion.


Get ye forward; else I Will bang ye forward.


Strange Sir, a Gentleman and an Officer, cannot have the liberty to do the
Office of a man


Shame light on thee, how came this whore into thy head?


This w^ore Sir? it is strange, a very poor whore.


Do not answer me: Troop, troop away; Do not name this whore again, or think
there is a whore


That Is very hard Sir.


Turn but thy face, and do but make Mouths at 'em.


And have my teeth knocked out; I thank you heartily.


what the devil ailes thee? d^st long to be hanged?


Faith sir, I make no suit for it: but rather then I would live thus out of
charity, continually in brawling. --


And will thou never fight more?


'Ith mind I am in.


Nor never be sick again?


I hope I shall not.


Prithee be sick again; prithee, I beseech thee, be just so sick again.


I Will need'st be hanged first.


If all the arts that are can make a collique, therefore look to it; or if
imposthums mark me, as big as foot balls. --


Deliver me.


O^ stones of ten Pound weight 'ith Kidneys, through ease and ugly dyets may be
gathered; I Will feed ye up my self, I Will prepare ye, you cannot fight, unless
the devil fears ye, you shall not want provocations, I Will scratch ye, I Will
have thee have the Toothache and the headache


Good Colonel, I Will do any thing.


No, no, nothing -- then will I have thee blown with a pair of Smiths bellows,
because you shall be sure to have a round Gale with ye, filled full of Oil,
o'devill, and aquafortis, and let these work, these may provoke


Good Colonel.


A coward in full blood prithee be plain with me, will roasting do thee any
good


Nor basting neither sir.


Marry that goes hard, -- do you see that thing there*


What thing? I see the brave Leiutenant.


Rogue what a name have thou lost? be ruled yet, I Will beat thee on; go winck
and fight: a plague upon your sheep heart


What Is all this matter?


Nay I cannot show ye.


There Is twenty Pound, go but smell to 'em.


Alas sir, I have taken such a cold I can smell nothing.


I can smell a rascal, a rank rascal: fie how he stincks, stinks like a
tired jade


What sir?


Why that sir, do not you smell him?


Smell him.


Stinks like a dead Dog, carrion -- there is no such damnable smell under heaven
as the faint sweat of a coward: will ye fight yet


Nay, now I defye ye; ye have spoke the worst ye can of me, and if every man
should take what you say to the heart --


God a mercy, God a mercy with all my heart; here I forgive thee; and fight, or
fight not, do but go along with us and keep my Dog


I love a good Dog naturally.


What Is all this stir Leiutenant?


Nothing sir, but a slight matter of argument.


Pox take thee: sure I shall love this Rogue, he is so pretty a Coward; come
play fellow, come, prithee come up; come Chicken, I have a way shall fit yet; a
tame knave; come, look upon us


I Will tell you who does best boys.


That he is sick again.


Extremely sick; his disease grown incurable, never yet found, nor touched at.


Well we have it and here he comes.


The Prince has been upon him what a platter face he has now? it takes, believe
it; how like an Ass he looks


I feel no great pain, at least I think I do not; yet I feel sensibly I grow
extremely faint: how cold I sweat now


So, so, so.


And now it is even too true, I feel a pricking, a pricking, a strange pricking:
how it tingles? and as it were a stitch too: the Prince told me, and every one
cried out I was a dead man; I had thought I had been as well


Upon him now boys, and do it most demurely.


How now Leiutenant.


I thank ye Gentlemen.


Life, how looks this man? how do thou good Leiutenant?


I ever told ye this man was never cured, I see it too plain now; how do ye
feel your self? you look not perfect, how dull his eye hangs


That may be discontent.


Believe me friend I would not suffer now the tithe of those pains this man
feels; mark his forehead, what a cloud of cold dew hangs upon it


I have it, again I have it; how it grows upon me? a miserable man I am.


Ha, ha, ha, a miserable man thou shall be, this is the tamest trout I ever
tickled


This way he went.


Pray heaven we find him living, he is a brave fellow, it is pity he should
perish thus


A strong hearted man, and of a noble sufferance.


Ho, ho,


How now? how is it man.


Oh Gentlemen, never so full of pain.


Did I not tell ye?


Never so full of pain Gentlemen.


He is here; how do ye Sir.


Be of good comfort Soldier, the Prince has sent us to you.


Do you think I may live.


Yes you may live; but. --


Finely butted Doctor.


Do not discourage him.


Here comes the Prince.


How now Gentlemen?


bewailing Sir, a soldier, and one I Demetrius think your Grace will greive to
part with, but every living think. --


It Is true, must perish, our lives are but our marches to our Graves, how do
thou now Leiutenant


Faith it is true Sir, we are but spans and candles ends.


He Is finely mortified.


I see he alters strangely; and that a pace too, I saw it this morning in him,
when he poor man I dare ^wear. --


No beleiv't sir, I never felt it.


How he swells?


The imposthume fed with a new malignant humor now will grow to such a bigness,
it is incredible, the compass of a Bushel will not hold it, and with such a
hell of torture it will rise too. --


Can you endure me touch it?


Oh, I beseech you Sir? I feel you sensibly e're you come near me.


He Is finely wrought, he must be cut, no cure else, and suddenly, you see how
fast he blows out


Good Mr. Doctor, let me be beholding to you, I feel I cannot last.


For what Leiutenant?


But even for half a douzen cans of good Wine, that I may drink my Will out; I
faint hideously


Fetch him some Wine, and since ^e must go Gentlemen, why let him take his
journey merrily


That Is even the nearest way.


Here off with that.


These two I give your Grace, a poor remembrance of a dying man Sir, and I
beseech you wear 'em out


I will soldier, these are fi^e Legacies.


Among the Gentlemen, even all I have left; I am a poor man, naked, yet
something for remembrance; four a piece Gentlemen, and lay my body where you
please


It will work.


I make your Grace my Executor, and I beseech you see my poor will fulfilled;
sure I shall walk else


As full as they can be filled, here is my hand soldier.


I would hear a Drum beat but to see how I could endure it.


Beat a Drum there.


Oh Heavenly music, I would hear one sing to it, I am very full of pain.


Sing? it is impossible.


Why, then I would drink a Drum full; where lies the Enemy?


Why, here close by.


Now he begins to m^ster.


And dare ye fight? dare ye fight Gentlemen?


You must not cut him: he is gone then in a moment, all the hope left, is to
work his weakness into sudden anger, and make him raise his passion above his
pain, and so dispose him on the Enemy; his body then being stirred with
violence, will purge it self and break the sore


It Is true sir.


And then my life for his.


I will not die thus.


But he is too weak to do. --


Die like a Dog?


I he is weak but yet he is heart-hole.


Hem.


An excellent sign.


Hem.


Stronger still, and better.


Hem, hem; Ran, tan, ran, tan, tan.


Now he is 'ith way on it.


Well go thy ways, thou will do something certain.


And some brave thing, or let mine Ears be cut off.


Fetch him off, fetch him off; I Am sure he is clouted; did I not tell you how
'twould take


It Is admirable


Follow that blow my friend, there is at your Coxcombs, I fight to save me from
the surgeons miseries


How the knave curryes 'em?


You cannot Rogues, till you have my diseases, fly my fury, ye bread and butter
Rogues, do you run from me? and my side would give me leave, I would so hunt
ye, ye porredg-gutted slaves, ye Veal-broth boobies


Enough, enough Leiutenant, thou have done bravely.


Mirror of man.


There Is a Flag for ye Sir, I took it out o'th shop, and never paid for it I Will
to 'em again, I am not come to the text yet


No more my soldier: beshrew my heart he is hurt sore.


Hang him he will lick all those whole.


Now will we take him, and cure him a trice.


Be careful of him.


Let me live but two years, and do what ye will with me: I never had but two
hours yet of happynes,; pray ye give me nothing to provoke my Valor, for I am
even as weary of this fighting* --


You shall have nothing; come to the Princes Tent, and there the Surgeons
presently shall search ye, then to your rest


A little hansome Litter to lay me in, and I shall sleep.


Look to him.


I do believe a horse begot this fellow, he never knew his strength yet.


Oh faint not heart, Susan my Lady dear: the Cobblers Maid in Milk-street for
whose sake, I take these Arms, O let the thought of thee, carry thy Knight
through all the adventerous Deeds, and in the honor of thy beauteous self,
may I destroy this monster Barbarosso, knock Squire upon the Basin, till it
break with the shrill strokes, or till the Grant speak


O George the Giant, the Giant, now Rafe for thy life.


What fond unknowing wight is this that dares, so rudely knock at Barbarosso's
cell, where no man comes, but leaves his fleece behind


I, Traiterous caitife, who am sent by fate to punish all the sad enormities
thou have committed against Ladies gentle, and errant Knights, Traitor to heaven
and men: prepare thyselfe, this is the dismal hour appointed for thee, to give
strict account of all thy beastly treacherous villainies


Fool hardy Knight, full soon thou shall aby this fond reproach thy body will I
bang, and lo upon that string shall hang: prepare thy self, for dead soon
shall thou be


Saint George for me.


Gargantua for me.


To him Rafe to him, hold up the Giant, set out thy leg before Rafe.


Falsify a blow


falsify a blow, the Giant lies open on the left side.


Bear't off, bear't off still; there boy, O Rafe's almost down, Rafe's almost
down


Susan inspire me, now have up again.


Up, up, up, so Rafe, down with him, down with him Rafe.


Fetch him over the hip boy.


There boy, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill Rafe.


No Rafe get all out of him first.


Presumptious man, see to what desperate end thy treachery has brought thee,
the just Gods, who never prosper those that do despise them, for all the
villan^es which thou have done to Knights and Ladies, now have paid thee home
by my stiff Arm, a Knight adventurous; but say vile wretch before I send thy
soul to sad avernus, whether it must go, what captives holds't thou thy sable
Cave


Go in and free them all, thou have the day.


Go Squire and Dwarffe, search in this dreadful Cave, and free the wretched
Prisoners from their bo^ds


I crave for mercy, thou art a Knight, and scorn'st to spill the blood of those
that beg


Thou show no mercy, nor shall thou have any, prepare thy self for thou
shall surely die


Behold brave Knight here is one prisoner, whom this wild man has used as you
see


This is the wisest word I heard the Squire speak.


Speak what thou art, and how thou have been used, that I may give him condign
punishment


I am a Knight that took my journey post northward from London, and in
courteous wise, this Giant trained me to his den, under pretense of killing of
the I^ch, and all my body with a powder strewn, that smarts and stings, and
cut away my beard, and my curled locks wherein were Ribands tied, and with a
water washed my tender eyes, whilst up and down about me still he skipt, whose
virtue is* that till my eyes be wipt with a dry cloth* for this my foul
disgrace, I shall not dare to look a Dog in the face


Alas poor Knight releife him Rafe, releife poor Knights whilst you live.


My trusty Squire convey him to the Town where he may find releife, adue fair
Knight


Pussiant Knight of the Burning Pestle hight, see here another wretch, whom
this foul beast has scorcht and scor'd in this unhumane wise


Speak me thy name, and eke thy place of birth, and what has been thy usage in
this Cave


I am a Knight Sir Pock-hole is my name, and by my birth I am a Londoner, free
by my Copy, but my Ancestors were Frenchmen all, and riding hard this way, upon
a trotting horse my bones did ache, and I faint Knight to ea^e my weary limbs,
light at this Cave, when straight this furious fiend, with sharpest Instrument
of purest steel, did cut the Gristle of my Nose away, and in the place this
velvet plaster stands, relieve me gentle ^night out of his hands


Good Rafe relieve Sir Pock-hole, and send him away, for in truth his breath
stinks


Convey him st aight after the other Knight, Sir Pock-hole fa^e you well.


Kind Sir good night.


Hark George, what a woeful ^ry there is I think some Women lies in there.


What ghastly noise is this? speak Barbarossa, or by this blazing steel thy head
goes off


Prisoners of mine, whom I in diet keep, send lower down into the Cave, and in
a Tub that is heated smoking hot, there may they find them and deliver them


Run Squire and Dwarffe, deliver them with speed.


But will not Rafe kill this Giant, surely I am afraid if he let him go he will
do as much hurt, as ever he did


Not so mouse neither, if he could convert him. I George, if he could convert
him; but a Giant is not so soon converted as one of us ordinary people. There Is
a pretty tale of a Witch, that had the devils mark about her, God bless us,
that had a Giant to her son, that was called Lob -- ly -- by -- the fire, did
never hear it George. Citiz. Peace Nell here comes the prisoners


Here be these pined wretches manfull Knight, that for these six weeks have
not seen a wight


Deliver what you are, and how you came
To this sad Cave, and what your usage was.

I am an Errant-Knight that followed Arms,
With Spear and Shield; and in my tender years,
I stricken was with Cupid's fiery Shaft,
And fell in love with this my Lady dear,
And stole her from her Friends in Turnbal-street,
And bore her up and down from Town to Town,
Where we did eat and drink, and Music hear:
Till at the length, at this unhappy Town
We did arrive; and coming to this Cave,
This Beast us caught, and put us in a Tub;
Where we this two months sweat, and should have done
Another month, if you had not relieved us.

This Bread and Water has our Diet been;
Together with a Rib cut from a Neck
Of burned Mutton. Hard has been our Fare:
Release us from this ugly Giants Snare.

This has been half the food we have received;
But only twice a day for novelty,
He gave a spoonful of his hearty Broth
To each of us, through this same tender Quill.

From this infernal Monster you shall go,
That uses Knights and Gentile-Ladies so.
Convey 'em hence

Mercy, great Knight: I do recant my ill;
And henceforth never Gentile-Blood will spill.

I give thee Mercy: but yet thou shall swea^
Upon my Burning Pestle, to perform
Thy promise uttered.

I swear and kiss.


Depart then, and amend.
Come, Squire and Dwarf, the Sun grows toward his set;
And we have many more Adventures yet.

SIrrah Simpleton, where are you?


Here, here, Father.


Where, where, Sirrah?


At the Cupboard, Father; at the Cupboard.


I thought as much: but come you hither, Sirrah, or I shall make your Ears sing
Prick-song for you


It Is a miserable condition that a man cannot eat a little bit for his
After-noons Lunchin, but he must be disturbed in the best of his Stomach


A bit! do thou call it? OF my Conscience this devouring Rascal, old as I am,
would eat me if he found me in the Cupboard


I do not think there is such a genteel Smith in the Town, that has such an
old niggardly Coxcomb to his Father as I: he knows I have no better a stomach
then a young Green Sickness Girl, and yet he grutches me every bit I eat


Leave off your muttering, and lend me an Ear a while.


Truly I cannot spare one, Father: yet now I think on it, you have great
occasion for one ever since the last Pillory-day; but since you are my Father,
I will vouchsafe to listen a while


You know that I am old.


The more's the pity that you were not hanged while you were young.


Thou have drunk most of my Means away.


IN ll eat out the rest.


Leave your ill breeding, and give me sensibly a Reason why you will not work.


Because I am lazy, Father.


Nay, that is true.


True? why, do you think I would be so unmannerly to tell you a Lie, Father?


How I shall maintain that coming stomach of yours, unless your self endeavor
for it, I know not: but if thou will be ruled, I 'll make thee a Man


A Man! why what am I now, a Mouse? what would you make of me?


An Ass, an Ass, a gross Ass.


You may well make me a gross Ass, you have so good a pattern.


Listen to me: you know the Widows Daughter at the Corner, sweet Mistress
Dorothy; she is both young and handsome, and has money too


I, and that will help to buy victuals.


Go and woo her, and I dare lay my Life thou carriest her.


I carry her, Father? Alas! I have but a weak back, and besides I am somewhat
lazily given, as you say: it were a great deal better that she would carry me


Thou have no more wit then my Hammers head has, and no more brains then an
Anvil, which every one may strike on, but never move it: Go, take your Fiddle,
at that they say you are excellent; and when she thanks thee from her
Chamber-window, say thou art my son, and that I sent thee about the thing she
wots of


O must I bumfiddle her under her Chamberwindow? Well, I will go wash my hands,
and starch my face, because I may be sure to go cleanly about my business


Now must I go play an Alampadoe under Mistress Dorothy's Chamber-window, and
all that time perhaps she is a snorting: for to say the truth, my Music will
hardly have the virtue to waken her; and if she should wake, I could not tell
what to say to her, unless it were to desire her to go to bed again. And
because I will be sure to be acceptable to her, I will join my
Nightingale-Voyce thereunto


What Slave is this presumes to court my Mistress? Could I but see him, I would
satisfy my anger with the ruin of his limbs; but he is gone, and I loose time
in seeking


That was a roaring Rogue, he has made my Heart jump upright into my Mouth; and
if I had not held it fast with my Teeth, without doubt it had forsaken my Body;
but he is gone, and now I will venture forward


I heard some Music at my Sweet-hearts window: could I but find him, I would
cut him, and slash him till his whole body were anatomized: but he is gone, and
it was his wisest course


That roaring Rogue was far worse then the to other; he has almost frighted my
Song out of my head. Oh! we true and faithful Lovers, what perils and dangers
must we undergo, to gain the wills and affections of our dearest Dears? But now
to my Music; and because she shall take a great pleasure to think on it, I
will sing a song of a young Wench that had a great mind to be married before
her time

Oh! Mother let me have a Husband kind, with toitre, loytre, loitre.
That day and night I may comfort find of a toitre, etc.
I care not whether honest Man or Knave, so that he keep me fine and brave,
And that none else but I may have his toitre, etc.
Oh Daughter you are not old enough for a toitre, etc.
And Husbands often do prove rough with a toitre, etc.
Your tender heart no grief can carry, as they must do sometimes that marry:
You yet may well a twelve-moneth tarry for a toitre, etc.
Oh! Mother I am in my teens, for a toitre, etc.
And younger Wives are often seen with a toitte, etc.
I pray let me not so idle stand, for I can do as well as any can,
I have had a proof with John our Man of his toitre, etc.
Well, if she does not run mad for me now, it is pity she should have Music
under her VVindow as long as she lives


Oh is it you? I thought none but a Puppy like your self, would have disturbed
the Neighbors with your Gridiron-musick: a Saw were far more pleasing


Forsooth I am very sorry that you have no better skill in Music; in my
Opinion I sung most melodiously: but if you will be pleased to look with Eyes
of judgment upon me, you will express your love in a better manner to me


I shall express my love, if you continue here, in a far worser manner then you
think for. Do you see this Chamber Pot? it longs to be acquainted with that
brainless head of yours: therefore be gone, and save your self a washing


If you should wash me, I think it would be but labor in vain: yet if you
please to distill any of your sweet water upon me, I shall desire to be smelt
out by you


You Ass, you Puppy; must you needs force a drowning?


Is this the beginning of love? It is almost as bad as the Proverb to me: stay,
it may be it is Rosewater. Voh, it is as rank Urine as ever any Doctor cast.
I Will call this same Old Simpleton my Father that set me about this business.
Oh, Father Simpleton, where are you


Oh my Son, how have thou sped, Boy?


O! I have sped most abominably, Father: I got a great deal more then I
expected


Oh my own natural Boy!


I, natural, to be sure, I had never come here else.


But how did she relish thee?


Why she relished me with a whole Chamber Pot full of water.


Why thou Ass, thou Puppy, thou Fool, thou Coxcomb.


Why? how can I help it? why did you get me so like a Fool?


Come, show me to her, and you shall see how I will handle her.


Nay, Father, I should be loath to marry her, after you have had the handling
of her


This is her Chamber, is it not?


Yes: I know it by a good token; for here she opened the Sluice, and let the
Floodgates out upon me


Mistress Dorothy, Mistress Dorothy, pray come to the window.


Pray to the window, Mistress Dorothy.


Sirrah, hold your tongue.


What again? sure this whole morning is nothing but my trouble: what
VVise-aker is that now


She calls you VVise-aker: speak now.


I am your Neighbor, Old Simpleton the Smith.


And I Young Simpleton the Smith.


Oh Neighbor, is it you? Here was your Son but now, and he kept a worse noise
then a Bear-baiting: but you are civil, I will come down to you


Look you there, Sirrah; she will come down to me, she says.


I, by that time I have been a Courtier as long as you have been, one woman or
other may come down to me


Good morrow, Neighbor: what is your business, pray?


Why it is this: this is my Son. Nay, it is my Son, I Will assure you.


Yes, forsooth, he is sure I am his Son; my Mother told him so.


Now I look better on him, he seems to me more handsome then before; your
company seasons him with discretion: but what is your business, pray Sir


Why, if you please, forsooth, I would fain join you two together in the way
of Matrimony


Yes forsooth, to mock a marriage.


But hold, Sir, two words to a bargain: what profession is your Son of?


Forsooth I am a Blacksmith: and though I say it, I have as good VVorking-gear
as any Smith in the Parish; all my Neighbors Wives shall be my witness


Sirrah, hold your tongue.


Why, shall I come a wooing, and say nothing for my self?


But what Estate, I pray, has your Son in posse?


Father, what Estate have I in a posset?


Forsooth, two Cowes you shall have with him.


With a Calf, to my knowledge.


Four Ewes and Lambs, and a Horse to ride to market on.


Yes, and an A -- No, now I think on it, you may keep your Ass your self.


Four Mark in money.


Do you mark that?


With a Bed and Blankets.


And then we may dance the shaking of the sheets when we can.


These promises are fair; and if performed, I hope I shall not need repent my
bargain


Nor I neither: Come, let us to bed presently, and afterward we'll talk on it.


No, no; first to Church, and then to bed.


Oh! then you will not follow the fashion of our Country; we commonly go to bed
first, and to Church when we can: but come, I am contented


What should this mean? Doll has a Hat on: she did not use to wear one.


Oh Gentlemen! though I desire your company, yet now I could heartily wish your
absence


Why? what is the matter, Doll?


I am married.


To whom?


Do you not know him? Young Simpleton the Smith.


That Fool, that Coxcomb: I Will break his Hammer with his own jolt-head.


Stand close, I hear him coming.


Sweetheart, now we are married, things ought to be well carried: and the
first thing we should take care for, is, how to get Victuals. What Is that


Nothing but the Rats and Mice.


As sure as I live, I Will lay a trap for those Rats. But what is the matter now?


Nothing but the Neighbors Dogs.


It Is a thousand pities but such Curs were hanged up presently.


Oh Gentlemen, I would you were out of the House; for I am afraid he will
return again ere I can handsomely shut the door


Why Doll, Doll!


Come ye behind me presently; I pray dispatch.


Doll, I have considered, that to set up my Trade is the way to get Victuals;
and I want nothing of my Tools, but only a pair of Bellows


Fear not, Husband, I have a little money that you know not of; and if I can
but hear of a good bargain, I will not fail to buy a pair of Bellows


Oh thou pretty loving kind Pigsnie! but what makes thee wear thy Coats of
that fashion


Do not you know, Husband, it is the fashion (...) new-married Wives?


Is it so? it is an excellent fashion in the Summertime: but I Will go out, and
return presently


What will you do? it is ten to one he spies you, and then my reputation runs a
hazard


Appoint what way you will, we are contented.


I see him coming back; and truth to say, the course I shall advise, will seem
a strange one, yet it must be: you know he did appoint that I should buy for
him a pair of Bellows; now if you two can beat it lustily, and blow it
strongly, this visit may be kept off from his knowledge


Nay, any thing, good Doll; we cannot now be chusers.


So, lie down: I Will fetch a Chafingdish of Charcoal hither, and practice you a
while before he come


I have played many a mad prank in my Life, yet never till now acted a pair of
Bellows


So, so, blow lustily, and fear not.


Wife, I have considered with my self, that if we lay out all the money in a
pair of Bellows, we should have little or nothing left to buy Victuals


Oh Husband, you are deceived; for I have bought you a pair of Bellows, the
whole Town shows not a neater


Is this a pair of Bellows? let me see, this is an a-la-moda pair of Bellows.
But look you, Doll, when the Bellows-mender comes by, let him stop this hole
here; for the wind comes out abominably. I Will call my Father Simpleton to see
this pair of Bellows. Father, father, come hither


Did you ever see such a pair of Bellows as my Wife has bought?


A pair a Bellows, Son! Methinks this would serve better for an Anvil: Let Us
try how it will bear our strokes


Well, a match.


WHy, what is the matter?


Nay, I know not: but every day my great Guts and my small Guts make such a
Combustion in my Belly as passes, and my Puddings (like Lances) run a-tilt at
my heart, and make me as queasie-stomacht as a young Green Sickness Girl newly
come to a Big-belly


Can thou not guess the reason of this trouble?


Yes, I think I can, and I Will be judged by thee, if my case be not desperate; I
have a horrible mind to be in love


With whom?


With any body; but I cannot find out the way how to be in Love.


Why? I Will instruct thee: Can thou be melancholy?


Yes, as a Dog, or a Hog-louse: I could even find in my heart to cry presently.


Can thou sleep well?


I cannot tell, I never saw my self sleep.


Is It possible, that thou who have so long been an attendant upon my Lord
Actaeon, should be to learn the way to be in love


I would it were not possible, on the condition thou were hanged and quartered.


I thank you, Sir. But Bumpkin, list to me;
This day thou know the Maids and Young Men meet
To sport, and revel it about the May Pole;
Present thy self there; tell thy cause of grief;
And I dare warrant thee a Sweetheart presently.

If thou can do that, I Will marry her first, and learn to love her afterward.


Haste thither, Bumpkin; I Will go on before.


And I will follow thee a Dog-trot.

Is it not pity* that a Man of Authority as I am, having been chief Dog-keeper
to my Lord Actaeon this five years, being a Man so comely of person, and having
such a pure Complexion, that all fair Ladies may be ashamed to look on me, and
that I should be distressed for a Sweetheart? May Pole, I come

And if the Wenches there increase my pains,
And scorn to love, I Will beat out all their brains.

Is it possible, would Bumpkin be in love?


Yes, if he knew but how; and for that sickness
I have undertaken to become his Doctor:
For, at the May-pole-meeting it is decreed,
A Sweetheart must be purchased, come what will on it.

Nay, if he be distressed, twenty to one he may find charitable Persons there.

Come, strike up a Farewell to Misfortune.


That is a Dance that I could never hit of: pray desist a while, and hear my
doleful Tale


He Will make us cry sure.


Be it known unto all men by these presents.


An Obligation? we will be no witnesses.


Why then I Will hang my self.


We will be witness then.


What, to my hanging? Of My Conscience, if I should woo my heart out, I should
never be the fatter for it. -- Where Is your promise now


You have not yet expressed your self; be plain; tell them your grief, a remedy
will follow


If that be all, it is but an easy matter; pray take notice that I am in love
-- with some body


Would I were she!


Why? so you are, if you have a mind to it.


Why then you are my own.


Pardon me, Sister, I bespake him yesterday.


Yes marry did she.


But I was she that won him at the Maypole.


Was that the cause you strove so for the Garland?


What Is that to you?

Would I had any one of them in quietness.


But yet I must have share.


So must I too.


I will not part without the better half.


Then who shall have me whole? what, are you mad?


There Is reason for a madness in this case.


I will not loose my right: Let go, I say.


He shall be mine, or else he shall be nothing.


Away you Burrs, why do you stick thus on me?
Now by this hand, if nothing can persuade you,
I Will drown my self for spite, that you may perish.

Hark, hark, my Lord Actaeons warning-piece;
That Horn gives us intelligence he does intend
To spend this day in hunting: Bumpkin, why stay you?
The hounds will quarrel with you: we'll come after.

Will you not stay, my Love?


I Will see you hanged first; and by this hand, ere I will be in love again, I
will feed my hounds with my own proper carcass


Now he is gone, our dancing may go forward.


My Lord Actaeon stays; be quick, I pray.


Quick as you will; the doing of it quick, makes it show the better.


Be nimble, Sirrah.


Nimble? yes, as a Bear that has been lug'd to purpose: if Love be such a
troublesome Companion, I will entreat him to keep out of my company


We consume the day.


They have saved me a labor.


Fie, what mean you?
The glory of this day calls us to action.

Sir, you may please to know, that yesternight I lodged a Boar within the
neighboring Forest


Yes, Sir, and I lodged a Fox at a house hard by.


BLind Cupid has made my heart for to bleed:
Fa la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

But I know a man can help you at need:
With a fa la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

My husband he often a hunting goes out:
Fa la, la, etc.

And brings home a great pair of horns, there is no doubt:
With a fa la, la, la, etc.

How is it, Monsieur Simpkin? why are you so sad?
Fa la, la, la, etc.

I am up to the ears in love, and it makes me stark mad:
With a fa la, la, la, etc.
I am vexed, I am tortured, and troubled at heart:
Fa la, la, etc.

But I Will try my skill to take off your smart:
With a fa la, la, etc.
And on that condition I give you a kiss:
Fa la, la, etc.

But what says your husband when he hears of this?
With a fa la, la, etc.

You know my affections, and no one knows more:
Fa, la, la, etc.

'Uds niggers noggers who knocks at the door?
With a fa, la, la, etc.

There is a Royster at the Door,
he seems a Fellow stout.

I do beseech you, worthy Friend,
which is the back-way out?

He swears and tears he will come in,
and nothing shall him hinder.

I fear he will strip me out my skin,
and burn it into Tinder.

I have considered of a way,
and 'twill be sure the best.

What may it be, my dearest Dear?


Creep into this same Chest.
And though he roar, speak you no word,
if you will preserve my favor.

Shut to the Chest, I pray, with speed;
for something has some savor.

I never shall be quiet if
she use me in this fashion.

I am here to bid you welcome;
what mean you by this passion?

With some young sweet-fac'd Fellow,
I thought gone out you were.

No sooth, the sweet-fac'd Fellow
is kept a Prisoner here.

Where is the Fool thy Husband?
say, whither is he gone?

The Wittal is a hunting.


Then we two are alone.
But should he come, and find me here, what might the Cuckold think?
Perhaps he would call the Neighbors in.

And beat you till you stink.


Yet in the bloody War full often, my courage I did try.


I know you have killed many a man.


You lie, you Slut, you lie.


I never came before a Foe,
By night nor yet by day,
But that I stoutly roused my self.

And nimbly ran away.


Within this Chest I Will hide my self, if it chance he should come.


O no, my Love, that cannot be.


I have bespoke the room.


I have a place behind here, which yet is known to no man.


She has a place before too, but that is all too common.


Wife, wherefore is the door thus barred? what mean you, pray, by this?


Alas, it is my Husband.


I laugh now till I piss.


Open the Chest, I Will into it, my Life else it may cost.


Alas, I cannot open it.


I believe the Key is lost.


I have bethought my self upon a dainty trick.


What may it be, my dearest Love?
I prithee now be quick.

You must say that your Enemy into this house is fled;
And that your heart can take no rest until that he be dead.
Draw quickly out your furious Blade, and seem to make a strife:
Swear all the excuses can be made, shall not preserve his Life.
Say that the Rogue is fled in here, that stole away your Coin;
And if I Will not deliver him, you will have as much of mine.

Here Is no man but my self, on whom shall I complain?


This great fool does not understand, this thing you must but seign.
My husband thus must be deceived, and afterward we'll laugh.

Wife, since you will not open the Door,
I Will break't open with my staff.

Good woman show me to the Slave, his limbs I strait will tear.


By all the honesty I have, there is no man came in here*


When I have fought to purchase wealth, and with my blood did win it,
This Rogue has got my purse by stealth.

But never a penny in it.


She Is big with Child, therefore take heed you do not fright my wife.


But know you who the Father is?


The Roarer, on my Life.


She knows not of your enemy, then get you gone you were best.


Peace, husband, peace; I tell you true*
I have hid him in the Chest.

I am glad on it at my heart, but do not tell him so.


I would not for a thousand pound the Roarer should it know.


When next we meet, his life is gone, no other must he hope;
I Will kill him whatsoere comes on it.

Pray think upon a Rope.


What kind of person is it then, that in the Chest does lie?


A goodly handsome sweet young man, as ere was seen with eye.


Then let us both entreat of him --
Pray put us not in fear:
We do beseech you go from hence.

But tomorrow I Will be here.


Wife, run with all the speed you can, and quickly shut the door;
I would not that the roaring Man should come in any more.
Mean time I will release the youth, and tell him how we have sped --
Be comforted my honest friend.

Alas, I Am almost dead.
My heart is tortured in my breast, with sorrow, fear and pain.

I Will fetch some Aqua vitae, to comfort you again.


And 'cause I will require you, whose love does so excel,
I Will graft a pair of horns on your head* that may defend it well.

Good husband, let the man stay here, it is dangerous in the street.


I would not for a Crown of Gold the Roarer should him meet.
For should he come by any harm, they would say the fault were mine.

There Is half a crown, pray send him out to fetch a quart of wine.


There Is money for you, Sir, -- pray fetch a quart of Sack.


It Is well, it is well, my honest friend,
I Will see you shall not lack.

But if he should dishonest me, for there are such slippery men.


Then he gets not of his half crown, one penny back again.


Thy husband being gone, my Love, we'll sin^ we'll dance and laugh:
I am sure he is a good fellow, and takes delight to quaff.

I Will fold thee in my arms, my Love, no matter for his listening.


Gentlemen, some forty weeks hence you may come to a Christning.


O Sirrah, have I caught you? now do the best you can;
Your Schoolmaster never taught you to wrong an honest man.

Good Sir, I never went to school, then why am I abused?
The truth is, I am but a Fool, and like a Fool am used.

Yet Sirrah you had wit enough to think to Cuckold me.


I jested with him, husband, his knavery to see.


But now you talk of knavery,
I pray where is my sack?

You shall want it in your belly, Sir, and have it on your back.


WHat Paper is that he ruminates upon? Let us observe a little.


It Is a strange thing I find my self out every day more then other, to be one
of the understanding'st, sweetest, neatest, and compleatest Shepherds that ever
took hook in hand. The Other day I saw my face in a pail of water, and I had much
ado to forbear drowing of my self. It Is no wonder then, that the beauteous
Nymph Oenone makes much of me, and lets all the other Shepherds shake their
Ears like Asses: and the truth is, if I can find never a handsomer, she shall
serve the turn. This was her birthday, she being born in the year -- one
thousand six hundred, -- nay hold a little: but on this day of the month it
was, VVinter or Summer, in the honor of which we all keep holiday: and
therefore for the credit of her beauty, and the honor of my own Poetry, I have
made such a Copy of Verses on her, as will make her a thousand times handsomer
then ever she was in her Life

I will peruse them now with the eyes of understanding.

OEnone fair, whose beauty does enrich us,
Tell me the cause why thou do so bewitch us.
On this day thou were born, though not begotten;
This day I Will think on when thou art dead and rotten.
And though thy coyness, and thy pretty scorn,
Makes many wish that thou had never been born;
Yet for my own part, this I Will swear and say,
I wish thy time of birth were every day.
If she do not run mad for love of me now, it is pity she should have Verses
made on her as long as she lives


Let Us interrupt him. -- Hobbinal, well met.


It may be so.


But why so strange, man? I hope you will remember we are your fellow-Shepherds.


You were once: but now I command you to know, I am a Master-Shepherd; for the
fair Nymph Oenone, that makes all your mouths run over with water, does
acknowledge me to be both Master and Mistress


In part it is true: yet if you well consider, she makes you but her sport; no
otherwise


If she make me her sport, it is more then ever she can make of thee: for thou
art one of the sowrest looked fellows that ever crept out of a Vinegar-bottle


Here comes the fairest Idae ever nourisht.


Now will I see who is the most deserving Shepherd in all the Vale of Idae. --
Little Rogue, how do thou


O Hobbinal, you are welcome; I thought you had forgot me: you are my sport,
and should be ever near me


Look you there, I am her sport, she says: when will she give any of you such
an honorable Title? but Sport, I do not think but thou art a Conjurer, or a
VVitch, or a Devil at least: for thou have insused such a combustion of Poetry
in my head, that I fear I shall never be my own Man again, nor my Master's
neither. -- There Is a Copy of Verses, read 'em: nay, they are my own, as sure
as my name 's Hobbinal


I thank you, Sport: I Will study a requital.


Honor me with your fair hand, Nymph, that I may lead the way to all those
pastimes which will follow


The honor is to me, and I accept it.


I Would laugh at that: no, Sport, I Will dance with thee my self.


Some other time by chance I may be at leisure.


Will you not? Well, by this hand then I Will stand out, and laugh at every
thing you do, right or wrong

Pshaw waw, this dancing is like my Mothers Mares trot:
Sport, shall I show thee a Dance of my own fashion?

It cannot but content.


Nay, I know that: hark hither, Lads.


How like you this Sport?


Beyond Expression, Sport: I see your Virtues were concealed too long.


I, so they were; but I mean to show them every day as fast as I can. But
Sirrah, Sport, yonder is god Pan with a company of the bravest Satyrs that ever
wore horns on their heads: come, Shepherds, let us go make them drunk, and saw
off all their horns


HEreabout I am to meet this Hercules; and see, he is come.

Well, John, I see you are prepared for murder: have mercy on the Barber, I say.


No, I scorn it; I will have no mercy: he has made a whore of a wondrous honest
woman; and a Cuckold of one, that for ought I know, might have been a Courtier.
For which abominable deed, I scorn to show my self a Christian; for I do mean
to use him worse then a Jew would


Nay, but consider, he is a man however, and you can boast your self to be no
more, although you have the spirit of a Giant: you have brought weapons here,
as if you meant to kill him twenty times. Troth it is too much


If I bate him an Ace of forty, call me Coxcomb: I will draw his teeth one by
one, with an instrument called a pair of Tongs, then let him blood in the right
vein, and bid the Devil take him at his own peril


Let me prevail with thee to calm thy rage, and take acquaintance of this
Gentleman, a worthy friend of mine


Do you long to be acquainted with me, Sir?


By any means, Sir.


It Is granted then: I Will toss a Can or a Pot with you as soon as I have
dispatched this bawdy Barber; would he were dead, that my business might be over


What Is your profession, Sir? and how may I call you?


I am a Seaman, Sir; my name's John Swabber: -- an Officer of the Ship, Sir.


I cry you mercy, Sir.


Nay, never cry for the matter. -- But I had forgot this Barber all this while.
Barber, come forth; or by the beard of my great Grandfather, I swear, I will so
shashado, mashado, pashado, and carbinado thee, that thou shall look like a
Gallimafry all the days of thy Life. Come forth, I say


Why Neighbor Swabber, who provokes you thus? what do you mean? who has
offended you


O Slave of all Slaves! who has offended me? why thou base, beastly,
boisterous, Babylonian, bawdy-fac'd Barber, thou have: thou have made me fit to
chew the cud with Oxen, climb the mountains with wild Goats, and keep company
with none but Ram-headed people: for which I will tie thee up on the next
Signepost, and there thou shall hang a twelvemoneth and a day alive, for an
example to all such notable shavers; but if thou come and submittest to my
mercy, I will do thee the favor to let thee hang till thou be dead


Francisco, hark: -- I Will pawn my Life this fellow is a rank Coward: keep you
his fury up, and I Will persuade the Barber to a greater vein of roaring then ere
was practiced by a suburb-Blade: I Will make him at the least seem valiant; fear
not


Do, if it be possible; I Will hold him in discourse. -- But, Mr. Swabber, what
think you if he does compound with you? will you be won to take an arm or two,
or both his legs, and save his other members


Pish, tell not me, it is neither his arms nor his legs that I stand upon; he
has caused me to go in danger of my Life: for the other day I had an occasion
to pass by a worshipful Gentleman's pack of Hounds, they no sooner looked upon
my forehead, but they came at me in full cry; and I for fear left such a sent
behind me, that they came after me as perfectly by it, as if I had been a
Stagg; and if I had not got shelter of a house, without doubt I had been
presented to some great man for Venison, and my Hanches had been baked by this
time


You were in danger there, I must confess.


And the Butchers Dogs still take me for a Bull, and fetch such courses at me;
and all this the Barber is the cause of


I would revenge it: were I as you, he should not have a tool left him to work
with


No, nor to play with neither: I will have an inch of every tool he has. --
Barber, come forth, and let me kill thee upon fair terms; or else I mill enter
thy house by force, pitch thee down the stairs, and send thee of an Errand
headlong: and if thou do submit to my mercy, I will shave thee to death with
thy own Rasor: therefore take heed. -- So, now let him come if he dare


Well, now I see there is no hope to appease him: blood must ensue, and death
will take its course


With whom? what is the matter?


The Barber is preparing for the combat: he has took his pole to serve him for
a lance, and one of his basins for a buckler, and vows to make you the
windmill, whilst he plays Don Quixot against you furiously


A windmill! -- I Will be gone.


You will not offer that, sure. What afraid?


Would it not make any one tremble with the thought on it, first to be made a
Cuckold, then a windmill? No, I will be gone, and come again to kill him when I
can find him in a better humor


Consider what you do; he will call you Coward, proclaim you Cuckold still in
every Alehouse; and what disgrace will that be


I care not: it is better to be a Cuckold then a windmill. If he had meant to
make a Fool, a Puppy, or an Ass of me, or any such Christian-like Creature,
'twere another matter: but to be made a windmill of, and never to be respected
but when the wind blows, is not to be endured: therefore let him make
wind-mills of my weapons, if he will; for my own part, I will defend my self
with my heels


Come, I have brought him to a better temper: he will come armed with nothing
but a Razor; with which if he does s^it your wezand-pipe, it will not be amiss
to take it patiently


Let him not spoil my drinking, and I care not: but hark you, if you should
let him hurt me, I should be as angry as a Tygre


Where is this Slave that has provoked my rage to his destruction? I will
swinge this Boor, then hang him up for Bacon in my chimney, and send him to be
broyled for Pluto's breakfast


Why this is worse then to be made a windmill. Do you hear, Sir? if ever you
had the fit of an Ague upon you, or ever knew the trembling of a Man troubled
in Conscience, that would be loath to die till he had made even with all the
world, consider me. Alas, Sir, I have my Rent to pay yet; and if I should be
sent to Hell of an Errand, they will like my company so well, I should never come
back again: pray persuade him to send me to Jerusalem, Jericho, or any of those
places nearer hand


Why, can not thou excuse thy self? where is thy brains?


Alas, my brains are fallen into my breeches; but if you will stand between me
and harm, I Will venture to reconcile my self to him. -- Cut. -- honest Cutbeard,
did not thou think I was in earnest all this while


VVhatere thou were, thou shall be nothing presently: Death waits for thee:
come quickly, I command thee


Sir, pray persuade Mr. Death to have patience for a matter of 40 or 50 years
more: for I have a great deal of business to do in this world yet


Shall I be dallied with? let me approach him: for all the entreaties of the
world shall not preserve him past six minutes


One minute is past already, -- and there is two.


Nay, prithee Cutbeard be more merciful.


Three -- four -- five.


Will no entreaty serve? Then take your course.


Six. O now I am gone.


If he submit, he may live: let him know it. -- Do thou acknowledge thy own
Cowardice, and my heroic Valor


O mighty Hercules, I confess my self a Pigmy, and I will never think otherwise
while I live, these Gentlemen be my witnesses


Why then all is well a genesis -- Remember, Cutbeard.


I Will spice him, fear not. -- Give me thy hand,


Thus do I grasp thy friendship.


He grasps my hand devilish hard tho.


I here pronounce thy wife to be a Venus.


O rare! is my wife a Venus? That Is more then ever I knew before: why then I
will be her husband Cupid


No, Cupid was her Son.


It Is no matter for that, he shall be her husband for once; and we two will get
such abundance of young Cupids, that we'll make all the world in love with one
another


Since we are reconciled, know, honest Swabber, that I will make the whole
world dote on thee: I Will wash thy face, and powder thee to the purpose, and
shave thee if thou will too


No, by no means: I dare not venture my throat under thy Fingers: but for
washing and powdring, that all the world may be in love with me, I am content


Sit down then in this Chair, look on this powder, the snow is nothing to it;
'twill create such a complexion on thee, that no Art did ever set upon the
proudest Lady


But hark you, Cutbeard, how shall I do to satisfy all the women that will
follow me for kisses? if you make me too beautiful, my lips will be worn
threadbare before I can get home; and then Parnel my own dear wife, will have
the least share of her own sweet husband


For that we'll take a course -- wink, wink, good Jack; my Ball will search
your eyes else


My eyes are honest, and fear no searching.


Now I begin to sprucifie thy phisnomy: -- This powder was extracted from the
Phoenix, when she last burnt her self, and is indeed the quintessence of odours


Nay, it is as odious as ever I smelt, that is certain: good Cutbeard, let me
have enough, I prithee


Nay, I will spare no cost: -- Judge, Gentlemen, is he not strangely altered?


Past belief: I would not that my Mistress saw him now, my hopes would soon be
cooled then


I think so: but I would have you to take notice, I will have nothing to do but
with great personages; for I must not make my self common


What this fellow will come to, no man knows yet; his fame no doubt will
travel over all Countries, and I am fully resolved in my Opinion, the Queen of
Mauritania will run mad for him


If she run as mad as a March-Hare, she gets not a bit: no, Parnel and my
Neighbors shall have all


Now if the Painters will draw Adonis our, let them come here for Copies. So, I
have done


Prithee Cutbeard, lend me a Looking-glass.


By no means: what, did you never hear of one Narcissus, how he pined away for
love of his own shadow? No, go home, your house is hard by; let Parnel see you,
and bless her self with wonder


Honest Cutbeard, this Gentleman is a worthy friend of mine; prithee bestow
some of the same powder upon his face


No, no, you shall be beautiful alone; it is best.


Parnel, I come; and if thou be not stupid,
Thou '^t say Jack Swabber is a kin to Cupid.

Well, Cutbeard, thou have dressed him handsomely: I would give a Crown that I
were by when first he finds what beauty he is adorned withal


This day I am to meet with pretty Parnel; pray Heaven the Fool be absent when
I come: some two hours hence, if you will meet me, Gentlemen, I will tell you
how he takes his transmigration


We will not fail. Farewell.


I wonder that my Barber stays thus long: can he neglect me thus? Well, I will
fit him; for if he use me once again thus basely, I will cashier him, and bestow
my love upon some one more constant: forty to one but Swabber comes before him,
and spoils all

Who Is this, in the name of blackness? the clothes and walk of my dear husband,
and I will lay my life he has got a Vizard on. -- Nay pray now, indeed you will
fright me presently; take heed


She does not know me, that is excellent. -- Parnel, believe it, I am flesh and
blood; I would not have thee take me for a Goddess


A Goddess, quotha! a black one, if you be one: what have thou got upon thy
face, I prithee


Do not look too wistfully upon me, Parnel; my beauty will put your eyes out if
you do, and then I must be at the charge of a Dog and a Bell for you


A Dog and a fools head! pull off your Vizard.


Do not touch me, unless you make forty curtsies first. Come, kiss me, and thou will be out of thy wits presently


Nay, then I see it is a trick put upon him; I Will fetch you a glass, you shall
behold your beauty


Do, and I will venture to be in love with my self for once. How shall I
require honest Cutbeard? By this hand he shall have the honor to be Barber to
all my Wenches


Are you not wondrous fair? Look and admire your self.


O Parnel, Parnel, I am gulled most basely; I have not half so much beauty as a
Chimney-sweeper: I will kill the Barber the first thing I do


Was it the Barber used thee thus?


I* Parnel, 'twas he: I Will go fetch a company of my Fellow-saylors, drag him
out, and hang him up at the main-Yard presently. Parnel, farewell: if I be
apprehended for the death of Cutbeard, whatever thou do, send me a clean
shirt; for I shall have need on it


Well, Cutbeard, I commend thee for this project; thou have dressed him
handsomely: would thou were here, I would kiss thee for the Jests sake

Oh are you come, Sir?


I watch^ the time, my Parnel, and have found it: how does the Gull become his
feathers? Ha


As I would have him: Oh Cutbeard, this Kiss, and this, for the device.


Where is he, Parnel?


Why gone abroad in his new-fashion'd face, to fetch a gang of Saylors, who he
vows shall hang thee up at the main-Yard, and shall use thee worse then the
Prentices a Suburb-bawd on a Shrove-tuesday


And those same Water-rats are devilish things: what a Slave was I to use him
so


What can thou fear when I am in thy presence? Away, you Milk-sop, hence from
me, ^ayant


Nay, gentle Parnel, by this hand I will fight with a whole Army, if thou say
the word: prithee be reconciled


Why Parnel, Parnel! here is thy own sweet husband; open the door, dear Wife.


O me, my husband's come; what shall I do?


Let me into the Well, if thou think good; or hang me in the Chimney 'stead
of Bacon


Alas, that is full of hazard: -- No device!


Why huswife, huswife, must I wait half a day?


My Peticoat's fallen off; but I come presently. -- Oh I have thought, come
hither, put on this Biggin, I made it for my Child that is at Nurse, and cram
thy self into this Cradle here: there is no other way, therefore dispatch


O me! thou never think upon my beard; that will betray all presently.


Take you no care, I Will make him to believe you were born with it; be quick, I
say


Necessity compels me: send me off of this brunt once, I Will hunt the smock no
more. -- Cover me close, good Parnel


So, keep you close; and when he prattles to you, snee^e in his face, and call
him Dad; do you hear


Why you proud, peevish, petty, paltry Parnel, why did you make me stay so long?


I made what haste I could, but the Child cried so.


The Child! what Child? Have you got Bastards here?


Bastards? they are your own then: Simon's come home, the Boy I had a
twelvemoneth since by you: he was born when you were at Sea


Is he brought home? As I am an honest man I am glad on it. Let me see him,
Parnel


Look here he is; the goodliest Boy, and even as like thee, John, as if thou
had begot him all thy self


Whoop! here is a Boy of a twelvemoneth old: if he grow but thus much this next
year, he will be able to fight with a Giant presently. But Parnel, he has got a
great beard too, how comes that


Why he was born with it: many children are so; and it is a sign he will be a
man betimes, a wise discreet one too


Dad, dad, dad!


Nay, it is a wise Child, I perceive that; for he calls me Dad at first sight.
Good Parnel, fetch me some Milk for him; I will see him eat


He had Milk but just now: prithee, John, be patient.


You are a Fool, he has been starved at Nurse, and we must make him fat. Fetch
some, I say


I will not, truly John, you will spoil the Child.


I saw some stand in the next room, I will fetch it my self, so I will.


What will you do? you must endure with patience; I mingled batter but just
now for pancakes, and that he will bring, as certain as I live


I shall be crammed to death: mercy upon me.


He comes, lie close again.


Dad, dad, dad!


I, mine own Boy, here is Milk for thee, Simon.

Look, Parnel, look how greedily he eats it.


Now fie upon you, John, you will choke the Child.


I mean to make him grow as high as Paul's* and show him for a wonder in
Bartholomew Fair. Fetch me some Milk, this is all gone


What, do you think I will murder the poor Infant?


By this hand I will go to the Milk-woman and fetch him a whole gallon.


Up quickly, and be gone; for when he comes, he will choke you without fail.


A pox upon him, never was Child fed thus. But what will you do now?


Do not you fear; I Will fetch my own Child; it is at a Neighbors house, and say
the Fairies have exchanged it


Send thee good luck: Farewell, sweet Parnel.


So, if this Child will serve him for a Simon, all will be well again.

He comes. -- Oh John.


Come, give me Simon on my Lap; I will feed him till his Guts crack again.


Alas, I went but in the next room, and in the mean time the Fairies have
exchanged him; look what a little thing they have left in his place


I will have none on it: go, fetch me Simon; and tell the Fairies I will indi^e
them at the Sessions for this. Oh Simon, Simon, what is become of thee


Nay, prithee take not on so.


The goodliest Boy of his age that ever man saw. Pshaw, this has never a beard:
I will have none on it


Why how now, Jack? what, in a passion? Ha, 'twas I that blackt thy face to
day for mirth sake, and thou did think it was Cutbeard


I care not for my face; Simon is gone, that had a beard as big as Cutbeard's
here: the Fairies have exchanged him, and look what a Chitty-face they have
left in his room; a thing of nothing for him


Come, you must use this they have left with courtesy, for they will whip
Simon every day in the week else: I know the nature of them


Will they so? Nay, then I must make much on it.


And now you must be friends with Cutbeard too.


With all my heart; for I am angry with none but the Fairies now.


We have brought Music, and some Neighbors with us, and mean to have a
Dance. Come, John


I can dance nothing but a melancholy Dance: for I am in a grievous dump for
Simon still


I warrant thee. Strike up there.


Why that is well done: no time is counted lost,

Where civil Mirth is gained with such small cost.


ME be content to have de litel patience, and be my trot, me tell you, vat me
have seen a to day, de fine sport in de Varle: me come into de Great Man to
day, me make de reverence Alamode, come ill faut, and he make me de strange a
Sir-reverence de tird time, dat ever you saw


Oh Monsieur, every Man has not the activity of your feet.


By my fat, it is very estrange a ding, dat dey vil suffer a des Men to be near
a de King, a de Queen, de Prince, or de Princess, dey vil marra de
understanding very mush


Why Monsieur, that lies at the other end.


Be gar you shall excuse a me, for de Conrtier Alamode dear de vit lie in de
foot; be gar dear is no body can be Eiseman, dat does not make a de most
excellent reverence, dat is most certain, dat is de best ting in de hole Varle


But do you think Caesar, or most of the Emperors or Worthies of the world,
studied the Liberal Science of the Foot, or puissant Toe


No; but be gar dat make them die all unfortunate: for if dey had tink but de
reverence, dey might a live a great a vile


I confess the wisdom of it, Sir; but for the wit, do you think that lies
there


Dat be de best vit can be possible: for your vit, vat is your vit? Your vit is
to break a de jest; vel, look you now a me, me vil break a de jest: Dat is
like dat a me Lor, dat is like a de Knight, dat is like dat a de Jentilman: Ha,
ha, ha! dear is now one, two, tree very good jest datmake a me sick wide laugh;
and be gar me vil make a de Page, de Lacquey, and all de fool in de Court,
break ades very good jest, very quickly, dat is nothing


To any purpose.


Be my trot me speak a to de King, and to de Queen to give me a Patten, dat
none shall teach a de Aldermen to make a de Reverence but my self; and me vil
undertake dat vit in one 12 a mont: but den dey must do noting else, dey shall
make a de Reverence, vit de Aldermen in de Paris, and dance a Coran, a
Cerebran, a Mountague, and dat vil be very brave


But what shall business do in the mean time, Monsieur?


Is not dis very great a business? Nay be gar, me vil undertake to de King, and
to de Queen, to make a my Lor Maire, de Sheriff and de Aldermen very fine a
mask


And to write it, Monsieur.


Aw, de write? dat is nothing alamode, your speesh two, tree yard long, pshaw?
Give a me de quick a Spirit, de Fancy, de brave Scene, de variety of de
Antimask, de nimble a Foot, no matter de sense, begar it vole be de brave ting
in de Christian varle


There is no question to be made.


And be my trot, if me have anoder Patten for de Council learned in de Law, for
to teash them de reverence, dat vil be very great vark; but my diligence and
skill in dat matre, have no despair to effect in time dis great benefit, and dat
vil make a de Law flourish, and Englan a brave Englan begar


But what will you look for now for your pains, Monsieur? that is considerable.


Begar me look for very mush; for it is mush pain, and it is brave ting: beside,
me look for a Statur of de brass in de Palace-yard, ven me go out of dis varle


You will deserve it as a rare Patriot. But what manner of Reverence would you
have the Lawyers to imitate? you must consider their Gravity


Observe a me.


Such a Reverence under your favor would not become.


Begar you no understand a de matre, vere is your brain? dear is noting in de
varle like a dat motion, for de Jentilman, and for de Jentilvoman


Yes, by your leave, Sir, there is something else that is as good for them.


I will tell you now, begar, here is a de Kinsman dat is a me, and he live here
very mush time, before he come, dey vent in vid deire Toes, and hold deire
Cloak in Stadere, and de Hat so. Fie, a la diable! and now dey valk vid deire
Toes out for brave Genty, you call dat a de splay-foot: but me vonder dat de
Lady no come, begar me no use to dis patience, and de vait: pray tell you Madam
dat me have autre business vid de Lor, and de autre Lady have de use of my foot
begar


Oh Monsieur, by no means: Sir William, let us prevail.


It Is no good you hold a me begar: me no stay two minutes to save a your soul,
dat is de resolution of de Cavalier de Franc


Would any man believe there should be so much folly in this Cubit-square?


Do you think he is a French Dancer? Let that answer you.


Monsieur Galliard, my Lady expects you.


Begar me no lik adat reverence, me vill change a dat.


It Is the French Fashion, as you taught me, Monsieur.


Ouy, it is de French Fashion, but de French Fashion is always to change, and
dis reverence displease a me very mush, because you go back, back vid your
buttock, as if some vod take you by dat, to vat me vill give a no name


Sweet Mris. Lucy.


Dat de reverence is no good of de man, me must change dat too: be me trot me
doubt dat dis great business vill almost break a my brain, dis great work, and
before a Masque of de King and de Queen. Me can eat a no meat, no drink, no
sleep, and me grow so very a lean vid de Contemplation, a so much be my trot de
Privy Council is no so mush troubled as me be vid dis: Oh te Diable! deirs is
noting, dey fit all de vile dey do deir business: me bissey bote head and de
foot cap a pie, in de French tune, and dat is great matre begar


You esteem it highly, Monsieur.


Me tell you, and me tell you no tale, It Is great matre to make a de Lor, to
make a d

Lady, to make a de Jentilman, to make a de Jentilwoman, and de autre man to
dance, and to make a de boon reverence, for begar dat vil make a de King de
great King in de Varle


How can that be, Sir?


Me tell you, ven dey are so bissey to learn a de dance, dey vill never tinke
of de Rebellion, and den de reverence is obedience to Monarchy, and begar
obedience is ale de ting in de Varle


But what Music would you govern the people by?


Begar by de best French Fiddles can be got.


What think you of an Irish Harp, a State-Organ, or a Passionate voice to a
Lovers Lute


Des dull tings make a de men melancholique, and den dey tinke on de Devil, and
de Treason, and do any ting dat is no good; but begar des French Fiddles do
fiddle all des tings out of deit head, vid such a jerk as ma ^oy make a them so
fantastical, and make a them as good subject as any is in de France, begar.
Here be one of my Colliers, Monsieur Simpleton, Say you no dat de French Fiddle
make a de brave Government in a de Varle


I say any thing becomes a Gentleman.


Observe you dat? he have been but two tree mont, and he say any ting dat is
brave. He have de grand understanding in de foot. Tell a me ven you hear a de
littel fiddel vat is your tink? is your head no free from de Treason, and de
plot of de Rebel as your leg? begar you no stand upon de ground for joy of de
Coran, de Cerebran, de Marquess, de Montague, ha! Me be your humble servant
Madam

and stay one two tree hours.


I am now ready for you Monsieur. Come Lucy, the practice of the last he taught
us


Wat Antique be dis?


Monsieur, ask that May Pole and he can dance.


Plait il Monsieur, a la Galliard de Coran, la Princess, le Buckingham, heigh?


Put up your rosin and your Cats-guts presently, and be gone, or I shall find a
grave for you in the pocket of my sleeve, and this shall be your winding sheet


Me no play dat lesson: Pocket de sleeve? dat is no tune de France: pocket, le
grand pock -- Pardonne moy Monsieur: Me put up my offers to strike him Fiddel
and be gone. Adieu Madam, Serviteur jentilhommes. Pocket de sleeve


NAy son,

If this be your regard.


Good Mother.


Good me no goods; your Cousin and your self are welcome to me whilst you bear
your selves like honest and true Gentlemen. Bring hither to my house, that has
ever been reputed a Gentlewoman of a decent and fair carriage, and so have
behaved my self


I know ye have.


Bring hither, as I say, to make my house stink in my neighbors nostrils, your
devices, your Brats got out of Alligant and broken Oaths? your linsey work,
your hasty puddings? I foster up your filch'd iniquities? you are deceived in me,
for I am none of those receivers


Have I not sworn unto you it is none of mine, and showed you how I found it?


Ye found an easy fool that let you get it: she had better have worn Posterons.


Will ye hear me?


Oaths? what do you care for oaths to gain your ends, when you are high and
pampered? what Saint know ye? or what Religion, but your purposed lewdness, is
to be looked for of ye? Nay, I will tell ye, ye will then swear like accused
Cut-purses? as far off truth too: and lie beyond all Faulconers. I Am sick to
see this dealing


Heaven forbid, Mother.


Nay, I am very sick.


Who waits there?


Sir?


Bring down the bottle of Canary wine.


Exceeding sick, Heaven help me.


I must even make her drunk. Nay, gentle mother.


Now fie upon ye.


Here mother, take a good round draught, 'twill purge spleen from your spirits:
deeper, mother


I, I, son; you imagine this will mend all.


All in faith, mother.


I confess this wine will do his part.


I Will pledge you.


But son John, I know your meaning.


Mother, touch it once more, alas you look not well; take a round draught, it
warms the blood well, and restores the color, and then we'll talk at large


A civil Gentleman! a stranger! one that should weigh his fair name! Oh, a
stitch


There Is nothing better for a stitch: good mother make no spare of it, as you
love your health: Mince not the matter


As I said, a Gentleman lodge in my house! now heaven's my comfort.


I looked for this.


Where Is the infant? come, let us see your workmanship.


None of mine, mother; but there it is, and a lusty one.


Heaven bless thee, thou had a hasty making; but the best is, it is many a
good man's fortune. As I live, your own eyes, Seignior, and the nether lip as
like ye, as if ye had spit it


I am glad on it.


Bless me, what things are these!


I thought my labor was not all lost; it is gold, and these are jewels, both
rich, and right I hope


Well, well, son John, I see you are a woodman, and can choose your Deer though
it be i'ch' dark; all your discretion is not yet loft, this was well clapped
aboard here: I am with you now, when, as they say, your pleasure comes with
profit, when you must needs do where ye may be done to; it is a wisdom becomes a
young man well. Be sure of one thing, loose not your labor and your time
together, it seasons of a fool. Son, time is precious, work wary whilst ye have
it. Since ye must traffic sometimes this slippery way, take sure hold,
Seignior, trade with no broken Merchants: make your lading as you would make
your rest, adventurously, and with advantage ever


All this time, mother, the child wants looking to, meat and Nurse.


Now blessing o'thy care, it shall have all, and instantly; I Will seek a Nurse my
self, son; it is a sweet child: Ah my young Spaniard, take you no farther care
sir


Yes, of these jewels I must, by your leave mother: these are yours, to make
your care the stronger; for the rest I Will find a master; the gold for bringing
up on it, I freely render to your charge


No more words, nor no more children (good son) as you love me, this may do
well


I shall observe your Morals.


Come, ye do know --


I do not, by this hand Mistress, but I suspect.


What?


That if eggs continue at this price, women will never be saved by their good
works


I will know.


Ye shall, any thing lies in my power. The Duke of Lorrain is now 7000 strong:
I heard it of a Fish-wife, a woman of fine knowledge


Sirrah, sirrah.


The Popes Bulls are broken loose too, and it is suspected they shall be baited
in England


Very well, Sir.


No, it is not so well neither.


But I say to you, Who is it keeps your Master company?


I say to you, Don John.


I say to you, what woman?


I say so too.


I say again, I will know.


I say it is fit you should.


And I tell thee he has a woman here.


And I tell thee, it is then the better for him.


You are no Baud now?


Would I were able to be called unto it. A worshipful Vocation for my Elders;
for as I understand, i^ is a place fitting my betters far


Was ever Gentlewoman so frumpt off with a Fool? Well, saucy sirrah, I will
know who it is, and for what purpose. I pay the rent, and I will know how my
house comes by these inflammations. If this geer hold, best hang a sign-post
up, to tell the Seigniors, here you may have Lewdness at liberty


'Twould be a great ease to your age.


How now? why what is the matter Landlady?


What Is the matter? ye use me decently among ye, Gentlemen.


Who has abused her? you sir?


Ods my witness, I will not be thus treated, that I will not.


I gave her no ill language.


Thou lie lewdly, thou tookst me up at every word I spoke, as I had been a
Mawkin, a Flutt-Gillian: And thou think, because tho^u can write and read,
our noses must be under thee


Dare you, sirrah?


She raves of Wenches, and I know not what, Sir.


Go to, thou know too-well, thou wicked Varlet.


As I live Sir, she is ever thus till dinner.


Get you in.


By this hand I Will break your posset-pan.


Then by this hood I Will lock the meat up.


Now your grief, what is it? for I can ghess.


Ye may with shame enough, if there were shame amongst ye; nothing thought on
but how you may abuse my house: not satisfied with bringing home your Bastards
to undo me, but you must drill your Whores here too? My patience (because I
beat and bear, and carry all, and as they say am willing to groan under) must
be your Make-sport now


No more of these words, nor no more murmurings, Lady: for you know that I know
something. I did suspect your anger; but turn it presently, and handsomely, and
bear your self discreet to this woman, for such a one there is indeed


It Is well, son.


Leaving your Devils Matins, and your Melancholies, or we shall leave our
lodgings


You have much need to use these vagrant ways, and to much profit: ye had that
might content you (at home, within your selves too) right good, Gentlemen,
wholesome, and ye said handsome. But you gallants, boast that I was to believe
you


Leave your suspicion: for as I live, there is no such thing.


Mine honor; and 'twere not for mine honor.


Come, your honor, your house, and you too, if you dare believe me, are well
enough. Sleek up your self, leave crying


Worshipful Lady, how does thy velvet scabbard? by this hand thou look most
amiably; now could I willingly, and 'twere not for abusing thy Geneva-Print
there, venture my body with thee


You will leave this roguery when you come to my years.


By this light, thou art not above fifteen yet, a mere girl; thou have not half
thy teeth --


Prithee John let her alone, she has been vexed already: she will grow stark mad.


I would see her mad. An old mad woman is like a Millers Mare troubled with
toothache. She Will make the rarest faces


Well Don John, there will be times again, when O good mother, what is good for
a Carnositie in the Bladder? O the green water, mother


Doting take ye, do you remember that?


She has paid you now, Sir.


Clarie, sweet mother, Clarie.


Are ye satisfied?


I Will never whore again, never give Petticoats and VVastcoats at five pounds
apiece; good mother, quickly mother. Now mock on, son


A devil grind your old chaps.


By this hand, VVench, I Will give thee a new hood for this. Has she met with
your Lordship


Touch-wood take her, she is a rare costly mother.


I have told you all I can; to me you seem a worthy woman, one of those are
seldom found in our sex, Wise, and Virtuous. Direct me, I beseech you


Ye say well, Lady, and hold to that point; for in these businesses a woman's
counsel that conceives the matter, Do ye mark me, that conceives the matter,
Lady, is worth ten men's engagements: she knows something, and out of that, can
work like wax; when men are giddy-headed, either out of wine, or a more
drunkenness, vain ostentation, discovering all: there is no more keep in 'um,
then hold upon an Eels tail; nay, it is held fashion to defame now all they can


I, but these Gentlemen --


Do not you trust to that: these Gentlemen are as all other Gentlemen, of the
same Barrel; I, and the self-same Pickle. Be it granted they have used ye with
respect and fair behavior yet since ye came: do you know what must follow?
They are Spaniards, Lady, Gennets of high mettle: Things that will thrash the
Devil or his Dam, let 'em appear but cloven


Now Heaven bless me!


Mad Colts will court the VVind: I know 'em, Lady, to the least hair they have;
and I tell you, old as I am, let but the pint-pot bless'em, they will offer to my
years


How! --


Such rude Gambols --


To you? --


I, and so handle me, that often I am forced to fight of all four for my safety:
There Is the younger, Don John, the arrantest Jack in all this City. The other,
Time has blasted, yet he will stoop, if not ore-flown, and freely on the
Quarrie: Has been a Dragon in his days. But Tarmont, Don Jenkin is the Devil
himself; the Dog Days the most incomprehensible VVhoremaster, twenty a night
is nothing; Beggars, Broom-women, and those so miserable, they look like
famine, are all sweet Ladies in his drink


He Is a handsome Gentleman, pity he should be master of such follies.


He Is never without a noise of Syrrenges in's pocket, those proclaim him,
Birding-pills, Waters to cool his Conscience, in small Viols; with thousand
such sufficient emblems. The truth is, whose Chastity he chops upon, he cares
not. He flies at all; Bastards upon my Conscience he has in making, multitudes;
The last night he brought home one, I pity her that bore it, but we are all
weak Vessels: some rich woman, (for Wise I dare not call her) was the mother,
for it was hung with jewels, the bearing-cloth no less then crimson-Velvet


How!


It Is true, Lady.


Was it a boy too?


A brave boy, deliberation and judgment showed in's begetting; as I Will say for
him, he is as well paced for that sport


May I see it?


You shall see it: but what do ye think of these men now you know 'em, and of
the cause I told ye of? I but tell you for your own good, and as you will find
it, Lady


I am advised.


No more words then; do that, and instantly.


I Will fit you for your frumps: she that is wise leaps at occasion first; the
rest pay for it


DIagoras, look to the doors better for shame, you let in all the world, and
anon the King will rail at me: by Jove, the King will have the Show i'^h' Court


Why do you swear so, my Lord? you know he will have it here.


By this light, if he be wise he will not.


And if he will not be wise, you are forsworn.


One may sweat his heart out with swearing, and get thanks on no side; I Will be
gone, look to it who will


My Lord, I will never keep 'em out: pray stay, your looks will terrify 'em.


My looks terrify 'em, you Coxcombly Ass you? I Will be judged by all the
company whether thou have not a worse face then I. --


I mean, because they know you and your office.


Office? I would I could put it off. I am sure I sweat quite through my office:
serve that will


He Is so humorous, -- hark, hark; there, there, so, so, cuds, cuds, what now?


Let him not in.


O my Lord, he must: is your

Lady placed?


Yes Sir, I thank you. My Lord Calianax, well met; your causless hate to me I
hope is buried


Who placed the Lady there, so near the presence of the King?


I did.


My Lord, she must not sit there.


Why?


The place is kept for a woman of more worth.


More worth then she? it mis-becomes your age and place to be so womanish;
forbear: what you have spoke, I am content to think the Palsy shook your
tongue to


Why '^is well if I stand here to place men's Wenches?


I shall forget this place, thy age, and through all, cut that poor sickly
Week thou have to live, away from thee


Nay, I know you can fight for your Whore.


Bate the King, and he be flesh and blood, he lies that says it: thy mother at
fifteen was black and sinful to her


I, you may say your pleasure.


What vild injury has stirred my worthy friend, who is as slow to fight with
words as he is quick of hand


That heap of age which I should reverence if it were temperate; but testie
years are most contemptible


Good Sir forbear.


There is just such another as your self.


He will wrong you or me, or any man, and talk as if he had no life to lose.


How now huswifes? what, at your ease? is this a time to sit still? Up, you
young lazy whores, up, or I Will s^inge you


Nay, good my Lord.


You Will lie down shortly; Get you in and work: what, are you grown so restie?
you want ears; we shall have some of the Court-boys do that office


My Lord, we do no more then we are charged; it is the Ladies pleasure we be
thus in grief: she is forsaken


There Is a rogue too, a young dissembling slave; well, get you in, I Will have a
bout with that boy, it is high time now to be valiant. I confess my youth was
never prone that way: what, made an Ass? a Court-Stale? Well, I will be
valiant, and beat some dozen of these whelps, I will: and there is another of
'em, a trim cheating Soldier, I Will mawl that Rascal; has out*brav'd me twice,
but now I thank the gods I am valiant: Go, get you in, I Will take a course with
all


O Melantius, my daughter will die.


Trust me, I am sorry; would thou had ta'n her room.


Thou art a Slave, a Cutthroat Slave, a bloody treacherous Slave.


Take heed, old Man, thou will be heard to rave, and lose thine offices.


I am valiant grown at all these years, and thou art but a Slave.


Leave: some company will come, and I respect thy years, not thee so much,
that I could wish to laugh at thee alone


I Will spoil your mirth, I mean to fight with thee; there lie my Cloak, this was
my fathers sword, and he durst fight; are you prepared


Why? will thou dote thy self out of thy life? hence, get thee to bed, have
careful looking to, and eat warm things, and trouble not me; my head is full of
thoughts more weighty then thy life or death can be


You have a name in War, when you stand safe amongst a multitude; but I will
try what you dare do unto a weak old Man in single fight; you will ground I
fear. Come, draw


I will not draw, unless thou pull'st thy death upon thee with a stroke:
there is no one blow that thou can give, has strength enough to kill me.
Tempt me not so far then; the power of earth shall not redeem thee


I must let him alone, he is stout and able; and to say the truth, however I may
set a face and talk, I am not valiant. When I was a youth, I kept my credit
with a testie trick I had amongst Cowards, but durst never fight


I will not promise you to preserve your life if you do stay.


I would give half my land that I durst fight with that proud man a little: if
I had men to hold, I would beat him till he ask me mercy


Sir, will you be gone?


I dare not stay, but I will go home and beat my servants all over for this.


This old Man haunts me; but the distracted carriage of mine Amintor takes
deeply on me, I will find the cause: I fear his Conscience cries, he wronged
Aspatia


Good my Lord, forget your spleen to me; I never wronged you, but would have
peace with every man


It Is well: if I durst fight, your tongue would lie at quiet.


You Are touchie without cause.


Do, mock me.


By mine honor.


Honor? where is it?


See what stairs you make into your hatred, to my love and freedom to you. --
I come with resolution to obtain a suit of you


A suit of me? it is very like it should be granted, Sir.


Nay, go not hence: It Is this, You have the keeping of the Fort, and I would
wish you, by the love you ought to bear unto me, to deliver it into my hands


I am in hope that thou art mad, to talk to me thus.


But there is a reason to move you to it. I would kill the King, that wronged
you and your daughter


Out Traitor!


Nay, but stay; I cannot escape, the deed once done, without I have this Fort.


And should I help thee? Now thy treacherous mind betraies it self.


Come, delay me not, give me a sudden answer, or already thy last is spoke:
refuse not offered love when it comes clad in secrets


If I say I will not, he will kill me; I do see it writ in his looks: and
should I say I will, he will run and tell the King. I do not shun your
friendship, dear Melantius, but this cause is weighty, give me but an hour to
think


Take it, -- I know this goes unto the King, but I am armed.


Methinks I feel my self but twenty again, this fighting Fool wants policy. I
shall revenge my Girl, and make her red again. I pray my legs will last that
pace that I will carry, I shall want breath before I find the King


It sounds incredible.


Yes, so does every thing I say, of late.


Not so, Calianax.


Yes, I should sit mute, whilst a rogue with strong arms cuts your throat.


Well, I will try him.


Why, if it be alie, mine ears are false, for I Will be sworn I heard it. Old men
are good for nothing; you were best to put me to death for hearing, and free
him for meaning of it; you would have trusted me once, but the time is altered


And will still, where I may do it with Justice to the world. You have no
witness


Yes, my self.


No more, I mean, there were that heard it.


How, no more? why am not I enough to hang a thousand Rogues?


But so you may hang honest men too, if you please.


I may, '^is like I will do so; there are a hundred will swear it for a need
too, if I say it


Such witnesses we need not.


And it is hard if my word cannot hang a boisterous Knave.


Enough: if he should desire the Combat of you, it is not in the power of all
our Laws to hinder it


Why, if you do think it is fit an old Man and a Counselor to fight for what
he says, then you may grant it


Give me a bowl of wine: Melantius, I am now considering how easy 'twere for
any man to trust to poison one of us in such a bowl


I think it were not hard, Sir, for a Knave.


Such as you are.


Have you thought of this, Calianax?


Yes marry have I.


And what is your resolution?


Ye shall have it soundly.


Yet I wonder much of the strange desperation of these men; he could not escape
that did it


Were he known, unpossible.


It would be known, Melantius; I should think no man could kill me and sc^pe
clear, but that old Man


But I! Heaven bless me, I? should I, my Liege?


I do not think thou would, but yet thou might, for thou have in thy hands
the means to escape, by keeping of the Fort; he has, Melantius, and he has kept
it well


From Cobwebs, Sir, it is clean swept.


I shall be sure of your good word; but I have kept it safe from such as you.


Melantius, to show you my ears are every where, You meant to kill me, and get
the Fort to escape


You preserve a race of idle people here about you, Eaters, and Talkers, to
defame men's worths; Give me a pardon (for you ought to do it) to kill him that
spoke this


I, that will be the end of all; then I am fairly paid for all my care and
service


That old Man that calls me enemy, and of whom I (thought I will never match
my hate so low) have no good thought, would yet I think excuse me, and swear he
thought me wronged in this


Who I? thou shameless fellow, did thou not speak to me of it thy self?


O, then it came from him.


From me? who should it come from, but from me?


Nay, I believe your malice is enough, but I ha* lost my anger. Sir, I hope you
are well satisfied


Melantius, I held it great injustice to believe thine enemy, and did not; if
I did, I do not: let that satisfy


A few fine words have overcome my truth. Ah, thou art a Villain.


Why thou will let me have the Fort, Dotard; I will disgrace thee thus for
ever: there shall no credit lie upon thy words: think better, and believe it


My Liege, he is at me now again to do it; speak, deny it if thou can? Example
him whilst he is hot, for he will cool again, he will forswear it


This is Lunacy I hope, Melantius?


He has lost himself much: and though he call me Foe, I pity him; for it
becomes both you and me too, to forgive distraction: Pardon him as I do


I Will not speak for thee, for all thy cunning; if you will be safe, chop off
his head, for there was never known so impudent a Rascal


Some that love him, get him to bed.


Calianax, the King believes you; come, you shall go home and rest, you have
done well; you will give it up when I have used you thus a Month I hope


Now, now, it is plain Sir, he does move me still; he says, he knows I will
give him up the Fort, when he has used me thus this Month; I am mad, am I not
still


Ha, ha, ha!


I shall be mad indeed, if you do thus; why would you trust a sturdy fellow
there, (that has no virtue in him, all is in's sword) before me? do but take his
weapons away from him, and he is an Ass, and I am a very Fool, both with him and
without him, as you use me


Ha, ha, ha!


It Is well, Calianax; but if you use this once again, I shall entreat some
other to see your offices be well discharged. Good Calianax sleep soundly, it
will bring thee to thy self


Sleep soundly! I sleep soundly now, I hope, I could not be thus else! How
dare thou stay alone with me, knowing how thou have used me


You cannot blast me with your tongue, and that is the strongest part you have
about you


I do look for some great punishment for this, for I begin to forget all my
hate, and take it unkindly that mine enemy should use me so extraordinarily
scurvily


I shall melt too, if you begin to take unkindness; I never meant you hurt.


Thou Wilt anger me again; thou wretched rogue, meant me no hurt? disgrace me
with the King, lose all my offices? this is no hurt, is it? I prithee what do
thou call hurt


To poison me because they love me not; to call the credit of Men's wives in
question, to murder children betwixt me and land; this is all hurt


All this thou think is sport, for mine is worse; but use thy will with me,
for betwixt grief and anger I could cry


Be wise then, and be safe; thou may revenge.


I of the King? I would revenge o'thee.


That you must plot your self.


I am a fine Plotter.


The short is, I will hold thee with the King in this perplexity, till
peevishness, and thy disgrace has laid thee in the grave. But if thou will
deliver up the Fort, I Will take thy trembling body in my arms, and bear thee
over dangers; thou shall hold thy wonted state


If I should tell the King, can thou deny't again?


Try and believe.


Nay, then thou can bring any thing about; thou shall have the Fort.


Why well, here let our hate be buried.


Nay, I do not love thee yet; I cannot well endure to look on thee. And if I
thought it were a courtesy, thou should not have it; but I am disgraced, my
offices are to be ta'n away. And if I did but hold this Fort a day, I do
believe the King would take it from me, and give it thee, things are so
strangely carried; Never thank me for it: but yet the King shall know there was
some such thing in it I told him of, and that I was an honest man


He Will buy that knowledge very dearly. What news with thee?


This were a night indeed to do it in.


Go, Diphilus, and take from this good man, my worthy friend, the Fort, he will
give it thee


Ha'you got that too?


Art thou of the same breed? can thou deny this to the King too?


With a confidence as great as his.


Faith like enough.


Away, and use him kindly.


Touch not me, I hate the whole strain: if thon follow me a great way off, I Will
give thee up the Fort, and hang your selves


Be gone.


He Is finely wrought.


COme in, What is your name, say you, Abel Drugger?


Yes Sir.


Umh. Free of the Grocers?


I, an't please you.


Well, -- Your business, Abel?


This, an't please your worship; I am a young beginner, and am building of a
new Shop, an't please your Worship, just at corner of a street, (here is the
plat on it) and I would know by Art, Sir, of your Worship, which way I should
make my door, by Necromancie, and where my Shelves, and which should be for
Boxes, and which for Pots. I would be glad to thrive, Sir: and I was wished to
your Worship, by a Gentleman, one Captain Face, that says you know men's
Planets, and their good Angels and their bad


I do, if I do see 'em. --


What! my honest Abel? thou art well met here.


Troth Sir, I was speaking just as your Worship came here, of your Worship: I
pray you speak for me to Master Doctor


He shall do any thing. Doctor, do you hear? this is my friend, Abel, an honest
fellow; he lets me have good Tobacco, and he does not sophisticate it with
Sack-lees, or Oil, nor washes it in Muscadel, and Grains, nor buries it in
Gravel, under ground, wrapped up in greasy leather, or pist clouts, but keeps it
in fine Lilie-pots, that opened, smell like Conserve of Roses, or French Beans.
He has his Maple block, his silver tongs, Winchester pipes, and fire of
Juniper. A neat, spruce-honest fellow, and no Goldsmith


He is a fortunate fellow, that I am sure on.


Already Sir, Ha you found it? Lo thee Abel.


And in right way toward riches. --


Sir?


This Summer, he will be of the clothing of his Company: and next Spring
called to the Scarlet, spend what he can


What, and so little beard!


Sir, you must think he may have a receipt to make hair come: But he will be wise,
preserve his youth, and fine for it: his fortune looks for him another way


'Slid Doctor, how can thou know this so soon? I am amused at that!


By a rule, Captain, in Metaposcopy, which I do work by, a certain Star in the
forehead, which you see not. Your Chest-nut, or your Olive-colour'd face does
never fail; and your long ear does promise. I knew't by certain spots too, in
his teeth, and on the nail of his Mercurial finger


Which finger's that?


This little finger. Look, you were born upon a Wednesday?


Yes indeed, Sir.


The thumb, in Chiromancie, we give Venus, the forefinger to Jove, the midst
to Saturn, the ring to Sol, the least to Mercury, who was the Lord, Sir, of
this Horoscope; his House of Life being Libra, which foreshew'd he should be a
Merchant, and should trade with balance


Why this is strange, is it not, honest Nab?


There is a Ship now coming from Ormus, that shall yield him such a commodity
of Drugs. -- This is the West, and this the South


Yes, Sir.


And those are your two sides?


I, Sir.


Make me your Door then South, your broadside West. And on the East Side of
your Shop, aloft, write Mathlai, Tarmiel, and Baraborat; upon the North part,
Rael, Velel, Thiel: they are the names of those Mercurial Spirits that do
fright Flies from Boxes


Yes, Sir.


And beneath your threshold, bury me a Loadstone to draw in Gallants that wear
Spurs: the rest they will seem to follow


That Is a Secret, Nab!


And on your Stall, a Puppet with a Vice, and a Court-fucus to call
Citie-Dames. You shall deal much with Minerals


Sir, I have, at home, already --


I, I know you have Arsnike, Vitriol, Sal-tartre, Argaile, Alkaly, Cinoper; I
know all. This fellow, Captain, will come, in time, to be a great Distiller,
and give a say, ( I will not say directly, but very fair) at the Philosophers
Stone


Why how now, Abel? is this true?


Good Captain, what must I give him?


Nay, I Will not counsel thee; thou hear'st what wealth (he says, Spend what
thou can) thou art like to come to


I would give him a Crown.


A Crown! and toward such a Fortune! Hear, thou shall rather give him thy Shop.
No gold about thee


Yes, I have a Portague, I have kept this half year.


Out on thee, Nab! 'Slight, there was such an offer -- Shall keep't no longer,
I Will giv't him for thee. Doctor, Nab prays your Worship to drink this, and he
will appear more grateful, as your skill does raise him in this World


I would entreat another favor of his Worship.


What is it, Nab?


But to look over, Sir, my Almanac, and cross out my ill days; that I may
neither bargain, nor trust upon them


That he shall, Nab.


And a direction for his Shelves.


And one thing more, Sir.


What is it, Nab?


A Sign, Sir.


I, a good luckie one, a thriving Sign, Doctor.


I was devising now.


('Slight, Do not say so, he must give you more.) What say you to his
Constellation, Doctor, the Balance


No, that way is stale, and common. A Townsman born in Taurus, gives the Bull,
or the Bulls head; in Aries, the Ram. A poor device: No, I will have his Name
formed in some mystic Character; whose radii striking the senses of the
Passers-by, shall, by a vertual influence, breed affections that may result
upon the party owns it. As thus, --


Nab, have no more gold?


Not here, Sir, I protest.


He first shall have A Bell, that is Abel; and one standing by, whose name is
Dee, in a rugg Gown; there is D and Rugg, that is Drugg; and right anenst him, a
Dog snarling Er, there is Drugger, Abel Drugger; that is his Sign. And here is now
Mystery and Hieroglyphick


Abel, thou art made.


Sir, I do thank his Worship.


Six o'thy legs more will not do it, Nab. He has brought you a pipe of Tobacco,
Doctor


Yes, Sir.


It seems to be good Tobacco; what is it an ounce?


He Will send you a pound or two, Doctor.


O no!


He will do it. It is the goodest soul! Abel, about it; thou shall know more
anon: away, be gone


Keep aloof off, yonder is another Chapman: observe my call.

Where is my drudge? --


Sir.


Take away the Recipient, and rectify the Menstrue from the Phlegma; then pour
it of the Sol, in the Cucurbite, and let 'em macerate together


Yes Sir. And save the ground?


No, Terra damnata must not have entrance in the work. Who are you?


A faithful Brother, if it please you.


What Is that? a Lullianist? a Ripley? filius artis? Can you sublime, and
dulcifie? calcine? Know you the Sapor pontick? Sapor styptick? or what is
homogene, or heterogene


I understand no heathen language, truly.


Heathen, you Knipper-Doling? is ars sacra, or Chrysopoeia, or Spagyrica, or
the Pamphysick, or Panarchick knowledge, a Heathen language


Heathen Greek, I take it.


How! Heathen Greek?


All Is Heathen but the Hebrew.


Sirrah, my Varlet, Stand you forth, and speak to him like a Philosopher:
Answer in the language: Name the Vexations, and the Martyrizations of Metals in
the Work


Sir, Putrefaction, Solution, Ablution, Sublimation, Cohobation, Calcination,
Ceration, and Fixation


This is Heathen Greek to you now? And when comes Vivification?


After Mortification.


What Is Cohobation?


It Is the pouring on your aqua regis, and then drawing him off, to the trine
circle of the seven spears


What Is the proper passion of Metals?


Malleation.


What Is your Ultimum supplicium auri?


Antimonium.


This is Heathen Greek to you? And what is your Mercury?


A very fugitive, he will be gone, Sir.


How know you him?


By his Viscositie, his Oleositie, and his Suscitabilitie.


How do you sublime him?


With the Calce of Egg-shels, white Marble, halk.


Your Magisterium, now, what is that?


Shifting, Sir, your elements, dry into cold, cold into moist, moist into hot,
hot into dry


This is Heathen Greek to you still? Your Lapis Philosophicus?


It Is a Stone, and not a Stone; a spirit, a soul, and body: which if you do
dissolve, it is dissolved; if you coagulate, it is coagulated; if you make it
to fly, it flies


Enough: this is Heathen Greek to you? what are you, Sir?


Please you, a servant of the exile Brethren, that deal with Widows and with
Orphans goods, and make a just account unto the Saints; a Deacon


O you are sent from Mr. Wholesome your Teacher?


From Tribulation Wholesome, our very zealous Pastor.


Good. I have some Orphans goods to come here.


Of what kind, Sir?


Pewter, and Brass, and Irons, and Kitchinware; Metals that we must use ou^
Medicine on: wherein the Brethren may have a penn'orth for ready money


Were the Orphans Parents sincere Professors?


Why do you ask?


Because we then are to deal justly, and give (in truth) their utmost value.


'Slid you would cousen else, and if their Parents were not of the faithful? I
will not trust you, now I think on it, till I have talked with your Pastor. Have
you brought money to buy more Coals


No surely.


No? how so?


The Brethren bid me say unto you, Sir, Surely they, they will not venture any
more till they may see Projection


How?


You Have had for the instruments, as Bricks, and Lome, and Glasses, already,
thirty pound; and for Materials, they say, some ninety more: and they have
heard since, that one at Heidelberg made it of an Egg, and a small paper of
Pin-dust


What Is your name?


My name is Ananias.


Out, the Varlet that cozened the Apostles! Hence, away, fly Mischief. Had
your holy Consistory no name to send me of another sound, then wicked Ananias?
Send your Elders hither to make atonement for you, quickly, and give me
satisfaction, or out goes the fire, and down th'Alembecks, and the Furnace.
Piger Henricus, or what not? Thou wretch, both Senicon and Bufo shall be lost,
tell 'em. All hope of rooting out the Bishops, or th'Antichristian Hierarchy,
shall perish, if they stay threescore minutes. The Aqueitie, Terreitie, and
Sulphureitie, shall run together again, and all be anull'd, thou wicked Ananias

This will fetch 'em, and make 'em haste toward their gulling more.

A man must deal like a rough Nurse, and fright those that are froward, to an
appetite


COme, come, the Sports are coming on us;
Seat, seat your selves, Gentlemen.

Love is little, and therefore I present him:
Love is a fire, therefore you may lament him.

Alas poor Love, who are they that can quench him?


Love shoots, therefore I bear his Bow about:
And Love is blind, therefore my eyes are ou^.

I never heard Love give reason for what he did, before.


Let such as can see, see such as cannot: behold,
Our Goddesses all three strive for the Ball of Gold;
And here fair Paris comes, the hopeful youth of Troy,
Queen Hecubs darling-son, King Priams only joy.

Is this Paris? I should have taken him for Hector rather.


Paris, at this time pray you hold your prating.


Paris can be angry, I see.


At this time he comes as a Judge.


Mercy on all that looks upon him, say I.


The thundering Seas whose watery fires
Washes the Whiting Mops.
The gentle Whale, whose feet so fell,
Flies over the Mountain tops.
No roars so fierce, no throats so deep,
No howls can bring such fears
As Paris can, if Garden from
He calls his Dogs and Bears.

I, those they were that I feared all this while.


Yes, Jack-an-Apes.


I thank you, Sir Paris.


You may hold your peace, and stand farther out
of the way then: the lines will fall where they light.
Yes, Jack-an-Apes, he has to sports,
And faces make like Mirth;
Whilst bellowing Bulls, the horned Beasts
Do toss from Ground to Earth.
Blood Bear there is, as Cupid blind.

That Bear would be whipped for loosing of his eyes.


Be whipped man may see,
But we present no such content, but Nymphs such as they be.

Go Cupid blind, conduct the dumb,
For Ladies must not speak here;
Let Shepherds sing with dancing feet,
And cords of Music break here.
Now Ladies fight, with heels so light,
By lot your luck must fall,
Where Paris please, to do you ease,
And give the golden Ball.

The Dance is ended; now to Judgment, Paris.


Here, Juno, here: but stay, I do espy
A pretty glance coming from Pallas eye:
Here, Pallas, here; yet stay again, methinks
I see the eye of Love, by Venus winks.
Oh close them both! Shut in those golden Eyne,
And I will kiss those sweet blind cheeks of thine.
Juno is angry; yes, and Pallas frowns:
Would Paris now were gone from Ida's Downs.
They both are fair; but Venus has the Mole,
The fairest hair and sweetest dimple hole.
To her, or her, or her, or her, or neither;
Can one man please three Ladies altogether?
No, take it, Venus, toss it at thy pleasure,
Thou art the Lovers friend, beyond his measure.

Paris has done what Man can do, pleased me, who can do more?


Stay, here is another person.


Come, lovely Venus, leave this lower Orb,
And mount with Mars up to his glorious sphere.

How now! what is he?


I Am ignorant what to do, Sir.


Thy silver yoke of Doves are in the Team,
And thou shall fly through Apollo's beam:
I Will see thee seated in thy golden Throne,
And hold with Mars a sweet Conjunction.

Ha! what fellow's this? he has carried away my sister Venus: he never
rehearsed his part with me before


What follows now, Prince Paris?


Hue and cry: I think Sir, this is Venus voice, my own and only sister.


What, is there some Tragick-Act behind?


No, no, altogether Comical; Mars and Venus are in the old Conjunction, it
seems


It Is very improper then; for Venus never cries out when she Conjoyns with Mars.


That Is true indeed, they are out of their parts sure. It may be it is the
Book-holders fault: I Will go see


How like you our Country-Revels, Gentlemen?


Oh, they commend themselves, Sir.


Methinks now Juno and Minerva should take revenge on Paris: it cannot end
without it


It may follow; let us not premeditate the history.


Oh, oh, oh, oh!


So, here is a Passion toward.


Help, help, if you be Gentlemen; my sister, my Venus is stolen away.


The Story changes from our expectation.


Help, my father the Miller will hang me else: God Mars is a bawdy Villain; he
said she should ride upon Doves: she is horsed, she is horsed whether she will or
no


Sure I think he is serious.


She Is horsed upon a double Gelding, and a Stone-horse in the breech of her:
the poor Wench cries help, and I cry help, and none of you will help


Speak, is it the Show, or do thou bawl?


A pox on the Ball; my sister bawls, and I bawl. Either bridle a horse and
follow me, or give me a halter to hang my self: I cannot run so fast as a hog


I Will fill the Country with pursuit, but I will find the Thief. My house thus
abused


It Is my house that is abused, the sister of my flesh and blood: oh, oh, oh!


By all means discharge your follower.


If we can gethim off. Sirrah, thou must needs run back.


But I must not, unless you send a Bier, or a Licter at my back. I do not use
to run from my friends


Well, Go will serve turn: I have forgot.


What, Sir?


See if I can think on it now.


I know what it is now.


A Pistolet of that.


Done; you have forgot a device to send me away. You are going a smocking
perhaps


His own, due, due in faith Antonio: the Pistolet's his own.


I confess it, there it is.

Now if you could afford out of it a reasonable excuse to my Uncle.


Yes, I can: but an excuse will not serve your turn: it must be a lie, a full
lie, a downright lie, 'twill do no good else: if you will go to the price of that


Is a lie dearer then an excuse?


Oh, treble: this is the price of an Excuse; but a Lie is two more. Look how
many foils goes to a fair fall, so many Excuses go to a full Lie; and less
cannot serve your turn, let any Tailor in the Town make it


It Is but reasonable; give him his price: let it be large enough now.


I Will warrant you cover him all over.


I would have proof of one now.


What? scale my Invention beforehand? you shall pardon me for that: Well,
I Will commend you to your Uncle, and tell him you will be at home at Supper with
him


By no means, I cannot come to night (man.)


I know that too; you do not know a lie when you see it: remember it must
stretch for all night


I shall want stuff; I doubt 'twill come to the other Pistolet.


Well, lay out, you shall be no loser, Sir.


It must be faced; you know there will be a yard of Dissimulation at least,
(City-measure) and cut upon an untroth or two, lined with fables, that must
needs be, cold weather coming; if it had a gallon of hypocrisy, 'twould do
well; and hooked together with a couple of Conceits, that is necessity: Well,
I Will bring in my Bill: I Will warrant you as fair a Lie, by that time I have done
with it, as any Gentleman in the Town can swear too, if he would betray his Lord
and Master


So, so, this necessary trouble's over.


I would you had bought an excuse of him before he went: you will want one for
your Lady


Oh Gentlemen, look to your selves, ye are men of another world else; your
enemies are upon you: the old house of the Bellides will fall upon your heads:
Seignior Lisauro


Lisauro?


And Don what call you him? he is a Gentleman: yet he has but a yeomans name,
Don Tarse, Tarso, and a dozen at their heels


Lisauro, Tarso, nor a dozen more, shall fright me from my ground, nor shun my
path, let 'em come on in their ablest fury


It Is worthily resolved: I Will stand by you, Sir; this way I am thy true friend.


I Will be gone, Sir, that one may live to tell what is become of you. -- Put up,
put up; will you never learn to know a Lie from an Aesops Fable? there is a
taste for you now


It Is very well, adieu Trojan.


My mind's unquiet; while Antonio
My Nephew is abroad, my heart is not at home,
Only my fears stay with me; bad Company;
But I cannot shift 'em off. This hatred
Betwixt the house o'th Bellides and Us,
Is not fair War: it is civil, but uncivil.
It has lasted too many Sun-sets.
Man should not lose so many days of Peace,
To satisfy the Anger of one minute.
I could repent it heartily. I sent
The Knave to attend my Antonio too,
Yet he returns no comfort to me neither.

No, I must not.


Hah! he is come.


I must not; '^will break his heart to hear it.


How! he will not tell me for breaking of my heart: it is half split already, I
must obscure and hear it


I have spied him: Now to knock down a Don with a Lie, a silly harmless Lie;
'twill be valiantly done, and nobly perhaps


I cannot hear him now.


Oh the bloody days that we live in! the envious, malicious, deadly days that
we draw breath in


Now I hear too loud.


The children that ever shall be born, may rue it; for men that are slain now,
might have lived to have got children, that might have cursed their fathers


Oh my posterity is ruined!


Oh sweet Antonio!


Oh dear Antonio!


Yet it was nobly done on both parts, when he and Lisauro met.


Oh, Death has parted'em.


VVelcome my mortal Foe (says one,) welcome my deadly Enemy (says the
other): off go their doublets, they in their shirts, and their swords, stark
naked; here lies Antonio, here lies Lisauro: he comes upon him with an
Embroccado, that he puts by with a puncta reversa: Lisauro recoils me two paces
and some six inches back, takes his Career, and then, oh


Oh!


Runs Antonio quite through.


Oh Villain!


Quite through, between the arm and the body; so he had no hurt at that bout.


Goodness be praised.


But then at th'next Encounter, he fetches me up Lisauro* Lisauro makes out a
Long at him, which he thinking to be a Passada, Antonio's foot sliping: down,
oh, down


Oh now thou art lost.


Oh but the quality of the thing: both Gentlemen, both Spanish Christians, yet
one man to shed --


Say his Enemies blood.


His hair may come by diverse Casualties, though he never go into the Field with
his Foe: but a man to lose nine ounces and two drams of blood at one wound,
thirteen and a scruple at another, and to live till he die in cold blood: yet
the Surgeon (that cured him) said, if Pia-mater had not been perished, he
had been a lives man to this day


There he concludes he is gone.


But all this is nothing: now I come to the point.


I, the point, that is deadly: the ancient blow over the buckler never went half
so deep


Yet Pity bids me keep in my Charity: for me to pull an old Man's ears from his
head with telling of a Tale: Oh foul Tale! Furthermore, there is the charge of
Burial; every one will cry blacks, blacks, that had but the least finger in his
blood, though ten degrees removed when 'twas done. Moreover, the Surgeon
(that made an end of him) will be paid: Sugar-plums, and Sweet-breads; yet it
may be the Man may recover again, and die in his bed


What motley stuff is this? Sirrah, speak truth what has befallen my dear
Antonio; what thou keep'it back from truth, thou shall speak in pain: do not
look to find a Limb in his right place, a Bone unbroke, nor so much flesh
unbroil'd of all that Mountain, as a Worm might sup on; dispatch, or be
dispatched


Alas Sir, I know nothing, but that Antonio is a man of Gods making to this
hour; it is not two since I left him so


When did thou leave him?


In the same clothes he had on when he went from you.


Does he live?


I saw him drink.


Is he wounded?


He may have a cut in the leg by this time: for Don Martin and he were at whole
slashes


Met he not with Lysauro?


I do not know her.


Her? Lysauro is a man as he is.


I saw never a man like him.


Did not thou discourse a fight betwixt Antonio and Lysauro?


I, to my self: I hope a man may give himself the Lie, if it please him?


Did thou lie then?


As sure as you live now.


I live the happier by it: when will he return?


That he sent me to tell you, within these ten days, at farthest.


Ten days? he was not wont to be absent two.


Nor I think he will not.

He said he would be at home to morrow; but I love to speak within my compass.


You shall speak within mine, Sir, now. Within there: take this fellow into
custody

keep him safe, I charge you.


Safe! do you hear? take notice what plight you find me in: if there want but
a Collop, or a Steak of me, look to it


If my Nephew return not in his health to morrow, thou go to the Rack.


Let me go to th'Manger first;
I had rather eat Oats then Hay.

So-hoh, Miller, Miller,

Look out, Miller: Is there never a Miller amongst you here, Gentlemen?


Yes, here is a Miller amongst Gentlemen, a Gentleman-Miller.


I should not be far off then; there went but a pair of Shears and a Bodkin
between us. Will you to work, Miller? here is a Maid has a Sack full of News for
you: Shall your Stones walk? will you grind, Miller


This your son, Franio?


My ungratious, my disobedient, my unnatural, my Rebel-son, (my Lord.)


Fie, your hopper runs over, Miller.


This Villain (of my own flesh and blood) was accessory to the stealing of my
daughter


Oh Mountain!

Shall thou call a Molehill a scab upon the face of the earth? though a Man be
a Thief, shall a Miller call him so? Oh egregious


Remember, sirrah, who you speak before.


I speak before a Miller, a Thief in grain; for he steals Corn. He that steals
a Wench, is a true Man, to him


Can you prove that?


I Will prove it strongly.

He that steals Corn, steals the Bread of the Commonwealth: he that steals a
Wench, steals but the flesh


And how is their Bread-stealing more criminal then the flesh?


He that steals bread, steals that which is lawful every day: he that steals
flesh, steals nothing from the fasting day: Ergo, to steal the bread is the
arranter Thief


This is to some purpose.


Again, he that steals flesh, steals for his own belly full: he that steals
bread, robs the Guts of others: Ergo, the arranter Thief the Bread-stealer.
Again, he that steals flesh, steals once and gives over; yes, and often pays
for it; the other steals every day without satisfaction. To conclude,
Bread-stealing is the more Capital Crime: for what he steals, he puts it in at
the head; he that steals flesh (as the Dutch Author says) puts it in at the
foot (the lower Member.) Will you go as you are now, Miller


I can no longer own
What is not mine with a free Conscience.
My Liege, your pardon.

For what? who knows this woman?


I, best (my Lord.)

I have been acquainted with her these forty Summers, and as many Winters, were
it Spring again; she is like the Gout, I --


Oh, your wife.


It Is oh my wife indeed (my Lord) a painful stitch to my side; would it were
picked out


Well, Sir, your silence.


Will you be older and older every day then other? the longer you live, the
older still? Must his Majesty command your silence, ere you will hold your
tongue


Your reprehension runs into the same fault: Pray Sir, will you be silent.


I have told him this before now (my Liege) but Age will have his course, and
his weaknesses


Good Sir, your forbearance.


And his frailties, and his follies (as I may say) that cannot hold his tongue
ere he be bidden


Why sirrah, ha?


But I believe your Majesty will not be long troubled with him: I hope that
woman has something to confess, will hang 'em both


Sirrah, you will pull your Destiny upon you, If you cease not the sooner.


Nay, I have done; yet it grieves me that I should call that man father, that
should be so shameless, that being commanded to hold his tongue --


To th'Porters Lodge with him.


I thank your Grace, I have a friend there.


It hardly will get passage, it is a sorrow of that greatness grown, 'less it
dissolve in tears, and come by parcels


I Will help you, Sir, in the delivery, and bring you forth a joy: you lost a
daughter


'Twas that recounted thought brought forth these sorrows.


She Is found again; Know you this Mantle, Sir?


Hah!


This did enwrap your child, now the Counts wife, etc.


Oh thou have ta'n so many years from me, and made me young as was her
birthday to me


You knew this before.


Oh, oh; Item for you Miller.


I did, my Liege, I must confess I did; We poor ones love, and would have
comfort, Sir, as well as great


I beseech you, (my Liege) let this Woman be a little farther examined; let the
words of her Conscience be searched. I would know how she came by me; I am a
lost child, if I be theirs: though I have been brought up in a Mill, yet I had
ever a mind (methought) to be a greater man


Thou art mine own flesh and blood, born of mine own body.


It Is very unlikely that such a body should bear me; there is no trust in these
Millers. Woman, tell the truth, my father shall forgive thee, whatsoever he
was; were he Knight, Esquire, or Captain; less he could not be


Thou art mine own child, Boy.


And was the Miller my father?


Would thou make thy mother a whore, Knave?


I, if she make me a Bastard. The Rack must make her confess, I shall never
come to know who I am else. I have a worshipful mind in me sure: methinks I do
scorn poor folks


You both shall be rewarded bountifully. We'll be a kin too, Brother and Sister
shall be changed with us ever


Thank you (Uncle) my Sister is my Cousin yet at the last cast: farewell
Sister-foster. If I had known the Civil Law would have allowed it, thou had
had another manner of husband then thou have: but much good do thee; I Will dance
at thy Wedding, kiss the Bride, and so


Why how now, Sirrah?


It Is lawful now, she is none of my sister.

It was a Miller and a Lord
That had a Scabbard and a Sword,
He put it up in the Country word,
The Miller and his Daughter.
She has a face, and she can sing,
She has a grace, and she can spring;
She has a place, with another thing,
Tradoodle.
I would I were acquainted with your Tailor (noble Brother.)


You may, there he is.


If you have any work for me, I can fit you. Sir, I fitted the Lady.


My sister (Tailor)? What fits her, will hardly fit me: you have a true Yard
(Tailor)


Never a whit too long, I warrant you.


Then (Tailor) march with me away;
I scorn these Robes, I must be gay,
My Noble Brother he shall pay
Tom Tailor.

A Pleurisy, I see it.


I rather hold for tremor cordis.


Do you mark the Foeces?


It Is a most pestilent contagious Fever, a Surfeit, a plaguey Surfeit: he must
bleed


By no means.


I say, bleed.


I say it is dangerous, the person being spent so much beforehand, and nature
drawn so low: Clysters, cool Clysters


Now, with your favor, I should think a Vomit; for take away the Cause, the
Effect must follow: the stomack's foul and fur'd, the pot's inflamed yet


Will it please you draw near? the sick Gentleman grows worse and worse still.


We will attend him.


He shall do well, my friend.


My Masters love, Sir.


There Is no doubt in him, none at all, never fear him.


Clap on the Cataplasm.


Good Gentlemen, good learned Gentlemen.


And see those broths there ready within this hour: pray keep your arms in; the
air is raw, and ministers much evil


Pray leave me, I beseech you leave me, Gentlemen, I have no other sickness but
your presence; convey your Cataplasms to those that need 'em, your Vomits and
your Clysters


Pray be ruled, Sir.


Bring in the Lettice Cap; you must be shaved, Sir, and then how suddenly we'll
make you sleep


Till Doomsday: What unnecessary nothings are these about a wounded mind?


How do ye?


What questions they propound too! How do you, Sir? I am glad to see you well.


A great distemper, it grows hotter still.


Open your mouth, I pray, Sir.


Can you tell me how old I am then? there is my hand, pray show me how many
broken shins within this two year. Who would be thus in fetters? Good Master
Doctor, and you dear Doctor, and the third sweet Doctor, and as precious Master
Apothecary, I do pray you to give me leave to live a little longer: ye stand
before me like my blacks


How do thou Frank? bear up, boy; what, shrink in the sinews for a little
sickness


Thou art a mad Companion, never staid, Tom?


Let Rogues be staid, that have no habitation, a Gentleman may wander: sit thee
down, Frank, and see what I have brought thee: Come, discover, open the Scene,
and let the work appear: a friend at need, you Rogue, is worth a Million


What have thou there, a Julip?


He must not touch it, it is present death.


Ye are an *Ass, a Twir-pipe, a Jeffery-John-bopeep: thou minister? thou mend a
left handed pack-saddle; out Puppy. My friend Frank, but a very foolish fellow:
do thou see that bottle? view it well


I do, Tom.


There be as many lives in it as a Cat carries, it is everlasting liquor.


What?


Old Sack, boy, old reverend Sack.


I see no harm, Tom, drink with moderation.


Drink't with Sugar, which I have ready here; and here is a glass, boy, fill it:
hang up your Julips, and your Portugal-possets, your Barley-broths, and Sorrel
sops; they are mangy, and breed the Scratches only: give me Sack: have at thee


Do: I Will pledge thee.


Take it off thrice, and then cry, Heigh! like a Huntsman, with a clear heart,
and no more fits I Will warrant thee; the only Cordial, Frank


Are the things ready?


Long since, Sir.


Bring out the oils then.


Now or never, Gentlemen, do me a kindness, and deliver me.


From whom, boy?


From those things that talk there, Physicians, Tom, Physicians,
Scouring-sticks; they mean to read upon me


And be thou confident we will deliver thee: for look ye, Doctors, say the
Devil were sick now, his horns sawed off, and his head bound with a biggin,
sick of a Calenture, taken by a surfeit of stinking souls, at his Nephews and S.
Dunstans, what would you minister upon the sudden? your Judgment, short and
sound


A fools head.


No Sir, it must be a Physicians, for three causes; the first, because it is a
bald-head likely, which will down easily without apple-pap


A main cause.


So it is, and well considered. The second, for it is filled with broken Greek,
Sir, which so tumbles in his stomach, Doctor, and works upon the Crudities,
conceive me, the fears and the fiddle-strings within it, that those damned
souls must disembogue again


Or meeting with the Stygian humor.


Right, Sir.


Forced with a Cataplasm of Crackers.


Ever.


Scowre all before him like a Sca^inger.


Satisfecisti Domine. My last cause, my last is, and not least, most learned
Doctors, because in most Physicians heads (I mean those that are most
excellent, and old withal, and angry, though a Patient say his prayers, and
Paracelsians that do trade with poisons, we have it by tradition of great
VVriters) there is a kind of Toadstone bred, whose virtue the Doctor, being
dried


We are abused, Sirs.


I take it so, or shall be: for say, the Belly-ach caused by an inundation of
Pease-porridge, are we therefore to open the Port-vein, or the Port-Esquiline


A learned question: or grant the Diaphragma by a rupture, the Sign being then
in the head of Capricorn --


Meet with the passion Hypercondriaca, and so cause a Carnositie in the
Kidneys, must not the brains being buttered with this humor? answer me that


Most excellently argued.


The next fit you will have, my most fine Scholar, Bedlam shall find a salve
for. Fare you well, Sir: we came to do you good, but these young Doctors, it
seems, have boar'd our Noses


Drink hard, Gentlemen, and get unwholsom Drabs; it is ten to one then we shall
hear farther from ye, your Note altered


And will thou be gone, says one.


And will thou be gone, says the other.


Then take, take the odd Crown,
To mend thy old Gown,

And we'll be gone all together.


My learned Tom, gramercy.


Who for your Pleasure has produced his Store;
And as you like, he will furnish you with more.
