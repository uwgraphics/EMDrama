WHen the proud Towers of Concords Temple rise,
Her Basis stands on Earth, and Head in the Skies;
Heavens darling Blessing, and the Worlds fair Soul;
Concord, the mighty Axis turns the Pole.
Till her fair Head above the Waters bore
'Twas Chaos and Confusion all before.
Concord, by whom Truth raigns, and Empires stand,
States flourish, all by her supporting Hand.
As such the Shrine, and such the Deity,
What must the Founder of her Temple be?
That, Sr's, Your Work: Our Concords Walls You build,
Whilst Our Praetorian Chair thus nobly filled,
Such Massy Worth and Morals so refined,
Such leading Virtue with true Honor joined,
Shall stand those fair Examples for mankind;
Till Our blessed Gates with Love and Union filled,
Fair Concords Brightest Wreath Your Brow shall guild.
Nor the Happy London's only shall You bless,
But Your own Merchant-Taylors Walls no less,
With such United Worth enricht and stored,
'Twixt such a Master there, here such a Lord.
UPon a very Large Stage is fixed a Noble Triumphant Chariot, (drawn by two
Golden Camels) richly and curiosly adorned, with all the Glorious Ornaments of
Carved Work as Art can perform, in its gldiing and painting, and all
Illustration enricht with several Delightful Figures, as well Artificial as
Natural lively represented, and properly appertaining to the Solemnity of the
Day. On the most Noble and Greatest Seat of this Structure sits Minerva, the
Goddess in Chief of all the Arts and Sciences, a person of a Majestic Aspect,
attired with long thick bright curld Hair, on her Head a Silver Head-peice,
graced with a high flourishing Plume of Feathers consisting of diverse Falls;
she is attired in Rich Robe of Gold surfled with Silver, and over all a Noble
Scarf of Carnation silk fringed with Gold, with a Crimson Mantle laid with
Ermyn. In one Hand she bears a Bannor of the Companies Arms, in the other a
Shield of the Cities Arms. On a Descent beneath her are placed three Graces,
viz. Vigilance, Diligence, and Labor, being expressed by the Kettle Drums and
Trumpets. In the Front of these, remote from the former, sits a Figure
personating Time, who holds the Reins of these two stately Camels excellently
carved and gilded, and painted in equal proportion to the Life, with Trappings
of Crimson and Silver, and Crimson Bridles, as being the supporters of the
Honorable Company of Merchant-Taylors Arms. This Figure of Time is so ordered
to hold the Reins of this Triumphant Chariot, as intimating the Antiquity of
this Honorable Company, the Records of their Magnificence and Glory, having
lasted so many long Ages past, and whose Chariot shall still drive on till Time
it self shall finish. On the Backs of the two Camels are seated, or mounted two
sweat young Yrinces, a Negro and a Pawny, the one an Asian, and the other an
African, in their Richest Robes, attired in the most Princely Dress of those
Countries, with Coronets on their Heads beset with plumes of variety of diverse
colored Feathers. In their Right Hands they bear two displaid Banners, one the
Cities, the other the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor intimating their Fealty
and Submission to the Heroic Monarch of Great Britain, the sole Sovereign of
the Sea, and so far Lord of the World from Our British Communion and Traffic
in the Richest Asian and African Commerce, etc. And likewise implying their
Ambition to hold an amicable Correspondence with this Renowned City. Moreover,
upon this Stage are placed three Figures representing the Seasons of the Day,
viz. Morning, Noon, and Evening; attired in their proper Habits, with gilded
Banners suitable to 'em all, intimating that Vigilence, Diligence and Labor
are the Duties of every Hour of Life: and at each Corner is four Golden Cypress
Trees. His Lorship is saluted by Minerva in this Speech, etc

SIr, in Your bright Inauguration Glory,
Amongst the humble Knees that bend before You,
With the just Tribute of her earlyest Vows
Thus low the dutiful Minerva bows:
Arts and Wits Sacred Goddess, with her fair
Triumphant Chariot, waits Your nobler Chair.
Yes Sir, whilst London Europes proudest Town,
And Albion's fairest Head, Your power must own;
Her Wheel, her Loom, her Industry, are all
But Menials, Sir, to Your commanding Call:
Her Arts encouraging Lord is only You;
Nor is Wits Patron less Your Title too:
Both Atributes so well You have deserved;
Wit, I am sure, never kinder Master served.
Then Sir beneath the influence of Your Reign,
I, and my Muses, all Your Duteous Train,
Shall sing Your praises in that cheerful Chorus,
From this blessed Day smile the whole Year before us.
AS a farther Testimony of their Zeal and Esteem for his Lordship, they present
my Lord with a Ship, named the William and Mary, a Merchant Adventurer. This
Ship is laden with Cloth, Silk and Stuffs of all sorts, as representing the
Traffic in which His Lordship deals into Foraign Countries. This stately
Vessel bears all her Guns, with Ancients and Pendants, Streamers, Flaggs
Standarts, Tackling, Braces, Bowls, Cables, Anchors, Sayls and Cordages, and
all sort of Rigging appertaining to a Merchant-Man of that Burden, being richly
gilded and painted with all her Waste Clothes

On board this Ship are a Captain and his Mate, a Bosewain and Mariner, each
man at work, some at the main Tack, others at the main Braces, others the
Bowlings, some climbing up to the Maintop, others siting cross the Yard-Arms.
Others with Quarter Canns drinking the King and Queens Health; the Lord Mayors,
and the Honorable Companies, with Guns fireing, Shouts, Huzahs and
Acclamations, as the Expressions of their Joy for his Lordship's Inauguration,
and their Dutiful salutes to welcome him to the Chair, with Songs and Trumpets
sounding, proper to the Action and the Honor of the Merchant-Taylors

The Captain with his Crew placing themselves on the Quarter Deck, dressed in
Indian silks, with rich Fur Caps, attired like Seafaring men; the Bosewain
having given his signal by a whistle, and commanded silence, the Sirens being
placed in the Sea leave off their melodious Music, and display their Bannors
whilst the Captain accosts his Lordship

STrike Saylor, strike, Your Homaging Topsayls lower,
And humbly veil to yond commanding Power,
That awful Power that fills our swelling Sail,
And whose kind Smile lends all our prosperous Gale.
Our duteous Tribute, Sir, is all Your Due;
Our Canvass Wings are only plumed for You:
For You alone our Tritons Trumpets sound;
And our pleased Nereids Dance their watery round.
And if, when Your Great Name of Honor calls,
The rattling Music from our wooden Walls
Does with her loudest Mouths of Thunder roar,
It Is to salute the Lord that rules our Shore.
But what, alas, in the Triumphs of this Day
Can my poor Flags and humble Pinnace Pay,
To You that guide a prouder Helm than Mine;
Glory that does with brighter Streamers shine?
And since our fair Metropolis's Command
Is lodged in such an Honorable Hand,
The safe Augusta shall no Shipwreck fear,
Whilst so much Virtue her great Bark shall stear.
WIthin this large Plain are Eleven or Twelve Figures, all clothed in their
proper Habits, as Nymphs and Shepherds of Arcadia, with gilded Streamers and
Bannors, being the Ensigns of Honor, of the Worthy Members of the Honorable
Company. Amongst these is Industry a Spinning, and several of the
Shepherdesses,; some Carding and some Cutting of Wool, and all Singing and
Dancing, when the Matron or Mistress of the Family calls from Work, they having
all their Scrips and Wallets, Bottles of Leather, and Baskets with Shepherds
Crooks and Straw Hats and Garlands of Flowers round their Heads, the Pageant
being all ornamented suitable to so rural a place, and enlivened with variety
of Pastoral Music accordingly. In the Front of this pleasant Plain is planted
a gilded Lion, the Plain all strewed with Greens and Flowers, and other
Ornaments befitting the place, and also proper for so Noble an Augmentation
that was given from one of the Kings of England, out of his own Imperial Arms,
in Honor of the Worshipful Company of Merchant-Taylors, for some very
Illustrious Acts of Chivalry performed by the Famous and Noble Sir John
Hawkwood, once a Member of this Royal Society, whereof has been Eleven Kings,
Twenty two Princes and Dukes, Twenty seven Bishops, Forty seven Earls, Seventy
seven Lords and Barons; besides Ninteen Lord Mayors to this present Year, who
all received the Honor of Knighthood

In the Rear of this Pageant is seated on a Throne, a Soldier under a Royal
Canopy, as the Arms of the Honorable Company attended on each hand by two
Persons in Parliamentary Robes, who addresses his Speech to his Lordship,
himself representing that Famous and Memorable Hawkwood

BEhold, before me on these Verdant Plains
'The Crooks, the Fleece, the Wheel, the Nymphs and Swains,
All Homagers to the Merchant-Taylors Name;
Their Rural Reeds the Trumps of Your fair Fame:
And whilst these Sons of Peace in the Front appear
Your Hawkwood, Son of War, brings up the Rear.
Hawkwood who, that bold Martial Champion stood,
Whose once Illustrious Feats in Fields of Blood,
In Your Rich Scutcheon fixed that fair Renown,
A borrowed Lion from the British Crown.
But why do we revive old Hawkwood's Name,
When we have a Younger Nobler Heir of Fame;
Your Lorship whose Renown outvies his poorer Story,
Who dare as much for Truth, as Hawkwood durst for Glory.
TO sing the Renown of the brave Merchant-Taylors
Come blow a fresh Gale, Boys, and Hey jolly Saylors.
For weell merrily troll
All around round the Pole;
Weell cut the Sea through;
And bring home the Wealth of the Indian Peru.
For the World has no Lord but the Merchant alone;
And the whole Phoenix Nest, Boys, is all but Your own.
Then in the Triumphs of the Day,
To the Merchants weell pay
Our heartiest Zeal and Devotion:
Weell sing, and weell laugh,
And the Bowls that we quaff
Shall hold a whole Iittle little Ocean.
Weell cut through the Line, Boys; then hey merry Saylors;
From Cancer to Capricorn bold Merchant-Taylors:
It Is for You the North Swain
Drives the Great Charles his Wain:
The Star at the Pole
For You lends the Needle her whole Life and Soul;
Whilst the Sun in the Skies, and the Stars in their Glory
Are all but Your Linkboys to travel before You.
Then, etc.
To the jolly God Cupid do Mortals build Altars;
And sing Loves soft Chorus in sweet Virgin Psalters?
Does the Beauty Divine
In its whole Glory shine?
Though bright as the Morn
It Is the Merchants rich Wardrobes proud Venus adone.
Her downy foft Sweets all but his rich Perfumes;
And our Mistresses shrine but in his borrowed Plumes.
Then, etc.
In City and Country, both Profit and Pleasu^^
Come all from the Hoard of the Merchants rich Treasure.
Even the poor Country Cloun,
When he comes up to Town,
No sooner he goes
To buy a new Topknot for Peggy and Rose,
But merrily home again home he trips down,
And thanks the kind Merchant for Jo^ns Wedding Gown.
Then, etc.
Do we drink a brisk Health to Great William and Mary
In blushing fair Claret, or smiling Canary?
When the Conduits run Wine,
What Is the Nectar Divine
That cheers up our Souls,
But the Merchants rich Juice, Boys, that Sparks in our Bowls?
And the proud Golden Goblet we drink in's no more
Than a Relick a Relick from the Merchants fair Store.
(...) etc.
The Pageantry concluding, the Lord Mayor and the whole Train move off to
Dinner, which finishes the Solemnity of the Day.
