MORTIMER HIS FALL.

A TRAGEDY, WRITTEN BY BEN. JOHNSON.

Et docuit magnumque loqui, nitique cothurno.

Printed M.DC.XL.

THe first Act comprehends Mortimers pride and security, raised to the degree
of an Earl, by the Queens favor, and love; with the Counsels of Adam
D'orlton, the politic B. of Worc'ter, against Lancaster

The Chorus of Ladies, celebrating the worthiness of the Queen; in rewarding
Mortimers services, and the Bishops

The second Act shows the Kings love, and respect to his Mother, that will
hear nothing against Mortimers greatness, or believe any report of her
extraordinary favors to him, but imputes all to his Cousin Lancasters envy;
and commands there-after, an utter silence of those matters

The Chorus of Courtiers, celebrating the Kings worthiness of Nature, and
Affection to his Mother, who will hear nothing, that may trench upon her
honor, though delivered by his Kinsman, of such neerenesse, and thereby take
occasion to extol the Kings piety, and their own happiness under such a
King

The third Act relates (by the occasion of a vision, the blind Earl of L. had)
to the Kings Brother E. of Cornwall, the horror of their Fathers death, and
the cunning making away of their Uncle, the Earl of K. by Mortimers hired
practice

The Chorus of Country Justices, and their Wives, telling how they were
deluded, and made believe, the old King lived, by the show of him in Corfe
Castle; and how they saw him eat, and use his knife, like the old King, etc.
with the description of the feigned Lights, and Masks there, that deceived
'hem, all which came from the Court

The fourth Act expresses by conference between the K. and his Brother a
change, and intention to explore the truth of those reports, and a charge of
employing W. Montacute, to get the keys of the Castle of Not. into the K.
power, and draw the Constable, Sir Rob. D'Eland, to their party

Mortimers security, scorn of the Nobility, too much familiarity with the
Queen, related by the Chorus, the report of the Kings surprising him in his
Mothers bedchamber, a general gladness, his being sent to execution

The fifth Act, the Earl of Lancasters following the cry, and meeting the
report. The Celebration of the Kings Justice

THis Rise is made, yet! and we now stand, ranck'd,
To view about us, all that were above us!
Naught hinders now our prospect, all are even,
We walk upon a Level. Mortimer
Is a great Lord of late, and a new thing! --
At what a diverse price, do diverse men
Act the same things! Another might have had
Perhaps the Hurdle, or at least the Axe,
For what I have this Crownet, Robes, and Wax.
There is a Fate, that flies with towering spirits
Home to the mark, and never checks at conscience.
Poor plodding Priests, and preaching Friars may make
Their hollow Pulpits, and the empty Isles
Of Churches ring with that round word: But we
That draw the subtle, and more piercing air,
In that sublimed region of Court,
Know all is good, we make so, and go on
Secured by the prosperity of our crimes.
To day, is Mortimer made Earl of March.
For what? For that, the very thinking it
Would make a Citizen start! some politic Tradesman
Curle with the Caution of a Constable!
But I, who am no common Council man,
Knew, injuries of that dark nature done
Were to be thoroughly done, and not be left
To fear of a revenge. They'are light offenses
Which admit that. The great ones get above it.
Man does not nurse a deadlier piece of folly
To his high temper, and brave soul, then that
Of fancying goodness, and a seal to live by
So differing from man's life. As if with Lions,
Bears, Tigers, Wolves, and all those beasts of Prey,
He would affect to be a Sheep! Can man
Neglect what is, so, to attain what should be,
As rather he will call on his own ruin,
Then work to assure his safety? I should think
When amongst a world of bad, none can be good,
(I mean so absolutely good, and perfect,
As our religious Confessors would have us)
It is enough, we do decline the rumor
Of doing monstrous things: And, yet, if those
Were of emolument, unto our ends,
Even of those, the wiseman will make friends
For all the brand, and safely do the ill,
As Usurers rob, or our Physicians kill.

My Lord! sweet Mortimer!

My Q. my Mistress!
My Sovereign! nay, my Goddess! and my Juno!
What name, or title, as a mark of Power
Upon me, should I give you?

Isabel,
Your Isabel, and you my Mortimer:
Which are the marks of Paritie, not power
And these are titles, best become our love.

Can you fall under those?

Yes, and be happy.
Walk forth, my loved, and gentle Mortimer,
And let my longing eyes enjoy their feast,
And fill of thee; my faire-shap'd, God-like man:
Thou art a banquet unto all my Senses;
Thy form does feast mine eye, thy voice mine ear,
Thy breath, my smell, thy every kiss my taste;
And softness of thy skin, my very touch:
As if I felt it dactile through my blood.
I never was reconciled to these robes,
This garb of England, till I saw thee in them.
Thou make, they seem not boistrous, nor rude,
Like my rough haughty Lords de Engle-terre,
With whom I have so many years been troubled.

But now redeemed, and set at liberty,
Queen of your self, and them.
