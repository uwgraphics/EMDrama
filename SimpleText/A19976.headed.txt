HOw now gallants, what is it? what is it?


The I Will of Gulls.


The I Will of Gulls, what should that be?


A play by the name, but come shals quarter our selves?


If some had had the wit to do so in time, they might ha saude the hangman a
labor. But come boy, furnish us with stools


Pardon me sir, my office is to speak a Prologue, not to provide you stools.


And you were the Epilogue to sir-


Fie be not inciuill: do hear youth, prithee what is he that discouerd your new
found Land, the I Will of Gulls? what is he


A mere stranger sir.


A stranger? the better welcome: comes he Eastward, Westward, or Northward
hoe


None of the three ways I assure you.


Prithee where is he?


Not on his knees in a corner, to Apollo praying that his play may hold in a
good hand at Passadge, not on the stage amongst gallants, preparing a bespoke
Plaudite; but close in his study writing hard, to get him a handsome suite
against Summer


And where sits his friends? has he not a prepared company of gallants, to
aplaud his jests, and grace out his play


None I protest: Do Poets use to bespeake their Auditory.


The best in grace do, and but for that, some that I know, had never had their
grace in Poetry till this day


Then must our Author look for a certain disgrace, for he is altogether
unfurnished of such a friendly audience


Then he must lay his trial upon God and good wits. But why does he call his
play The I Will of Gulls, it begets much expectation


Not out of any dogged disposition, not that it figures a(...) certain state,
or private government: far be that supposition (...) the thought of any
indifferent Auditor: and the argument being a little string or Riuolet, drawn
from the full streine of the right worthy Gentleman, Sir Phillip Sydneys well
known Archadea, confirms it: only a Duke to make trial of certain
experiments, retyres with his retinue into a Namelesse desert. Now as well for
fashion sake, as that all those which have to do in that desert, are guld in
the reach of their hopes, therefore he calls it, (and as he presumes, not
improperlie) The I Will of Gulls


Out a question he has promised thee some fee, thou pleadest so hard for him,
but and he be a right Poet he will never perform it. But what method observes
he in his play, is it any thing Critical? Are Lawyers fees, and Citizens wives
laid open in it: I love to hear vice anotomizd, and abuse let blood in the
master vain, is there any great man's life charactred int


None I protest sir, only in the person of Dametas he expresses to the life the
monstrous and deformed shape of vice, as well to beget a lothing of abuse, as
that his villainy may give the greater luster to the virtuous dispositions of
true-borne gentilitie


All that's nothing to me, and there be not Wormwood water and Copperes int,
I Will not like it, should Apollo write it, and Rosius himself act it


Fie upon thee, thou art too too Critical: is there any good baudry int, jests
of an ell deep, and a fathom broad, good cuckolding, may a couple of
young-setters up learn to do well int? Give me a scene of venery, that will
make a men's spirrits stand on their typtoes, and die his blood in a deep
scarlet, like your Ouids Ars Amandi, there flows the true Springhead of
Poetry, and the very Crystal fount of Parnassus


Chaste ears would never endure it sir.


Chaste ears, now deafenes light upon em, what should chaste ears do at a
play


It Is strange now, I am of neither a both your opinions, I like neither railing
nor baudry: no, give me a stately pend history, as thus, The rugged winds,
with rude and ragged ruffes. etc


Fie vpont, mere Fustian; I had rather hear two good baudie jests, then a
whole play of such teare-cat thunderclaps


Alas Gentlemen, how is it possible to content you? you will (...) railing, and
inuectiues, which our Author neither dares, nor affects: you baudy and
scurrill jests, which neither becomes his modesty to write, nor the ear of a
generous Auditory to hear: you must ha swelling comparisons, an^ bumbast
Epithites, which are as fit for the body of a C^^^edie, as Hercules shoe for
the foot of a Pygmey: yet all these we must have, and all in one play; or it is
already condemnd to the hell of eternal disgrace


Look toot, if there be not gall int, it shall not pass.


If it be not baudie, it is impossible to pass.


If it be both Critical and baudy, if it be not high written, both your Poet
and the house to, loose a friend of me


Nay I beseech you sir, if you be his friend, stand so to him still, for he
has too many enemies already, in whose judgments, he and his labors stand
excommunicate, as though unworthy to present themselves in this assembly


Enemies, nays foot then there is some hope in's play, for Envy never works
but against desert and merit. If he be envied there is some worth in him, and
I Will see out his play for that only


Faith and I Will see an act or two out, but I tell you aforehand I cannot see it
out


Not see it out? your reason.


Fore God I lay in bed till past three a clock, slept out my dinner, and my
stomach will toule to supper before five, therefore you must pardon me


Either see it all or none; for it is grown into a custom at plays, if any one
rise (especially of any fashionable sort) about what serious business soever,
the rest thinking it in dislike of the play, tho he never thinks it, cry mew,
by Jesus vilde; and leave the poor hartlesse children to speak their Epilogue
to the empty seats


Why do think thy audience like a flock of sheep, that one cannot leap
over a hedge, but all the rest will follow, they ha more of reason in them then
so


Well, I Will sit out the play, and be but to avoid that sheepish imputation, but
see it be baudy, or by this light I and all my friends will hiss


You should not deal gentleman-like with us else.


The misery that waits upon the pen
Of the best Writers, judge it gentlemen,
Let them express the very soul of wit,
And want Opinions voice to countnance it,
It Is like the idle buzzing of a fly,
Heard, not regarded: wretched Poetry:
If a write mirth, it is Rybaldry, and mean,
Scornd of chaste ears. If he compose a Scene
Of high writ Poesy, fitting a true stage,
It Is counted fustian: If portick rage
Strike at abuse, or open the vain of sin,
He is straight informed against for libelling.
Neither quick mirth, inuectiue, nor high state,
Can content all: such is the boundless hate
Of a confused Audience: Then we
That scarcely know the rules of Poesy
Cannot escape check. Yet this our comfort is,
The wise will smile to hear the impartial hiss.
We neither brag, nor tremble, faint nor entreat,
Our merrits nothing, yet our hopes are great,
Yet this our Author bad me boldly speak,
His play shall pass, let Envy swell and break,
Detraction he scorns, honors the best,
Ta^ti for hate; thus low to all the rest.

Welcome gallants, welcome honored bloods; the reason that we have vncloth'd us of
our princely government in Arcadia, and have to do with this private
retirement here in this defart I Will, you shall find in that shedule, only thus
much for public satisfaction: It Is not strange to you, that the choicest
treasure Nature endowed us with, is mind up in the veins of my two daughters:
how much their quiet, and the smothe stream of our government in Arcadia, was
troubled by the impetuous concourse of unruly suitors, is familiar with your
knowledge; this to avoid, I have for my Image there in my absence appointed my
brother, and undertook this private retirement


Why my lord, are you so covetous of your daughters beauties, that their
perfections shall be a means to hinder their preferment


Rather to further it fair Queen: they are the only pearls of our age, and
to see them well set in honorable and wel-befittin

Marriage, is our wishes happiness.
To which effect we have sent a general challenge
To all the youthful bloods of Africa,
That whosoever (borne of princely stem)
Dares foot the bosom of this desert I Will,
(The stage where I Will perform this lovers prize)
And by his wit and active policy,
Woo, win, entice, or any way defeat
Me of my charge, my daughters of their hearts,
Shall with their loves wear my imperial crown
Wreathe of their conquest.

A prize, a prize, rare work for Fencers.


What coward would not venture a cracked crown for such a booty?


To that intent our Island is fenc't in
By sea and Land, and at each corner built
A Castle for defense, which like great men
Do ouer-looke Archadea: over which,
We have appointed Captains. More to desire,
Is more then we are willing to discover.

Well then sister, I see we must to hap-hazard for husbands.


God send me one with a good face and I care not.


Love and be thy will, send me one with a fair table in his forhead, like
Time


Nay, and his face be good, let me alone to trick his forehead, a
country-gentlewoman taught me how: But father I wonder how you dare undertake
such a peremptory challenge against all co^mers, considering you have been so
long troubled with an Ague


An ague? what ague?


Why your quotidian, Dametas the Court surfeit, he that dwells in your eye,
like a disease in your blood


And the Presence were not exceeding empty-stomackt, it would never digest
such Almes-basket-scraps, the very fall and garbidge of gentry; fie upon him,
he becomes the great chamber worse then a Gentleman-usher with wry legs


He is the most misshapen suit of gentility that ever the Court wore.


Had he not been of my fathers own making, I should ha condemnd his tailor
for an exceeding botcher


If you retain the love of children, or the duty of subjects, express it in
your obedience, we know Dametas loves us


As Captains and Courtiers do old widows, for profit and preferment.


In sign whereof we make him.


Nay, you have bestowed too much of the making of him up already.


The very making of him up, has stood you in more then the whole our sides
worth


In my free thoughts you wrong him, therefore to express our love, and to give
the world public note of his loyalty, we create him your Guardian


How father, my Guardian.


I mynion, yours.


Do you hear father, bid him bespeake Spectacles, for my fingers have vowed to
have a blind match with his eyes


Well said Haggart, I Will make your proud heart stoop to the lure of obedience.
But come, by this time our challenge is published, and our gallants wits
sweating in the field of Invention, and it behoues us not to rest unexercised

So to our lodge, in the mean time be it known,
Our breath has power to raise, or cast men down.

Now Captain Observation, times bawd, thou that have kept the Ages door,
whilst vp-start baseness crept into the bed of greatness, what do thou
think of this change


That it pleased the Duke, and becomes not subjects to examine his actions.


That's no part of my meaning, yet would I gladly be better instructed why the
Duke broke up his Court in Archadea, and removed it into this Island


I am not Secretary to his thoughts, but the general mmour is, that out of
the freenes of his spirit, he has sent a challenge to all his neighbor
Princes, that who soever (within a twelve month) can defeat him of his
daughters, shall with their loves, enjoy his dukedom, the garland proposde for
the victors


Your words throw sense into me, and that's the cause the Island is so surely
guarded with watch-towers, over which our selu^^ and other Captains have the
charge


And to the end, that not affection, but desert may prove victor, are the two
Ladies so narrowly obserud, the one never out a the eye of her Father, the
other continually in the lodge of Dametas, the Dukes chief director


If inquisitiveness be not too bold a guest, what do you think of Dametas.


As of a little hillock, made great with others ruins.


Your comparison holds, for by report, his avarice has unmade many to make him
up


How did he first stumble on the Princes favor?


As some do upon offices, by fortune and flattery, or as truth says, the
Prince having one day lost his way, wandering in the woods found this Dametas,
affected his discourse, took him along to the Court, and like great men in
love with their own doings, countenanct his defects, gave him offices,
titles, and all the additions that g^e to the making up of a man worshipful


I cannot but commend the Duke for raising him, nor yet praise him, that he
proportions not his carriage aunswerable to his fortunes


Your thoughts and mine are twynnes in that: but I hear the warning bell, some
strangers are arrived


Lets to our office then, and conduct them to Dametas, whose custom is to spet
and hem, whilst his scribe Mayor takes they^ Examinations


Manasses, how do like my play at Tennys?


You play well Sir, but you loose still.


Pollecie Manasses, policy, for when any man vpbraides me with my gettings at
Court, I may swear truly I have lost more then I have got byte


By the Tennis court I think you have.


If by any Court, it is enough to save mine oath.
But what do our spruce witted gallants say of my bounty.

Faith sir according to the proportion of it, little or nothing they say it is a
banckrout, and dares not show his head


Then let em leave resting at me, though it please the Duke for some few good
parts that he sees in me, to make me his familiar, I scorn to be public, or
every Courtiers companion: but who comes here

The Captains of the watch-towers? what news with you.


A couple of peticioners, ant like your worship.


Had I best take their peticions Manasses?


O in any case, though you never peruse em, it is the only course in request.


Fellows, deliver your peticions to my scribe Mayor, and do hear, put em up
Manasses, they may be wrongs to us


And they be, I hope they be not the first wrongs I have put up for your
worship


That fellows pocket is like a Taylers hell, it eats up part of every man's
due: it is an Executioner, and makes away more innocent petitions in one year,
then a red-headed hang man cuts ropes in an age


Now, what are you sir?


A poor soldier ant like your worship.


Poor soldiers do not like my worship, they are bad members.


Then if they had a woman to their Judge, they should be sure to be cut off,
for they cannot endure badde members in a Commonwealth


What are you?


A poor scholar, ant like your worship.


Poor scholars do not like our worship neither, they rail against rich
Cormorants, they are bad members to


Cut them off both sir, and make the Land an Eunuch.


I Will take order with em I warrant thee, and I may have my will, I Will ha neither
poor scholar nor soldior about the Court


The next way to make it the I Will of fools.


What Is he talks of fools there? why how now sir, know you to whom you speak?


Cry your worship mercy, I had forgot your authority.


But I remember well enough I warrant you, I command you, in my name and the
Dukes, to attend your guard, and you regard me no more then a careless Lawyer
does an undone clyant, but I Will inform: the Duke shall know, out, pack


Command your slaves sir, we are gentlemen.


Why so I hope are we sir, and of the best and last edition, of the Dukes own
making


Cry your authority mercy, will you discharge us of these passengers?


You are dischargd, about your business.


Bad fate, that wrong should set his foot on right, And true borne Eagles
stoop to this base kyte


What an excellent trade it is to be an officer maker, I Will have more officers,
and one shall be to keep scholars and soldiers out of the Court, for they
dare not come in the great Chamber already, for want of good clothes. But gods
me Manasses, go tell the Duke I must speak with him


Presently sir, I Will go fetch the head to give the foot a posset: and my
master had wit to his villainy, he would make an excellent dish for the
hangman


Right worshipful.


I sir, I know my place is worshipful, I tell thee knave I could hang thee by
my pattent, if it were granted once, I Will tell thee how it runs, It allows
me 24 knaves, 6 Kinghts, 10 fools, 13 fellons, and 14 traitors by the year,
take em how, why, when, and where I please


I do not think the Duke will ever grant it.


Why not grant it? why should you think he will not grant it. Such another word
and I Will send you to Limbo instanthe


We thank you good Dametas.


I hope you will take reasonable bail for our forth-comming.


The case is alterd with you since you came out of Archadea.


My honorable friends, Iulio and Aminter, my self and the best ability of my
power, lies at your service


You see how confidentlie we presume upon your Letters promise, in furthering
us to attain the lovers prize


The Dukes daughters are your own, and in a word thus shall you attain em,
some 3 days hence I will appoint a hunting, to which I will invite the Duke
and both his daughters: in this hunt will I upon some sudden occasion divide
the train* and having singled out the two Does, I hope you have wit enough to
strike


To strike, how mean you.


As headsmen do, of with their maiden-heads, or if the Duke offer resistance,
of with his crown to


That were violence, and clean opposite to the intent of the challenge.


Come ye are shallow, to it vi et armis, to it, I Will be your second, think of
the crown, ha my Letters trauaild for you, my wit wrought for you, and my
invention sweat for you, to possess you of your loves, and seat you in the
Dukedom, and come you now with it is violence, and against the intent of the
challenge, I am ashamd to hear you


Nay Dametas, and your resolution be so forward, ours shall ouer-take you, we
doubted least the preferments your Lord has heapt upon you, had smotherd your
affection to us ward


That was the father that begot the doubt in us, you will appoint the hunt.


Sever the Duke, divide the train, and then.


We ha your meaning.


Put it in execution then, but first entertain some new disguise, as at our
next meeting I Will inform you. Adieu, I shall think long till I see you again


As a Lawyer does for his clyant for a second see. Heeres no Judas?


Yes, and a damnd one to, for he would betray and sell his Master.


It Is common in such base fellows, such Court-spyders, that weaue their webbes
of flattery in the ears of greatness, if they can once entangle them in
their quaint treachery, they poysen em straight


They are like unnecessary worms, who^ the son of greatness creates of the
gross and slimie multitude, as soon as they recover strength, they eat into
the credit of true borne gentry, undermine and work out the true nobility,
to inroote and establish themselves


And in the end, like Esops starved snake, having lapt the sweet milk of
greatness, made themselves strong in authority and friends, they turn their
stings of envy into their preseruers bosom


The example lives in this Dametas, who notwithstanding the Duke has raisd him
to that height that he looks equal with himself, yet for the base hope of
incertaine government, he offers him to sale, but let his treason live to the
last minute


For my part I Will make that use of him that Physicians do of poison, use as much
of him as serves for mine honest intent, and cast down the rest, as unfit for
any necessary employment


Let our carriage in this attempt put on no show of violence either to the
Duke, or his daughters


And let our discourse go so smoothly apparrelled, that it move not the
patience of the most tender ear


About it then, though his intent be base,
Our enterprise shall wear a noble face.

Archadea, thou heaven, within whose sphere
The star that guides my motion is fixed,
I court thy gracious bosom with a kiss
For this admittance: in thine amorous arms
Fair Violetta, fayrer then the flower
That christened her, and graced her with that name
Do play the wanton:
Only her Father like a covetous Churl,
Owner of that vnvalewed Diamond,
Has made this desert I Will th'vnwilling chest
In which he locks her. But the fair advantage
Of this large challenge, and my stars to friend,
Aided by this disguise, I shall break open
His iron Casket, and enlarge my hope.

This way she went sir, this way.


But I say this way, I would thou should know, we old Courtiers can hunt a
Cony, and put her to the squeake, and make her cry out like a young married
wife of the first night


For more help, as some of them have done,
But there she is.

I Will upon her presently, do hear me firra, thou vessall of infirmity,
woman, and by thy outside little better then one of the wicked, come hither
and show thy self before us, show thy self before Dametas


Dametas, Lisander then dissemble,
For he is the man must work thy entrance.

What art thou, speak.


My mother is the Queen of Amasons,
My self a virgin, married unto Arms
And bold archieuements, who have paced the world
In quest of fair Autioste my sister:
And turning homeward, the inconstant winds
And wrathful Neptune cast me on this shore.

And what is your business now you are landed?


My business is private with the Duke.


The Duke is busy, and shall speak with no body.


I beseech you sir.


It Is no beseeching matter I assure you.


No, never beseech for the matter, for except you could beseech with the tongue
of Angels, it is to no purpose with him


It Is strange, I have heard thy master is a very good man where he takes.


True, where he takes he is, but he takes nothing of you, and therefore look
for no kindness from him


Good, and do thou take after thy master?


No madam, I take commonly before my master, for where he takes, he takes all,
and leaves nothing for me to take


Oh, I feel your meaning.


Let my master have some feeling of yours, and heel preset your suit.


It Is not the Dukes pleasure Peticioners should buy their access.


Als one, it is my masters pleasure, and usual fashion.


And I must maintain the fashion. Worshipful Dametas, my late shipwreck as
you see, has made a defeat both of my friends and treasure, notwithstanding,
Fortune has reserved me one Jewel, which if I might request your worship in
love to accept, and be a means to work my admittance to the Duke, I should
become a true detter to your love


Well Madam, tho I hate nothing more then a man that takes brybes, yet pressed
by your importunity, and that you tender it in love, least I might seem too
nice to withstand a Ladies favor, I Will wear it for your sake, and if the Duke
be not too busily imployd, work your access


So doing, you shall perform the office of a dere-bought friend.


How quickly the tyde's turnde, but do you hear Madam, tho I take neither
before nor after my Master, yet take my counsel, and do not trust my master:
If you have a suit to the Duke keep it to your self, for if you trust my
master with it, heel prefer it for you, but heel begd for himself


That's plain coosnage.


Fie no, it is cunning in him, marry twould be though little better then
coosnage in a country gentleman: but he returns


Madam, I have been earnest, very earnest with the Duke for your admittance.


And have you wrought it?


I have, marry you must think I bestowd much labor int.


Tmay be you did.


Tmay be you did: and look a seance like a Pothecaries wife pounding
Colliquintida, have my brains sweat for this


Why the Jewel is right Dametas, had I but an Ass that would sweat me such
pearl


An Asle? and sweat such pearl, I Will bar her admittance, here take your
Jewel, the Duke will allow no admittance, and I will keep you back


Keep me back, thou could do no more and I were a poor man's peticioner.


And I Will do so much being a rich peticioner.


You cannot sir. You Court spaniell, you unnecessary mushrump, that in one
night art sprung out of the root of greatness, I have bought my admittance, and
I Will hate in dspetto del fato


I must admit her, these Ladies are so inward with our tricks, there is no good
to be done upon them: well Madam, your admittance is open, will ye follow


With all my heart sir, I Will be the blind man and poor peticioner, and thou
shall play the Court spaniell with the silver bell, and I cad me into the
Presence


Court spaniell? mum: I Will bosom what I think,
Old Gibs not blind, I see although I wink.

Boy, how do like me in this attire?


As the audience do a bad play, scuruely.


Is it not strange a prince should be thus metamorphosed?


Not so strange as the metamorphosis of Ajax and like your grace.


Grace you Aggot: have not forgot that yet?


No, and yet it is a wonder I ha not, grace being so fildome used, I Am sure they
say none at some Ordenaries, for at sitting down they cannot intend it for
hunger, and at rising up, they are either drunk, or have such mind a dice,
they never remembe^^, my Lord then


No more Lord, sir.


Indeed there are many already, but is not this strange, that rich men should
forsake their titles? master then


Your will sir.


You have left many Countries behind you in seeking your friend Lisander, and
yet you cannot find him


True sir.


I ha seen much gold lying upon Lombards stalls, and could never finger
penny of it


Very well.


Nay, it was not well sir.


What conclude you then?


That you were best sit down, and see what you ha got by your journey.


I have seen a face as beautiful as heaven.


That's nothing, a prisoner sees the face of heaven it self, when he looks
but out at the prison-gate, I Will stand root, a man were as good be hanged, so a
meet a handsome hangman, and a strong rope, as be in love


Your reason for that.


Mary this sir, hanging is end of all troubles, and love the beginning. Nay
further, I think a Lo^d cannot be saved, for he is of all religions


Your proof for that.


This; he thinks with the Atheist there is no GOD but his Mistress, with the
Infidel no heaven but her smiles, with the papist no purgatory but her frowns,
and with the family of love, hold it lawful to lie with her, though she be
another man's wife


So sir, what follows?


Serving men sir, the Master goes in before his wife, and the seruingman
follows his master


Syrra forbear, I must meditate.


As the Usurer before he parts with money, meditate upon the assurance.


I^ Violettaes presence ha not quenched
The memory of all things but herself,
I should be more familiar with that fate.

I have left my country to seek out my friend.


And I my country and my friend for love.


And in the search of him have lost my self
In the strange Region of a woman's eye.

In love, and in Archadea.


As much as heaven transcends the humble earth,
So towers her praise, her face differs as far
From others, as a glo worm from a star.
She is a princess that my soul affects.

And rich.


Half heir unto this Dukedom.


And she were whole heir to the four morrall Virtues, twere nothing: when
shall I see the time that men will love for virtue, or a rich h^yre marry a
poor wench without a portion, never I think


Had not my friend Lisander.


What of me?


L(...)nt in Thrace.


We had never met in love,
His sillables betray him. I arrest you.

At whose suit.


Not at his Taylers in any case, for there is no greater stitch to a younger
brothers conscience, then to pay for a suit of appariell when it is worn out


Lisander or his ghost.


Demetrius,
Or some illusiue tenant in his shape.

Unkind, why did thou leave my company?


For that which made the amorous Gods leave heaven,
For love: but why is Demetrius thus disguisd?

For that which would make a lackanapes a Monkey, and he could get it: a tail.


Peace rogue.


Why wagge, is thy master in love?


Faith sir he has entered his action in Cupids court, and means to proceed in
the suit it should seem


Why did not take my counsel in thy choice?


Because I feared a chiding, for doubting thine honorable thoughts would not
have consented to my effeminate attempts, I stole this secret course, and
manner of disguise, as best helping to access, which it has begot, now what
access will bring forth, I commit to unborn Industry


It cannot but be prosperous: only the strict observance of our loves, hinders
the passage of our hopes


Indeed that's not the least hinderance, yet the Duke himself, and my quaint
disguise has removed it out of my way, who not only takes me for a woman,
but has allowd me for my loves companion


Fortune deals kindly with thee, I am as far from access to my love, as
when I was in Thrate


Dametas is the oystershell that holds thy pearl, our wits must fish for him.


Will the Cods head byte?


Like an old Usurer at a young heirs inhe^^tance, and I h'ate ready hookt for
him: and he ere he comes, my plot is to preferr^ thee to his service


Prithee do, and I Will serve him in his right kind.


Dametas, my love is yours.


Which madam I am as proud of


As a malecontent of a change, or an old Lady of a new fashion.


To be round I have a suit to you in the behalf of this woodman


To me sweet blossom, tho I be somewhat strict in mine office, I cannot be stony
to Ladies. Fellow is thy petition drawn


Peticion.


Your only way to move a (...) by: Humbly complaining to your good worship, O
it is most pathetick, and indeed without money, can do just nothing with
authority


Come hither stripling whose son were thou?


I am not so wise a child as you take me for, I never knew^ my father.


Did not know thy father?


A common fault, his betters forget themselves when they grow rich, then blame
not him to forget his father


What was his name?


If I may give credit to my mother, they called him Menalchas, who on his
deathbed made me his heir, with this charge, to seek your worships service,
and gave me this gold as a remembrance to purchase your favor


Gold him?


Now does my Master long more to finger that gold, then a young girl married
to an old man, does to run her husband? ashore at Cuckolds haven


Well, I could do for this fatherless youth.


As many Executors and Overseers have done, cheat him of his portion, and
then turn him out of doors a begging


But for I have the guardian ship of the Prince, I dare do nothing without the
consent of the Duke


Come come sir, your worship shall not refuse him.


Well then I woe not, but it is for your sake I assure you.


Meaning the gold.


What shall I call thy name?


Dorus ant like your worship.


Ah, good Dorus, be an honest youth Dorus, reverence your Master, and love
your self: be sure to get under me, and you shall loose nothing in my service.
Madam, the Duke and Duchess expect you at the hunt, and await your coming at
Dianaes oak


I Will attend them presently, be a good servant Dorus.


Twill be his own another day Madam.


In the mean time let it be yours to lead the way.


My service does attend you,


As the Purseuant does the prisoner for a double fee.


Welcome slave to a slave, a fair presage,
The hope of love sweetens loves vassalage.

Now and Dametas be the mettle he was stamped for, a right villain.


And he be not, hang him.


Nay he deserves hanging to if he be: but will you trust him?


Yes as far as I see him, and he that trusts him further my trust is he will
be deceiud


Indeed, he that will prove false to his maker, will be true to no man.


Yes for the present time, like a bawd to him that gives most.


That's not for love.


Yes of the money: he that looks for other love in this age. This is the place
his Letter speaks of, and here he comes himself


Why so lo: now is the web of my hopes upon the loombe of perfection, and in
this quech of lashes Aminter and Iulio

See and see not, all mum, you know your que,
The games your own, if you can hunt it true.

Dametas, were thine ears ever at a more musical banquet? how the hounds
mouths like bells are tuned one under another like a slothfulnes, the speed of
the cry out-ran my sense of hearing


Cross over the Forest to Dianas oak my liege, and there your grace
advantagde by the height of the ground, shall not only at pleasure hear, but
be eye-witnes of their musical contention


Thanks good Dametas, be thy directions our wives conuoy.


Where is his highness Dametas?


At Adonis bower Madam, where he expects your presence to see the fleshing of a
couple of Spartane hounds, in the wasting blood of the spent Dear


Thanks good Dametas, mine eyes would not be good friends with my feet,
should they not bring em to that kingly sport


Sweet Ladies, to save you the expense of much breath* which must be laid out
in the purchase of the game. I have provided you this stand, from whence your
eyes may be commanders of the sport: such sport as you little dream of


We are your loves detters kind Dametas.
As I love virtue I pity these poor beasts,
These Syluane comoners, to see what taskes
Our covetous Forresters impose upon them,
Who not content with impost of their breath,
(Poor hearts,) pursue them smiling to their death.

It Was the end of their creation Madam.


So was the end of ours to live in peace,
And not to tyrannise on harmless beasts,
But Forresters, like Images set forth
The tyranny of greatness without pity,
As they the Dear, so covetous wealth pursues
The trembling state of their inferiors.
And to claspe up the volume of their sins,
They drink their blood, and clothe them with their skins,
Then cease to press poor beasts with tyranny,
You love your lives, think they are loath to die.

You are too tender-harted to be a good huntswoman lady.


And some of you too hard-harted, but leaving this discourse of hunting, have
all our gallantry of Lacedemon and Greece, spent the vigor of their wits, that
not one dares venture


For our loves sister, you may see the properer women, the worse luck.


Tush you shall have suitors, fear not madam.


No at any hand sister, for with a fear it comes.


Then I Will fear of purpose, because I would have em come.


And they do not, they are notable cowards.


Then let em keep away still, for I have vowed my maidenhead shall never do
homage to the bed of a coward


Sweet Ladies, will you beguile a minute or two with this discourse, till I
step up to the top of the hill, and make discovery of the game


Let your return be speedy good Dametas.


I Will put on wings and fly.


Out of the Court, and the whole Country shall have a good riddance.


So, he has put em fair to the stand, lets issue and surprise them,


Be resolute and sudden.


Murder, treason, reskue, help.


Yes much reskewe, much help, much Dametas: why so, this lest was drawn home
close to the head, it cannot choose but cleave the very white of our hopes, the
Dukes wit ^to thy tackle good wit, some sudden sea room, or our stratagem is
run a ground


Tell me Dametas, was not the Dear a prodigal, did he not spend his breath
freely amongst us


And his blood too my liege, but did you observe how the hounds like
politicians nosd out the game


True: and coming to the loss Melampus, but where are our daughters?


Did you observe that my liege, that Melampus as a true hound is ever horce
cheerd or hollow, yet he kept time to


Certain Dametas, but where are our daughters man?


Busy my Lord under a brake bush, disputing of the virtue of sweet water, and
ground Iuie


What cry of treasons that Dametas?
Pray God no danger sets upon my daughters,
Seek out our wife, I Will have unto their reskue.

And my sword vn-imployd? allegiance: says nay to that my Liege, I am for the
adventure my self, if they be surprisd (I am a mad man) your grace shall
hear more: If not ((...) the more sorry) your grace shall hear more to: make
peace with your thoughts till my return, and doubt not their recovery


Speak, where is the Duke?


Here my Genitia.
What mean these weapons, are our daughters safe?

As a thief in a (...)ill father, we thank our redeemers.


The more my grief, were you surprisd then madam?


Yes says Dametas.


And how sweet Ladies, and how were you reskewd?


Being surprisd, this gallant Amason
Pressed to their reskew, had you seen what worth
She and this woodman spent in our defense,
Wonder would ha bereft you of all sense.
She raisde her sword with such a manly grace,
As had nor her mild sexe-contrould my thoughts,
I could have fallen in love with her high worth.

You over price us madam, not our dese^^
But the weak spi(...) of our opposites.
Gave leister to the di(...)nes of our worth.

It please your modesty to lesson it.
But it shall still live great in our regard. What woodmans that?

My follower my Liege.


What ere he be, he has deserved our love.
Fellow be near us, and for this desert,
Performd against those Traitors to our blood,
Under thy master we give thee an attendant,
To guard the life and safety of our daughter.

Thank you good father, who ever loose by the bargain, I ha got me a servant
by the match: wot serve me fellow


In the best I can.
In heart your fellow, though in show your man.

I Will try your du^ious service: I command,
Your knee to kiss the ground, your lip my hand.

Pardon me Madam.


Heeres hot love no doubt,
I may command my man, and go without.

Truce to this ayrie war, these paper bullets
Better become a Closset then a Park,
The Forest music is to hear the hounds
Rend the thin air, and with a lusty cry
Awake the drowsy Echo, and confound
Their perfect language in a mingled sound,
Then so the Court, our Forest sport being done,
A second chase o^ louelier sport's begun.

If fortune cross not what our hopes pursue,
Our fears have met their deaths, our loves their due.

Crossed in my hopes, the Ladies reskewd, and the Princes like crauens beat out
of the game-place, my invention must turn trauailer for more stratagems^ what
and I should discover their plot to the Duke, attach em for traitors, and beg
their lands for my labor; though they be my friends, twere a pretty parcel of
policy

All things are lawful that do profit bring,
A wise-mans bow goes with a twofold string.

Did ever two princes meet such strange changes in their loves? now we have
wrought our admittance, and in a manner got em into our possessions, ou^ hopes
like false fires having brought us within ^en, vanish, and leave us out of all
comfort


That the duke should doat upon thee for a woman, makes for our purpose, but
that the duchess should be enamourd on thee for a man, is prepostrous


Whether my (...) sh^wne in the reskue of the Ladies, or the ardent glances
her daughters beauty steals from mine eyes, give her thoughts encouragement, I
know not, but her hopes stand confident I am a man, and for that cause am I
bard from access


I way thy co(...)rances by mine own, for tho by the Dukes allowance I am her
privileged attendant, yet such is the deuilishnes of Dametas, that I cannot
joy so much access as to confer with her


I can compare my lord and his friend to nothing in the world so fitly as to a
couple of water buckets, for whilst hope winds the one up, despair plunges the
other down, whilst I like a Harl^kene in an Italian comedy, stand making faces
at both their follies


Well, since the shape of our proceeding grows so monstrous, lets cast our
inventions in a new mold, and having so firm a foundation as this disguise to
build upon, lets draw the model, and raise the whole frame of our attempts
anew


Indeed, lovers should be conditiond like tyrants, who having the aim of a
crown in (...) violently over all lets that intervent their course, and so
must we


And so will we, my resolutions already bent, and if I shoot not, the next
level I take, (...) I beseech thee break thy bow about mine ears, and strike
the horns in my forhead, for married men to hang their caps on


I have met a means (...) my purpose already: Mopsa Dametas only daughter, is
(...) in love with me, and to her I Will feign extreme ardor of affection, and
make her the shadow under which I Will court the true substance of my divine
Hippolita


About it then, I Will sweat my invention to death but I Will overtake thee; but
here comes one of my (...). I must hear his importunity, for no reasonable
denial will brush him of


Zehnane.


My Liege.


My thoughts come like a sail before the wind, swollen big with news and thine
ears the midwife must deliver me of this burden, my Duchess is sick, heart
sick for thee Zelmane


For me, why my Lord, I am no Rosasolis, nor Aqua mirabilis to recover sick
folks


Shall I be short with thee? My Lady's in love with thee.


With me my Lord.


With thee my Lady: her amorous glances are her accusers, her very looks write
Sonnets in thy co^mendations, she carues thee at board, and cannot sleep for
dreaming on thee in bed, she is turned sunne-riser, haunts private walks, and
like a disgrast Courtier, studies the Art of melancholy


Now alas good Lady.


Nay never pity her, she deserves none, rather lets bend our endeavors to
entangle her more. To see the kindness of Fortune, who fearing we should be
acquainted with sollitude in this our 12 month retirement, has begot a
domestical merriment, and made our own thoughts actors int, and as bad a Poet
as I am, I Will ha one scene int of mine own invention


Dametas will storm at that, for he cannot endure Poetry should be
countnanst: but how is it my Liege


It Is ready plotted already, and that the Duchess may not find thee unprovided
when she comes to court the


Court me, court a woman my Liege.


Why that's the very happiness of the jest, but in any case confess thy self
a man


A man my liege, I ha no color fort.


Tush I Will furnish thee, say thou art some Prince, no matter who, and have to do
with this disguise of purpose to court my daughter Violetta


Is this scene of your own inuenting my liege?


Mine own in faith, and to confirmt the rather, use more often and private
conference with my daughter, interchange discourse and amorous dalliance, oh
twill set my Duchess affections a flre, to think her riuald by her daughter,
and give us smooth passage to our love


How occasion plays the wanton with me. Well my liege, do but you work my
admittance to your daughter, and I Will bestow all the art I am worth in courting
her, and see, as if Fortune had a hand in our Comedy, she has entered the
Duchess just at her que, shadow your self in your Arc, and leave me to give
her entertainment


Forget not to personate some Prince in any case.


I Will warrant you, I Will play the Prince with much art.


This way he went, on this sweet violet bed
Still dwells the print of his enamourd tread,
The deprest flowers have strengthened their sweet
By stealing amorous kisses from his feet.

Absolute Poet, Penelope was a ballet-maker to her.


Oh do not fli^ my presence, gentle wanton stay,
What have I found you, faith you runaway
I Will tie a chain about your wast for this,
And make you buy your freedom with a kiss.

Fie madam, this courtesy is more then needs*


Be not so coy, let not a loving Dame
Find thee less kind then senseless elements,
Thou never walkst, but the enamourd air
Like an officious lover bears thy train,
Whilst the cool wind does with his velvet wing
Fan the thin air upon thy sweatie cheek,
Stealing sweet kisses from thy silken lip.

Shield this vain breath, beat at some ladies ear.


But you are none, you are not, come you are not,
Your valor, looks, and gesture show you are not,
Your manly brow, and your commanding eye,
Where war and fortune dwell in majesty,
Your private walks, and varied passions,
Your glances to my daughter, sure you are not,
And my firm love is confident you are not.

There Is a lover of a right temper, she will outface the name of her sex
instantly


Well madam, since your observation has discouerd me, upon promise of your
secrecy I confess my self a man


Good, excellent, how truly she takes my directions.


I knew my judgment could not be deceiud,
Nor durst proud love have done me so much wrong
To cast my thoughts unto a woman's eye.

Love durst not, good, good, excellent, what next.


But madam, now I am known to you, what further request you.


Exchange of looks, and freedom of thy bed,
Thy presence, thy embracements, thy kind love,
For which my amorous thoughts have long line sick.

Thank you good wife, nay and a Duchess long to give her husbands the horning,
let it never grieve butchers to do homage at Cuekolds haven


Well madam, to give content to your affections, and in a strong hope you will
mediate my suit to your daughter, sort out but fit time and opportunity, and
master your desires


And he were a man now I might be rarely tupt.


Give me thy hand then, with this amorous kiss I seal thee mine.


And I confirmt with this.


Rare, rare, rare, she is his sealed and deliuerd in the presence of her husband.


Now least my husband should suspect our love,


Now, what shadow for that now.


Hear a good jest, persuade him thou art a woman.


That's not to do now madam, for he as confidently belieues and ardently courts
me for a woman, as you for a man


Good, excellent, maintain that humor still,
Seem coy, look nice, and as we weomen use,
Be mild and proud, embrace, and yet refuse.

Excellent virtues in a woman.


I prithee do, twill be a scene of mirth
For me to quote his passions and his smiles,
His amorous hauiour, and how his eye
Will beget strange variety of looks.
And shoot em into thine, but the chief sports this
To see an old man with a young man kiss.

To see an old Duchess a young Lady kiss.
Now the plot packs the scenes all comicall,
I cannot speak for laughter, to see these women
That would be counted wonders for their wit,
Lay plots to gull themselves, silly conceit,

To take me for a man.


And arm herself
To laugh at me, make jests and scoffs at me,
But sooth her humor, the revenge sheede throw
Upon my head, shall fall on her own brow.

Upon you both, so, so, so, how greedily their inventions like bugles follows
the sent of their own gullery, yet these are no fools, God forbid, not they:
but to the drift, mirth in my warm blood sits, laughing at this division of
their wits


Wot te believe me sister, I never eat a cherry, but it puts me in mind of a
husband, it kisses my lips with such a harmless prettines


Now in good deed lo I love em a life to, I think I shall never ha my belly
full on em


Of what, not of husbands Violetta.


No, of cherries Hipolita, but take heed of em, they be a ver^e filling meat,
and dangerous things for us maids I can tell you, we may surfeit after em
presently


Surfeit after what, a husband?


I and after cherries to Hippolita.


I warrant you sister, an old lady in Lacedemon taught me a preservative
against that


For the love of cherries what.


Marry this it was, still said she, betwixt every cherry said she, be sure to
crack a stone said she


Then let me alone, I Will crack a couple a stones betwixt every cherry, rather
then surfeit on em


You must take heed you crack not too many to, for you may surfeit of the
stone as well as of the cherry


Nay and they be such dangerous things, I have done with em.


So have I to for this time, but sister, is it not a strange kind of servile
liberty that we live in here in Archadea


For all the world as Englishmen keep their fellons, and Italians their wines,
we never stir abroad without our Iaylors


And for what cause forsooth, only to keep us from marriage.


Sure it is either some high content, or extreme discommoditie, that our father
debarrs us of it


By this stone me thinks I long like a woman with child, till I know the
difference betwixt a maid and a wife


Well, god a mercy of all cursen souls, I was near the knowledge ont last
night I can tell you


O that I had been with thee I might ha been so to: for love of marriage how?


Why thus: as I lay slumbering in my bed,
No creature with me but my maydenhead:

Is that a creature?


Some maintain it is.
Got in the eye, conceived in a kiss:
Others whose speech seem near akin to truth
Say it is a passion, bred ith heat of youth,
Some callt a sigh, and some an amorous groan,
All differ in the definition,
But in the allowd opinion of most,
It Is never truly had till it be lost.
But lying thus alone, as maids do use,
Me thought I dreampt, as maids can hardly choose,
And in my dream me thought it was too much wrong
A pretty maid should lie alone so long:
With that a gallant comes, gallants can do
Much with young maids,

And with old women to.


He couted me once, and again, and thrice,
It Is virtue to say nay, to be too nice
Agrees not with my humor, yet some say,
We maids wish things, to which we answer nay,
Breefely me thought he stood so long a wooing,
I rather could a wished he had been doing
Some other business, yet at last we greed,
Twere strange if earnest suitors should not speed.

In what agreed you?


In our wedding ring,
Time, place, and hour, indeed in every thing:
The day appointed, and each thing in frame,
I thought each hour an age until it came,
Well, come it is, the morning once in sight,
I thought it ten times longer till it was night.
At dinner time me thought I sweld with pride
To be drunk to by name of Mistress bride,
Music spoke loud, no delicates were scant,
Yet still me thought another thing did want,
For sure thought I, there is something in a man
That wives love well, hope brides may wish it than.
Long looked for comes at last, to bed we go.

Would I had dreampt I might ha done so to.


My bed-mate turned, and as he would ha spoke
I swe^t with fear, and in that fear I woke,
But seeing my kind bedfellow was gone,
Lord how it chaft me that I wakt so soon,
One minutes dreaming longer, I had tried,
The difference twixt a virgin and a bride.

O twould ha vexed a saint, my blood would burn
To be so near, and miss so good a turn.

And so did mine to I warrant you, nay tho I be but a little pot, I shall be as
soon hot as another


You should not be my sister else.


Nor my mothers daughter neither.


And in good earnest we are not fatherd much amiss.


Are you aui^d of that, and in faith tell me, what think you of your servant
Dorus


As of a sweet Almond in a rugged shell, the sun in a cloud, or a welthy
diamond in a rock, indeed clean contrary to the world, he wears the worst
side outward, and is much better then he seems: but what think you of your
manly Amazon


Nay the sport is I know not what to think, Zelmanes humor would afford
project for a pretty Court comedy, my father courts her for a woman, and as I
fear she is, my mother doares upon her for a man, and as I wish he were, and
that with such an ardor of affection, that I could find in my heart to turn my
mother out of the company, and play the lovers part my self


How ever man or woman, the jest holds current in one.


I know not what knauish motion has had to do with my thought, but my mind
tells me that your servant Dorus and my Amazon, are other then they seem: and
here he comes


Why how now madam, Ladies gadding, is this the obedience of your fathers
charge


Pardon Mistress Miso, it was my doing and the Dukes.


But the Duchess w^l like neither the Dukes doings nor yours neither in this
case I can tell you. The Duke stays your coming and yet the duchess is very
desirous ont, my husbands is in the next Arbor to man you. For you Lady, my
presence be your privilege


Miso should be either a hangman or a Herald, for she never comes amongst us,
but she quarters our company and arms


Excellent beauty, and therefore more excellent, because situate in so fair a
creature


You are a merry man Dorus, but all this cannot make me think you love me, how
say you mother does he


Mary let him chose daughter, when I was as thou art.


You were as she is, but faith madam Mopsa, I perceive my servant Dorus bears
a months mind to you, be not so straight laced to him. Mop. Straight laced,
sgod mend me I am not laced at all, am I Dorus, no in soth, I go wide open
wensday, I never lace my self but on sondaies, and that for fear I should
burst with eating of plum porridge. Hip. I mean let fall some comfortable
looks on your suter


sgod mend me I Will let fall or take up any thing I have to do him good.


Why that's kindly said, and Dorus your love is very ambitious, to climb so
hie as the beautiful Mopsa


O are you avisd of that, twold make a horse break his bridle to hear how the
youth of the village will commend me, oh the pretty little pincking nyes of
Mopsa says one, oh the fine flat lips of Mopsa says another, and then do I
bridle my head like a malt-horse thus, set mine arms a kembo thus, wrethe my
neck and my body thus, wink with one eye thus, and spread my peacocks tail
as broad as the proudest minx of em all


These extraordinary graces must not want admiration, but where is your mother.


Speak softly in the Lobby there, for waking my Ladies foisting hound.


Godsme, my mothers stealing of a nap.


Nay, she cannot be said to steal a nap, for the noise she makes herself
would discover her theft: but Dorus since your fortunes are poor, you should
study to enoble your deserts, and beget effects worthy to court and win your
Ladies acceptance


Less madam, I choose no better moderater then your self, betwixt me and my
unworthy services, suppose your self tho but a Cucko compard with this sweet
singing Nitingale, should be sued to by a prince like me, I mean like me in
love, for love in princes and pesants admits comparison: suppose Demetrius
should in like disguise court you as I do, Mopsa, sigh for you, as I do, for
Mopsa, kneel to you thus, as I do, to Mopsa, lay down his life to you, as I
do, to Mopsa, prefer your good before his own, as I protest I do, Mopsaes,
suppose he should show you the known mark of his neck, to assure you he were
Demetrius, as I do this to Mopsa, to witness I am the son of Menalchas, could
your disdain stand out like Mopsaes


What a kenes necessity sets upon the edge of invention, trust me Mopsa your
servant speaks well, and if he can prove himself the man he speaks of, and my
wishes well hope, Demetrius, you have no reason to think scorn of him


Why what should I do madam, my mother tells me I must not say as I think.


I am no counselor, but should Demetrius in like disguise court me, thus would
I embrace him, thus seal my affections with a kiss, and thus argue: think not
Demetrius that the clouds of baseness could so muffle thee, but that the sun of
valor shind through them long since, and in regard of thy serviceable duty in
concealing, and vnpre^ented policy in thus making known thy love, sort but out
fit opportunity, and in despite of all gardians strict observance, go where
thou will, the worth of Demetrius shall draw Hippolita, this would I vow, and
this will I perform


And were I Demetrius and you Hippolita, I would deciue Dametas, outreach Miso,
forswear Mopsa, and forsake Archadea to share the fortunes of divine Hippolita


And what should I do then?


I do but speak in the person of Demetrius, and under Hippolita shadow what I
intend to the rare, and never enough wondered at Mopsa, the black swan of
beauty, and madg-howled of admiration


Do not you flout me Dorus, and you do not, provide a priest and I Will marry you,
and my father and mother shall never know one


Manasses is the man.


And I Will be the woman, who so ever say nay toote, little dreams my mother of
what we have done


Tmay be she did, for she sighed and grond much in her sleep.


It Is well she was so quiet, for she eat pease poridge to breakfast, and they will
make me break wind in my sleep like a horse, and see as the devil will hate she
wakes, and here comes my father, no words and ye love me


Why god a mercy Dorus, this diligence becomes the servant of Dametas, and
I Will prefer thee fort


You were worse then the devil else, for they say he helps his servants, then
you may do little and you cannot help yours


Will you break your jests against the bars of you chamber window, and
clear the green, the duke is coming to bowls, and I would not for half
mine office you should be a rub in the way of his patience: Daughter and Wife,
conduct her to the Lodge. Dorus. make you haste about your business


I warrant you Sir: be my hopes rightly plast?
You will condemn me for my too much haste.

Why so: this it is to be in authority: Inferior persons, I and the Princes
themselves, fly from my presence, like the chirping Birds from the sight of
the Faulcon: my very breath like a mighty wind blows away inferior Officers
(the Court rubbish) out of my way, and gives me a smooth passage: I am the
morning star, I am seldom seen but about the rising of the Sun: indeed I
am never out of the Dukes eye; and here he comes


Does our match hold.


Yes, whose part will you take.


Zelmanes.


Soft, that match is yet to make.


Lets cast a choice, the nearest two take one.


My choice is cast, help sweet occasion.


Come, here is a good.


Well, betterd.


Best of all.


The Duke and I.


The weakest go to the wall.


I Will lead.


I Will follow.


We have both one mind.


In what?


In leaving the old folk behind.


Well iested daughter, and you lead not fair,
The hindmost hound, though old, may catch the hate.

Your last Boule come?


By the faith a me, well led,


Would I might lead you,


Whither?


To my bed.


I am sure you would not?


By this air I would.


I hope you would not hurt me, and you should.


I Would love you sweet.


Sour, so I heard you say.


Accept it then.


Of what acquaintance pray?


Of loves, and mine.


Daughter, your bowl winnes one.


None of my Maidenhead Father, I am gone,
The Amason has won one.

Yield to that.


The cast I do.


Your self?


Nay scrape out that.


Whose is it yet?


The Dukes: play smooth and fine,
The smallest help that is, will make your mine.

Me yours?


Your mine, for tho the cast I loose,
I ha won your love.

Much: in my the other hoose.


Come, the last market this cast is worth all the rest.


The leader as the follower.


Badd's the best,
I win her for ten crowns, and there they be.

I take your lay.


A match twixt you and me.


I Will be your half.


That were unkindly done.


Pardon me mother, I Will bear all or none.


I ha won you Madam.


Me?


I mean your bet.


Then take your winnings, i will not die in debt.


Madam believe me, I am as I protest, a Prince, my name Lisander.


Look to the Dukes standing Madam.


So I will I warrant you, and to your falling.


Thus clouded as you see, for your love, my soul speaks in my tongue: I
appointed this match at bowls a purpose to acquaint you with it


Bar stealing Father; yet and all hit right,
Here Is one would steal a piece of flesh to night.

Dear Madam.


No more words, I have perceived as much in your eye, as you can express with
your tongue, and as far as my mothers jealousy would give me leave, answered
it with kind looks: your bias stands wrong mother


Why? It stands toward Zelmanes.


Has it stood so long?


All the game through.


Then all your game's bold wrong: furnish you with necessaries befitting an
escape, and my will shall be as ready to take wing, as yours; put in a cast now
mother, or the game is gone indeed


Whose is the throw?


Ours, till the last bowl came.
But that has wont'em clear, both cast and game.

Our winnings come, a kiss and bate the rest.


What do you kiss in earnest or in jest?


In earnest in good truth.


Troth, kindly sed,
Take heed you kiss not out your maidenhead.

In jest?


In earnest.


It Is the fashion,
Much in request among our Nation.

To kiss away their maidenheads?


Now and then,
And being gone, to kiss it back again:
For lovers indentures are nea're fairly drawn,
Until the maidenhead be left in pawn,
As earnest of the match, so mothers sed,
And so will daughters do when Mams be dead.

What? pawn their maidenhead?


Yes, and loose'em too.


And you will maintain that fashion?


Signeor Noe.


Lay by this homebred mirth, and prepare your ears to entertain strangers.


Stranger? why Father, Strangers are as welcome to me, as mine own
Countrymen; if they bring good manners, and civil humanity in their company:
otherwise, they are like foul weather, come before they be sent for


Dometas, nay then we shall have news enough; for he never comes into the
Presence, but he brings a whole sack full of (...)es: of news I should say


Welcome Dametas: what officious fellow is that?


A pure welwiller of your Majesty's, and a follower of mine.


O it is Manasses; and he could make Arms as well as he mars Legs, he would grow
in great request for Heraldrie: What Is your news


These Lacedaemonians, Subjects to your Majesty, having a Messadge to deliver
to your Majesty's instruments of hearing, commonly eclipt, ears


How? Has any one here, clipped ears?


Sweet Femenine, clip off the tail of thy discourse with the Sissars of
attention, as I say, these Lacedaemonians have chosen me their tongue


Of a long tongue thou speakst very little.


That proves me no woman, for they speak over much.


What greuances oppress them? briefly speak.


Merchandise (my Ledge) through the avarice of purchasing Officers, is rackt
with such unmerciful Impost, that the very name of Traffic grows odious
even to the professor


Towns so oppressed for want of wonted and natural liberty, as that the native
Inhabitants seem Slaves, and the Forrayners free Denizens


Offices so bought and sold, that before the purchaser can be said to be
placed in his Office, he is again by his covetous Patron displac't


Common Riots, Rapes, and wilful Homicide in great men's followers, not only,
not punished, but in a manner countenaunced and aplauded


Indeed since your Majesty left the Land, the whole body of the
Commonwealth runs clean against the byas of true and pristine government


And your honorable Brother, like a Shipp toste upon the violent billows of
this Insurrection, by us intreates your Majesty's Letters of speedy
reformation, for fear the whole kingdom suffer inevitable shipwreck


Which after short deliberation with our Counsel, your self shall return.
Dametas, reward their trauayles with 200. Crowns: in the mean time, let them
taste the best entertainment of our Court

Proud Rebels, they shall see that a Dukes frown,
Can at his pleasure, turn Rebellion down:
See them rewar^ed.

Manasses, see the fellows entertaind; I must attend of the Duke.


Boy, see the fellows entertaind? I must wait of my lord.


Fellows, be as merry as you may, I must follow my M.


So, here is Peticioners attendance right; good words, and short commons: But
it is not their entertainment we come for. I made a simple shift to get
entertainment into the Court


Well Cupid, pray for our lives, for and we were gone, I know not where thou
would have two such statesmen again


His Commonwealth could not stand without us: and that his Mother knows well
enough: and he sends no better success then we had at our hunting, he looses
a friend of me


It Will not sink in my thought yet, but that old mustie slave Dametas playde
the slave with us


Would I could prove it once: but since we are again admitted our Realm,
shall we be idle? somewhat we will do, though they will give us but small thanks
for our labor


The Duke shall not say his Daughters are so ill beloved, but we will change a
thrust or two with his intent for'em


It Would put the poor Wenches out of conceit with themselves, and there should
not be some contending for'em


We are in the way to catch the old one, and then our aim deceiues not.


We are I faith: Invention could not weaue,
A quainter web, Suspicion to deceive.

Come, pass off this groueling imitation; a Lovers thoughts must be ambitious,
and like the Eagle, scorning the bace air where Kites and Crows lie flagging:
mount the clear sky of Invention, and ouerpeere al hindrances

The Ladies themselves are willing.

Ready to imbark upon the next tide of occasion whatsoever.


Let me alone to work it then. But here comes my Boy.


It Were more for your credit Sir, and you could say your man: but men and war
were worn out of fashion both in a So^mer


I am of thy belief in that, Boy.


Would my Lord were so to, Sir.


Suppose I were Sir what then?


I should (as many vpstartes have done) prove rich: for I believe you would
make me your heir


Is that part of your belief?


A principal point Sir.


Renounce it then, for I believe you will never besaud by it.


I am sure I cannot loose by it. I believe further, that many Knights, and some
Ladies, were never of Gods making


Of whose then, wagge?


I Will tell you: the Minters quoine Gold, Gold makes Heralds, Heralds make
Nnights, and Knights stamp Ladies


And what do Ladies?


They live not idly neither; they make some Knights, and mar many Gentlemen.


Ladies are good worke-women too, then?


Far better then any Tailor: they will make you an end of a suite, especially
a Court suite, when all the Tailors in a Country know not how to set a stitch
in it


I am of the belief you are a Knave, Sir.


I had no says, should I say you were not.


Well, what, a Knave?


In a Knaves belief Sir.


Because in yours?


Do you say it, and I Will swere't, my Lord.


No more Boy, I am weary of your iestes.


That coufirmes'em to be good Sir.


Your reason for that, Sir?


Because travelers and lovers, are soon weary of goodness.


Goodly ones in deed: but leaving this highway of circumstaunce; I sent you
for Manasses


The learned Scribe attendes you.


Will you fall off, Sir?


Like an Apple at Michaelmas, without shaking.


Welcome Manassas: I have present employment for thee, in which I must borrow


Pardon me Madame, I learned of my Lord, to lend nothing without security
and pawnes


It Is not money (Manasses) but counsel and furtherance that we desire.


Good counsel is worth good money, Madame.


Thou shall be well considered; there is twenty Crowns in earnest.


Nay Madame, this hand's like a fellow, it takes every thing in jest; if you
be in earnest, let me feel it here: So Lady, now betwixt earnest and jest,
if your Will be ready drawn, before your friend delivered as your deed, and
put me in trust to execute it


Take It, in a word this honest Shepherd, and thy Lords daughter Madame Mopsa,
are man and wife


Man, an woman perhaps; but not man and wife: for though most women have a will
to be Ladies, like my Lords wife; yet every Lady have not wit to be a wife,
as my Lords Daughter. But what good can I do in this


O very much: for though they be man and wife by oath and protestation, the
chiefest ceremony of all; namely Mariadge, is yet unperformed, and hearing
that you have taken orders


That I have: I have taken order for the making away of a hundred Maidenheads in
my time, and not so few: but I am in in the mind of you now, these two
Beagles, Dorus and Mops^, have run themselves breathless in the chase of love,
you would ha me couple'm up in the leases of Matrimony


You are in the right.


And you in the wrong, I Will keep your jest, but in any case take back again
your earnest: i will not purchase my Lords displeasure with your gold


Thy Lord shall never know it.


Oh sir! though my M. has but bad eyes, he has exceeding long ears: and
though a Forrayner may play with a Citizens wooden Dagger, I would not wish any
to jest with a Courtiers steeld Sword; it is seldom drawn but it draws blood


Tush man, be not so timorous, my credit shall countenance thee: be not an
Ass, make use of thy time: thy Masters service is no heritage; the world
knows he gettes under the Duke, thou art a fool, and thou will loose under
him: there is a hundred Crowns for thee; tush man, thy betters will strain
curtsey with aleagence for a bribe


Madam, could you to every one of these Crowns give me a Kingdom,


What then?


I should ha more ground then half the Kings in Christendom: here is my hand,
I Will do it: my M. is my M. and I love him; but my gold's my God, and I honor it:
I Will do it; the time and place


Soon in the evening at Adonis Chapel. Art resolute?


As your Adamant: think you it was fear made me keep out? no it was hope of
these flattering sweet lipt drabs, I fear to marry my Ladies daughter? no
nor to go to bed with her neither. Why, I have counterfaited his hand and
seal. He has been content with me, to come nearer to him, at his
entertainment of the last Ambassador, when he was heat with drinking of
healthes. As I led him to his Chamber, I nimde his Chain, and drew his Purse,
and next morning persuaded him he lost it in the great Chamber at the Revels.
He puts me in trust with his whole estate: he buys Manners, I purchase Farms:
he buildes houses, I pluck down Churches: he gets of the Duke, and I of the
Commons: he beggars the Court, and I beggar the whole Country


These are notable knauish courses. What breeding have had?


Very good breeding Sir: My great Graundfather was a Rat-catcher, my Grandsier
a Hangman, my Father a Promooter, and my self an Informer


Thou were a Knave by inheritance.


And by education too: but Bawdie Informations growing stale, I gave up my
cloak to a Broker, and crept into credit for a Gown, and of Manasses a
penurious Informer, I turned Coppie, and became Manasses, a most, precise, and
illiterate expositor


Were you a Reader then?


And a Writer too Bullie; I set some of my Parishioners Wives such Coppies, as
their Husbands might cast their cappes at it, but could never come near


But and you used such a high and eleuate style, your auditories low and humble
understandings should never crall ouer't


Tush I could fashion the body, of my discourse fit to the ear of my
auditorre: for to cast Eloquence amongst a company of Stinctards, is all one
as if a man should scatter Pearl amongst the hoggish animals ecliped Swine: no
I had paraphrasticall admonitions of all sorts; Some against covetous
Landlordes, and that would I squirt awongst beggarly Tennants: Some against
Usurers, and that would I throw in at Prison Grates amongst prodigal
Banqeoutes: Some against the pride of the Court, and that honies the ear of
the Citizen: Some against the fraud of the City, and that is Cake and Cheese
to the Country: Some against Protestants, and that is plumpes the lasie
Catholic against Papist and Protestant, and that fattens the rank witted
Puritand, against Papist, Puritand, and Protestant; and that tickles the ear
of the luxur ous Atheist


Why you never light upon any Atheistes, do you?


Oh very many.


In the Country perhaps, and the out-skirtes of the city?


In the very boosome of the City: and by your leave, here and there one in
the Court too: But we fi^t 'em all; for in deed we wandering Lights, have
(as other tradesmen have) Commodities of all sorts, and prises


How do they come by them?


As many do by Offices, steal into them ere the Duke be aware of 'em.


Some buy'em at Booke-sellers stalles; but the best they bespeake of Poets.


Me thinks Poets of all men, should not edify, they are so envious.


One to another, to no body else: a proud Poet is for all the world like a
Puncke in request, covetous of many Cliantes, when she has more then she can
handsomely play off: You shall have some Poet (Apolloes Vicar, especially)
write you a comicall, Pastoral, Tragical, Musical history in prose, will
make the auditors eyes run a water like so many waterspouts: I had one of
them my self, and your ears be in case, I Will give you a taste on it; his
argument was fet out of the Poem called, The lost sheep: and thus it is


Prithee be brief?


Nay peace, and it were in place where you might wake, the best men in the
parish, for commonly they sleep the beginning, because they love not
division: but to the lost Sheep. Beloud, you must imagine this Sheep was a
Sheep, a lost Sheep; a Sheep out a the way: but my dear flock and loving
Sheep, whom like a careful Shepherd, I have gathered together with the
whistle or pipe, as it were of mine eloquence, into this sold of peaceful
Community; Do not you stray do not you fly out, do not you wander, do not
you loose your selves; but like kind Sheep, and valiant Rams: I speak to you
the better part and head of my flock. As I say, you shall see the valiant
Rams turn all their horns together, and appose themselves against the
Woolfe, the hungry Woolfe, the gredie Woolfe, the Lams-deuowring Woolfe, the
Woolfe of all Woolfes, to defend their Eawes and young ones. Durst you say all
your heads together, and with the horns of your Manhood defend your
families, your own wives, and your neighbors children: Was not this stinging
geere


A good Sheepish admonition.


The fitter for my Audience: while you live, have a ear to fit your Audience.


Thou speak like a Christian: prithee what Religion art of?


How many souer I make use of, I Will answer with Piauano Orllotto the Italian:
I profess the Dukes only


What Is his reason for that?


A very sound reason: for says he, I came Raw into the world, and I would not
willingly go roasted out, so close up the stomach of your Discourse with that
dry answer, and euey man about his business


You Will be mindful of to morrow-night.


As your Lawyer of the Term, or your Landlord of the Quarter day.


Why so: the mettle I must forge my plot on, lies a warming in the furnace of
my brain; and I must fashion it Instantly, for fear it burst the heat. Give
my conceit way, for here comes one must help to proportion it


How now Demetrius, what wind has blown up this storm of melancholy, thy
countenance was not wont to be thus cloudie? Whence proceeds this sudden
alteration


From mine own hard fortune my Lord, that my ill-stard nativity should
continue thus opposite


Art crossed in a suit at Court? or what is the matter? speak.


I Will acquaint your Honor: I hope no other ear ouerheares us, Under Dianaes Oak
I found an inscription upon a stone, which told me, that wealth Aristomeres
sometimes brought into Archa lea, had there under hid a massy sum of
treasure


Under Dianaes Oak? Dorus shall have my daughter Mopsa: no more words on it, and
thou love me Dorus: smother thy golden hops a day or two; thou shall have
Mopsa, but I Will have all the Gold, then marie my daughter to some great man,
though he be poor, it is the fashion: I Will be Nobly allied what ere it cost me:
shall be my Son in law Dorus: have an eye to the Princess, fall close to my
daughter Mopsa

Court her and spare not: now begins the sport,
Kiss her, do kiss her; thou shall pay sweetly fort:
I can gull you, know what fair words can do,
I Am an old Knave, and a young Courtier too.

So, so; how violently he deuowers his bane, and steals himself into the
order of Gullerie: me thinks I see how betwixt hope and fear he sweates in
his practice, and like a foolish dreamer, castes how to lay out his wealth
before it comes in. So much for him: Now to my Lady Beauty his wife; and as
the Devil would ha're, here she comes


Dorus, how now Dorus' What time a day is it with you?


What time a day so'ert be with me, it is sleeping time with my Lord, I Am sure
of that


Sleeping time Dorus, what do thou mean by that?


Nay nothing: he is troubld with a kind of malady called Iusurectio carnis.


How, a dish of Creuices? nay and that be the worst, good enough: I am glad a
falls to Fish, for he was given to Flesh a late too too bad


Mass I thought as much, for I saw him go a angling.


I hold my Ladyship to some strumpet.


Life, a ielosie; I think you are a Witch, it was so indeed.


Nay I thought as much: he was wont to kiss me, and do all kindness a man
could do, till he came to the Court; and now he will not lie with me
forsooth: and why? it is the Court fashion. He will not love me, and why? it is
the Court fashion. I must not come near him at his down lying, nor his
vprising, ctc. And this be the Court fashion, would I were an honest woman of
the Country again, be Courtiers who list. I, I, Dorus, I tell thee in tears,
he has not done by me, as a Husband should do


It Is nothing to me, I cannot do withal Madam, would I could.


Yes marie may thou Dorus; thou may, and shall do withal too and thou will: but as thou look to enjoy my daughter Mopsa, acquaint me with the
old Foxes starting hole


That Is past my cunning: the old Fox has more holes then one, to hide's head
in: But not to go long about the bush with you


No good Dorus, I do not love a man should go long about my bush: What is she
for a woman


I know not what she is for a woman; marie I fear she is little better then a
Whore for your Husband: hark in your ear; she is Manasses wife


Manasses wife? marie fire Master gunner; a Putitane turned Puncke: Gods my
precious. I Will slit her nose, as I am a Lady will I: is she the party you wot
on


Yes faith Madam, she is the Mare the man rid on.


I Will spoil their sport, sadle my Mule there, have an eye to the princess:
shall ha my daughter and be but to spite him withal, faith Fox i will ha you out
of your hole, or i will fire you out


Nay that will do no good, but for your own good Madam, take heed you do not
scold


Why may not a Lady scold Dorus?


Scold, O in no case, twill mar a Ladies beauty clean, and make her look
as hard favored at any ordinary woman


Godamercie for that Dorus, I Will not loose my beauty for twenty on'em: saddle
my Mule, bring me my chopping knife, I Will gold the lecherous Goat, and mince his
Trull, as small as herbs to the pot. This is not scolding Dorus, is it


No this is tolerable.


Nay then I care not, saddle my Mule I say, let her pray God her feeling be
good, for as I am a Lady, I Will not leave her an ele to see withal, and yet I
will not scold neither


Oh take heed of that at any hand, So, so, so: now it begins to quicken me
thinks, I see already how she runs atilt at the Wenches eyes: calls the maid
Baud, the woman Whore, and her husband Lecher: and when all comes to all, like
an Irish Wolf, she barks at her own shadow; but committing her and her Ass
to their wildgoose chase: now to my sweet heart Mopsa, for she is all the blocks
last in my eye to slumble on: and God bless my wits, for the fool haunts me


Dorus, where is my Father Dorus?


Your Father, Oh my dear Mopsa?


Nay now you flout me?


Flout you? oh the fair heavens, but this it is for a man to cast away himself
in violence of passion and extremity of sighs on a piece of beauty, that
cares not for him, but it is the tricks on you all


Tricks, no as god mend me, and I should not have a husband till I got him
with tricks, I should lead apes in hell: but faith tell me, do thou love me
Dorus


Do I love you quoth ye, It cuts my very heart strings, do I love you? why
it is the only mark my Inqeuors she or at


If thou do not hit the mark, then you are a very bungler: but where is my
Father


Why I have sent him and your mother out of the way of purpose, and appointed
Manasses to meet us this evening at Adonis Chapel in the Amasons apparel, to
marry us: I think this are signs I love you


I but you jest, I doubt you will not marry me.


Will you mere me there?


As I am a Virgin I will.


And come with an intent to marry me?


As I hope to be a wife I will.


You must take heed you keep our purpose close,


As I did the loss of my Maydenhead.


Why have you lost it then?


Many a dear day ago, yet I told Nobody on it but my Mother and our
Horsekeeper, and they say I am nere the worse maid for that, and I can keep my
own counsel, as I hope I shall; but will you meet me soon


Just in the midway, as Tilters do.


I Will go before and stay, but do not deceive me, and you do, I Will show my
Fathers Horsekeeper all as God mend me


So tria sequntur tria, now am I rid of a triumuirie of fools,
and by there absence have won a free accesle to an escape.
If my Lisanders hope prove like to this,
This night shall Crown us Monarchers of our bl^^^e.

No more of these delays sweet Madam, your love has broken day often with my
expectance, I dare give it trust no longer


I confess it my Liege, and like a spent Dear, not able to maintain longer
flight, I cast my self down breathless at your loves mercy: yet I beseech
your Majesty, let not your eager desires, practice any present violence upon
my yielding chastity: it was only possession of my love you had in chase, which
with conuenent time and place purchased, I put your grace in full possession of


Although thy Breath be never but Musical, yet it never taught the string of
true happiness till now: and to approve thy heart sets hand to thy word, appoint
the time


Then this present evening (and yet my Virgin blood, and ashamd to consent to
the betraying of my modesty) meet me at Adonis bower, where i will make tender
of subdued chastetie to your high Majesty, as my first and most victoriuos
conqueror


By my Imperial Globe, and hope of those Joys, thy presence shall bring to
enrich me with, i will meet thee, and make thee Queen over the most submisse
Captive that ever love took prisoner


If you deceive me.


Not except warm life,
Deceive my voice of their innatiue heat.
Then have slow time, exchange thy leaden sleete,
For Hormes wings till I my fair hopes meet.
But locked once in the arms of my delight,
Cloth all the world in an eternal night.
And steed of morning when the Sun should rise,
They shall see two in my Zelmanes eyes.

So farewell thought I, I have prepared you a Zelmanes answerable to your
expectation
Then triumph in thy will, and let thy thoughts
Proclaim a lubilee: my teeming hope:
Are now delivered of a gracious birth,
Which I have Christened, opportunity.
Unto whose shrine in honor of this day,
My thoughts shall hold a monthly sacrifice,
Love grant Demetrius, meet the like success,
Our pains are crowned with double happiness.

Only our disguises hold firm, but all other attempts meet untimely deaths,
even in their cradles


What and we should acquaint the Ladies with our intents.


Twould argue a kind of cowardice in out wits, that ha such suspectles
admittance to there presence, as this disguise has purchased us, we should not
have that ability of inuenture to entangle'em in their own security


Well howsoever, we must not dwell long determining for the liberty of stay
with Dametas, who out of his covetous disposition in detaining our reward,
allowed us the eldest day of our licent abode at Court, is run out


It Is very true, and for my part, I Will rather go home with a private repulse,
then managing any unlikely attempt, become sufferer under a public disgrace


That's my very thought, yet that our second ariuall be not altogether empty of
imploiment, lets practice something upon Dametas, and acquaint the world with
his coward baseness; in which, he not only detracts from his masters bounty,
but look how as Conduit head or master-spring that is poisoned, does his best,
to enfect the whole body of the court, with the leprosy of his covetousness


There Is no action of his begetting can be said to be truly honorable.


How can they when there Father's a mungrell, the Duke out of his honorable
bounty commanded him to reward our travails with 200. Crowns: and now after
two months attendance, and enforst delays: In which time an ordenarie
petitioner might have spent the vasew of the reward, he packes us off with 50.
Crowns, his excuse being that his master has forgot us, and what he does, is
of his own bounty, as if the Moon should brag she gave the world light, when
all the luster she has, comes from the heat of the Sun


Should his villainies be suffered to prosper, they would grow to such height,
as the Dukes authority should ha much trouble to prune them


To prevent which, his majesty shall have private note of it, knew we in whose
trust to conduct it


It Is an Office very few dare undertake, he is so riueted to the Dukes good
opinion


Lies there no jar twixt none of the Nobility and him, what say you Zelmanes?


The gallant, Amason: you could not ha cast your choice fitter, for her
honorable mind maintains deadly feud against his bace proceedinges: and here
she comes, attended by Dametas servant, lets wait on opportunity


Lisander.


Demetrius.


Lisander and Demetrius, stand close, of my life we are come to the birth of
some notable knavery


How blows the winds of our hopes?


Fair to the point of our expectlicion, I have made away the Duke and the Dutch.


How made away them? poysond them.


with a confection of love, which I have so tempred with fair promices, as
their minds are in loves heaven already: Videlicet in Adonis bower, where this
evening I have given em my word to meet em; but I have so cast it, that
Manasses shall meet em in my steed


It Will be a rare scean of mirth, to hear what costly discourse the i will bestow
upon the fool in thy outside


Do you hear that.


yes, thank love and my ears, but list the conclusion.


I have cleard the way to Violetta, but what order have thou taken, with thy
burbolts: Dameta, Myso, and amorous Mopso


shot em away, at three several marks, yet so conveyed it that in the end they
shall all meet at Adonis chapel


This project cannot but bring forth some notable deceit.


My hopes should want of thyer will, and it do not.


Now we have made a smooth passage to our escape, how shall convey our lover
out of the Island


I have determined of that sir, and better to effect, my boy this time have
cast such a bait of knavery to the two Captains, Kalader and Philinax, as we
may pass without suspicion


But how for transportation.


I am furnished of that to, you remember the two Lacedemou intelligencers


Now what of us.


Hold my life, we shall be put in this scean of gullery.


Oh in any case.


For the love of Cupid do, iniquiris past, lets take our entrance, and pass
over the stage like mu^es, to furnish out a show


And see occasion like a kind wench presents em in the very instant my honest
friends welcome, have you not your dispatch with a letter to Lacedemon


Madam we have, and stay only to take our leaves of your Ladyship, and know
what service your honor will command


you have my thanks, for the truth is, I must commit business of much import
unto your trust, and to prevent much circumstances take my word, you are not
ignorant of the Kings general challenge


About his daughters.


you understand me, with these few crowns receive my mind which is to convey
the 2, ladies whom we in these disguises have won to Lacedemon


were we but confirmd of your of estates.


well give your sufficient assurance of that and the princesses themselves
shall confirm it


we crave no better madam, but shall we not ha yours honors company.


No: having brought them abord, we will make return to the Duke, to let him
understand we stole not our prizes but won them manfully at the point of wit


A noble resolution.


His foil will appear the more palpable, and your conquest the more
applausable, where shall we receive the Ladies


Be that our care, but on your lives be heedful of your safe ties.


More then of our own my lord,


Enough whilst you attend we will to the Duke, and play all guls or none.


All Guls indeed since you had follies whip,
No guls, to all guls, fools love fellowship.

Look well to mine Ass there, lord how I sweat with anger; this sames the
house sure, and now like a wise Lady let me count my hurts, and see how I shall
be reuengd: it shall be so, i will have em both carted, and manasses shall go before
like a whifler and make way with his horns, where be these whores: open the
door, where be these pan ders: O that I were not a lady: I could scold like a
butter-whore


whose there a gods name, lord for his mercy is the woman mad.


yes I thank ye fort: horn mad, where is your companion whetes the old
leacherous goat my husband, open the door I say


Jesus for thy mercy sake madam, what do I want.


what do I want, the chief implement a woman should have I want that as a woman
cannot be without, I mean my husband, I want


your husband, I saw him not as I am an honest woman.


not as you are an honest, so I think, but as you are an arrant whore you did,
you must have your Creuishes with a pox cannot City Maunchet and fresh
cod-serue your turn, but you must have Court cake-bread and Creuishes with a
vengeance, but come give me my husband, or i will have him out of the flesh on
thee, and yet I will not scold neither


Pray Madam ha patience: what should your husband do here


That which he should do at home with his wife, and he were worth his ears.


Lady I protest I do not know him,


Not know him thou lie in every vain ith heart thou lie, thou know him,
and as Adam knew Eve thou know him, he has been as inward with thee, as
ever he was with me, he has by his own confession he has, and thou deniest
it, thou lie in thy throat like a Puritanicall whore as thou art, O that I
were a butter-whore for an hour I might scold alittle


Madam they are no honest men that bring these tales to you


Men bring tales to me, I defy thee in thy guts, I defy thee, men bring tales
to me, thou take me to be one of thine own church do: they are no honest
men that bring tales to thee and ha wives of their own, and my husbands one of
them, go thy ways now


I beseech you madam do but hear me.


Hear thee, I have heard too much of thee, too too much too much, where is my
husband, bring forth my husband, i will teach him to put a difference betwixt Joan
and my lady I hold him ten pound ont, and yet I will not scold neither, and I
had bin an old hag past tea ming as his whore is a puritan, it had bid somewhat,
but being a woman of Gods making, and a lady of his own, and wearing mine own
hair which is much in a lady of my standing I can tell you, to use me thus,
flesh and blood cannot induer^, let me come in, open the door let me come in, O
that I were any vile thing in the world but a lady that I might scold a
little


So so, so, take your places, for the same bald pated oak is the stage, where
ye shall see the part of a doting fool performd by an old man and a young
wench

Do worshipful Dametas,
The same man,
Has he no fellow acters in his most lamentable, commical, historical,
tragical, musical, pastoriall

None that require any mouthing but his Ass and himself, marry then he has
Signer Mattocke, a very sharp sastyricall humotist, and Mounser le spade, but
he goes somewhat more bluntly to his business, yet heel serve for mutes, and
as good as the best to furnish out the stage


But dares Dorus being but Dametus servant so abuse his mad master thus
grosely


O Lord Sir, their ha ben serving men have done their Masters far greater
abuse, yet had their wives conceald it, their ears should never have bin
acquainted with it


Is that a fashion in request.


Altogether I Will assure you, but obedience Gentleman the sean begins.


Pray God it be good he stays so long,
Ridiculous enough, and good enough.

So, stand Ass, stand gentle Ass.


What countreimen is his Ass he speaks so familiarly to him.


Ath City breed, marry he picks up his living ath burs and nettles that grow
about the Court gate

So, by thy leave stone, by thy patience honest stone, the very gravel savors

Oh take heed of that master in any case.


Pure mettle, excellent gold: but let me see now, I shall by computation have
some three millions of them, I some three or four millions, how shall I employ
em to make the most profit of em


That would be known indeed.


I Will put out one million to use, after the rate af seven score to the hundredth:
and yet I wnot, no fie, for then you will ha my humor brought ath stage for a
vserer; to prevent with scandalous report, i will put it into my Scribe-maiors
hand, and he shall deal for me


There Is is a simple cloak to cover his villainy.


It Is a very short one,: and passing slite to hide his knauerie.


it cannot chose but be seen through,


An other Milion i will lay to bestow in Offices. I will have wealth or i will rake it
out ath kennels else, chimnies ha smoakt for already, and now i will deal upon
sea-cole and salt, now, now, now, it comes, sweet gold, honest Dorus, fortunate
Demetrius, divine gold, how, how, shall I adore thee, O let me do the homage of
my knees: now now, for the tongue of a Poet, tho I hate poetry worse then any
of the seven deadly sins, I could wish my self a Poet for some hour, to
write a Poem in the praise of my divine mistres; and see the very bed wherein
her divinity is lodged: happy, happy, thric


happy Dametas, now like an oreioid lover, let me open the sheets of my
heavenly mistress, with reverence, so with humble reverence, and like a
blushing lover that puts out the light ere he presumes to touch the bed of his
love so let me darken the candles of my body, mine eyes, and first bless my
hands with touching, next enrich mine ears with hearing, and lastly make
happy my eyes with with seeing, and let them convey the joy downinto the
bosom of my thoughts, by degrees, softly by degrees


Did you ever see Ass make such a ceremonious preparation


be not offended sweet mistress that I presume to touch.


a fools head of your own,


Has a bin at any cost of all this invoke for a coxcomb and a bell.


beshrow my judgment but he desetues it,


And his desert were near so much, he could but bear away the bell, and so you
say he does


A coxcombe and a bell, oh indignity: damnable ok^, vile and evil accuest Dorus,
unfortunate Dametas, Diana I tell thee thou art no honest gods to use a
Gentleman thus. What here a writing, your help good spectacles, lend me your
help good spectacles, some comfortable news good spectacles

Who has his hire has well his labors plast,
Earth thou did seek, and store of earth thou have.
He that vain hopes pursues for love of pelf,
Shall loose his wits and likely find himself,
Then think thy pains rewarded well,
Thou broughst the fool, bear back the bell:
Of other matters what ensues
Adonis bower shall tell the news,
Villainous poetry, I am made a flat fool by poetry,
But though I can do em no futther disgrace, my fatal curse,
a Wronged gentleman's fatal curse dwell ever upon them, Diana
Here me, and let my words find gracious acceptance.

Hide your heads, the terrible curse comes like a ston upon you


Rancor, spite, malice, hate, and all disasters,
Strengthen my faith against all portastors.
May their intents tho pure as crystal glasses,
Be counted falts and capital trespasses,
O may their lives and labourd industry,
Though worthy of Apolloes plaud it be
The cleerest thought in loyalty excelling
Be by some Dor presented for libelling,
when they have writ a seeine in which their brains,
Have dropped there dearest sweets, and their swollen veins,
Emptied their Cundits of their purest spirit,
As they stand gaping to receive their merit,
In sted of plaudities their chiefest blisses
Let their deserts be crowned with mewes and hisses:
Behind each post and at the gallery corners,
Sit empty guls, slight fools and false informers,
Let some slye Fox out of discreations embers,
Term them the lands unnecessary members,
And like the dear when they have spent their breath,
to make kings sport let them betorne to death,
Even by their friends, twold set my thoughts a twanging
Might I but see one of them go to hanging.

A passing strange curse and no question he has traueld far for some of the
rimes


He must travail further that finds any reason int,


No matter for reason theirs rhyme enough and that be good.


Some: of it is no better then it should be, or my judgment deceiues me.


Sure he had some reason to make this rhyme, and a man could pick it out,


rather then i will be counted inquisitiue, mine ears shall content themselves
with the rimes only, and leave the reason to the scanning of poets whom it
more nearly concerns


But where is the wag that invited us to this banquet of mirth shrunk in the
wetting


tware a rare jest now if whilst the boy kept us here in expectation of
Dametas gullery his M: had made an escape with the duks daughters


that or some knavery else upon my life, I had the boy in shroud suspision at
the first


And this his sudden and stolen departure, confirms it current


then we are sped, for in suspisions face,

I see some subtle stratagem in chase.

Will your lordship believe me now: nay and I sait your worship may swert, tho
I have but a (poor as to say) hole of mine own I hope the spirits have more
denomination over me, then to make it a common slaughter house of carnallity
where every jack may command flesh for his money


No more words sweet woman I confess I was in the wrong, there is not the
hole the Fox hides his head in: and therefore for the love of womanhood
conceal mine errors, for howsoever I complaind it is thy forhed aks, thy temples
ha the terrible blow as the say, thy husband is a bad man


my husband:


I, I, good woman thy husband: he is as I say a fleshly member and I fear he
has overcome the foolish thing my daughter


your daughter i will slit her nose by this light and she were ten ladies, it was not
for nothing my husband said he should meet her this enening at Adonis chapel,
but and I come to the godspeed ont, i will tell em ont soundly


I do good woman tell em ont, and spare not but in any case do not scold.


Why may not a gentlewoman scold in a good case:


I know not what a gentlewoman do in a good case, but a lady must not in any
case


tho I may not scold I may tell em roundly ont I hope,


that may you do law,


and i will not be mealely mouthd I warrant em, will you bear me company to the
chapel maddam


withal my heart mistress, what Dorus has given me, i will give my friend, no
fool to company


Farewell bright sun thou lightner of all eyes
thou falst to give a brighter beam to rise.
Each tree and shrub were tramels of thy hair,
But these are wier, for none but kings to wear,
And my rude tongue striving to blaze her forth,
Like a bad art seman does disgrace her worth,
but heeres the place, upon this crystal stream:
Where Citherea did vnyoake her teame
Of silver doves, to interchange a kiss
With young Adones shall I meet my bliss:
The gentle minits crowned with crystal flowers,
Loosing there youths, are grown up perfect hours,
To hasten my delight, the bashful moon
that since her dalliance with Endimior,
Durst never walk by day is under sail,
In steed of sheets has spread her silver veil,
Each gliding brook and every bushy tree
Being tipped with silver were her livery,
And the dim night to grace our amorous wars,
Has stuck nine spheres full of immortal stars,
Insted of pearls the way on which she treads
Is strawd with Crystal deu and silver beads.
She comes, her feet makes music with the ground,
And the chaste air is ravished with the sound,
My soul flies forth to meet her: hell my wife,
Her presence like a murderer drives the life
Out of my pleasure breast, her ielous cie
Enuyes the heaven of my felicity.
Zelmane, or my husband life or hate.


What makes old Autum out a bed so late,
that snow should go a woeing to the sun
When one ^arme kiss works her confusion.

I have the jest, suspicion that keeps
Court in my husbands thoughts, seeing my love,
Elect this walk, has brought him after him.

She dogs her fure, and she to shake her off Has taine some other walk I Will
place mine ear in distance of her will


Could I but hear the innocent delivery of his breath, twold be a second
iubile of mirth


Here comes my love.


your love? Alas poor Duke,
Your forward hopes will meet a barren spring,
My sun appears.

Fie your love speaks to loud,
Your suns eclipst, your date upon a cloud.

See how his arms like precious phoenix wings,
Spread to embrace me.

Now the Cucko sings,
Those amorous arms do make a golden space
To hug a Duke.

But i will fill up the place.


Those fingers tipped with curious porphery,
Staining Pigmalions matchless imagery,
Like amorous twins all of one mother nursed,
Contend in courtesy who should touch me first.

should touch me first: their strife is undertook,
To twine a young bay not a far stooping oak.

Young bay, stale lest, that a dry saplesse rind
should hold young thoughts, and a licentious mind,
Were he but gone now.

Were the Duke away,
My hope, had got the better of the day.

This is Adonis chapel, I wonder they come not, tho I bear a little learning
about me, and a few good clothes, I would not wisham to make Balams ass a me:
for though many fools take no felicity but in wearing good clothes (tho they
be none of their own) I have a further reach in me


I could ban my stars.


I curse my fate.


That cross me thus.


Make me unfortunate.


Alas good lady, how her pretty feet labor to find me.


that my hopes should meet such black events.


O would the trindly night darken her self.


Would the Moon lose her light,
That in the bosom of some foggy cloud
I might embrace my love.

But night is purblind
To make a Duke a slave.

To make a Duchess
wrestle with amorous passions.

life a spleen
Could my rough breath like a tempestious wind,
Blow out heavens candles, leave the world stark blind,
That it might either have no eyes to see:
Or use those eyes it has to pleasure me.

Or use those eyes it has to pleasure me.


Who would ha thought the cold had been so good a musition: how it plays
upon my chappes, and makes my teeth skippe up and down my mouth like a
company of virginal Iackes, but I find small music in it, and Mopsa should
come now I could do her little good, yet and she were here, she and I would
have about at cob-nut or at cheri-pit or somewhat to keep our selves from
idleness, tho she be but a fool, the bables good enough to make sport with all

But chose him, since he has buld me with an vrchin, i will go fetch Raph our
horskeeper, let him that got the calfe keep the cow in a knaves name and he
will, ha you your book here


no matter wench, I can dote well enough without book,


Nay and ye can dote well enough your self, I care for neither of them both,
but indeed I love to have a thing well done, for says my mother, a thing once
well done, is twice done, and I am in her mind for that up and down


Whose with my Lord the Duke, it cannot be,
Mine eye would not conceal such treachery.

It Is not the Duchess sure, no it is amarous Jove,
that seeing Zelmane passionate for love,
Descends to comfort her, Jove if there be
A powerful Phoebus God of poetry,
In dear remembrance of fair Daphnes rape,
to win my love, lend me some stranger shape,
Such as your selves have worn, that when your fame
is sung by poets, they may cote my name,

Sure it is my daughter,


Daughter: how her eye
Cuts out new forms, new shapes of jealousy:

As sure as death it is she, for see they stand
like amarous twins, intwisted hand in hand,
Breast against breast, and that no joy be missing,
To hear discourse, their lips keep time with kissing,
I Will not indurst impatience grow strong,
And tho a prince, tell him he does thee wrong.

Do preethe do, this sweetens all the rest,
But here would be the elixar of the jest,
if whilst we kept each other at a baie,
A third should come, and bear the hare away.

Pox a Hippolita, I am a dumb woman and you can tell me news of Dorus


I had rather see ten doruses hanged then lose Hippolita,


I had rather see ten fathers damd then lose my sweet dorus,


I shall run mad and I find not Hippolita.


I shall run frantic and I find not Dorus.


What Is here, I shall run mad for Hipolita.


And I shall run frantic and I find not Dorus, I hold my life we have some
comedy in hand, we shall have a full scene, for here comes more actors


Assures I am a sinner to God madam, that sames he.


What with a brace of wenches, I faith old brocke, have I taken you in the

their husbands at home for you: it is not for nothing now I see, that the Duchess

Madam,


i will mad you with a vengeance.


Touch not the prince.


On your alleagance forbear, what means this outrage, cannot our private walks

how fares the prince.


How cheares my good Zelmane?


Zelmane, no Gods my judge my liege, I am Manasses, miserable Manasses, your
husbands scribe-ma^or madam


Manasses.


A fool.


My man.


And my dear head, alas sweet love, what make thou here.


Mary work for the hangman, and the Duke be not the more merciful.


There Is some deceit in this, Dametas, where is Hippolita?


I, I, there is some knavery in this: Mopso where is Hippolita?


doubtless there is some villainy in this, Mepso whers Hipolita?


There Is no plain dealing in this, Manasses where is Dorus?


Answer directly, where is Hippolita?


Alas madam I know not, whilst I almost melted my self with digging of gold

And whilst I ran to Manasses, thinking to take my husband and his wife in the

Who sent you to Diannes oak to dig gold?


who sent you to take your husband in Manasses house?

who sent you to Adonis chapel.


dorus:


And who turned you into this shape:


They that I fear have made guls of us all, Zelmane, and dorus:


we are all simply gulde, and see where the Sun scarce halfeready, skippes
from his Eastern bed, smiling at our gullery


Come where is this lusty wit-maister.


the keeper of this loue-lottery,


This gallant luventus of fourscore, that like my Lady of the Lake, displaies
against al comers


May a couple of plain witted princes have a sight of your prizes:


Where be these Ladies ha? ha your wits had such a skirmishing that the two
maids have lost their heads in the conflict


Heads, I and bodies to my Lord, and all at one shot, and which is worse our
wits are so scatered with the terible blow that to be plain we are scarce our
own men again


then you have had some knock^ng,


so it appears by the story my Lord:


How say y^u my lady, what Oule sings out of that Iuy bush


was your (...) knighted in this last action:


I am (...)ch a fool, I love my lord, I am no knight, I am Manasses, they made
a plain fool


the only were, for the gaurded fool is out of request: but faith my liege
how did your opposites behave themselves, did they win the Wenches fair at the
point


At the very push of invention, and went off clear untouched,


And could you draw no blood of their wits:


Not a drop.


Nor demetrius neither, nor Manasses?


Neither, to our own disgrace be it spoken, the carriage of their stratagem
deserves applause, and I held it a credit to rest captive to such valiant
conquerors


Why so be, I like a man that will confess his error.


It merrits comisseration madam and my liege, not to detract from our worth:
your ear, we two are the parties you wot on


Ware you the men?


No he was the man, mary I was the woman in the moon, that made you walk all this last night like the man in the mist, I could say somewhat to you to Madam
as for demetrius and his man let them stand like fools as they are


Can it be possible.


No, no, we are guls, Innocent sots, but lante tanta, the girls are ours we
have won em away to dargison


Come we have won the conquest, and that's sufficient.


You are a manasses it is not sufficient: aha not Hercules for iole, Jove, for
Danue, Apollo for daphene, pan for Si^ne, nay the whole pack of their piperly
godheads could a dischargd a stratagem with more spirit of al merit, an ambling
nag and a down a down we have borne her away to dargison


It Was the most rarest, diuinest, Metaphisicalst, piece of invention, that, what
say you my liege


I give your deserts their full merit you have gotten equality


All the wenches gave you:


Alas what spirits under the moon could have detainder but know that her
cherry red lip, a down, a down


Trust me but you have deserved high commendation.


Your merit stood of the upper staire of admiration.


Why thou have a pretty relish of wit, now that can see the broad ey of my
desert at a little hole of demonstration


your desert save me free, you have done a most (to use your own phrase)
Metaphysicall piece of service, but you had some help int questionles


I do not think but the ladies had some hand int:


A finger, I confess a finger by the hope of perseverance, a very little finger.


I thought as much by the making of the jest.


I cannot detract from the ladies worth, for I knowem for excellent work women,


work women fit to make tailors men.


I by my faith do I, nay your best tailors are arrant botchers to em, you shall
have a lady make an end of a suit, a court suit, especially when all the
tailors in a country know not how to set a stich int


Some ordinary suit perhaps.


your best court suits that are, are finished by ladies, I have known a suit my
self lien a making and maring 3, 4, and five year together and then a lady
has despacht it in a month with a wet finger, such a finger might the ladies
have in your plot


never wet a finger by this sun.


Then she helped you with one dry jest or other, but and we may be so bold:
faith where are the ladies


sure enogh I warrant you, some fools now would have kept em hear and have
been guld on em again, and laughed at age, but to prevent all danger, we have
shipped em home for Lacedemon


to Lacedemon, your sun of wit shines but dimly in that methinkes, to whose
charge have you trusted em


to them we durst, nay you must think we are no fools,


Fools: nay deep wit, and policy forbid.


We had no sooner their surprisall, but we had disguise ready, a ship ready, a
couple of lusty friends ready, the Lacedemons intelligencers


durst you trust such precious jewels in such rusty caskets:


durst, our health, our lives: why they were my tenants, nay you must think we
sifted them, we are no fools in that neither


If in any thing your wits deserve the babble it is in that,


none but fools would have committed such inestimable peers to a couple of
strangers


And in a ship to,


And under sail to.


And unfurnished of friends to.


And without shipping to follow em to.


you were no fools in any thing but that, and in that not to flatter, you
express the true shape of folly and merely merit the name of fools


What will you say now when these fellows surrender us our loves?


We Will discharge you and set their names down for gulls in your stead.


you know the proverb when the sky falls we shall have larks.


And when you can bring proof that we are cosend of our Wenches we will be the
woodcocks


Why then we have once springed a couple of woodcockes.


Do you know these? Who are the fools now?


Violletta.


My Hippolita:


What a strange change is here:


yes faith gallants you have very strange carding and you knew al, but I hope
you will offer up your cards and yield the set lost


Guls:


And abusd i will loose my life before I loose my honor,


Honor, and life before i will loose my love:


Nay gentlemen we bar all violence, the liberty of our challenge was to all
alike equally free, and since these by fair play have won em, it stands with
our honor to see them peaceably possessed of em, then surely take em, for though
you wear the breeches give us leave to stand a little


why father is it not time that we were sped
It Is a great charge to keep a maidenhead,
Loose it we must and to prevent il course,
Better to giuet then have it stolen perforce,
if you be pleased let envy do her worst
Spit out her poison or containt and burst?
Welcome to all, to all a kind god night,
They trewly live, that live in scorn of spite.

In B. the last page, for Lord, read love cannot be saved.
