CHronos, Chronos, mend thy Pace,
An hundred times the rolling Sun
Around the Radiant Belt has run
In his revolving Race.
Behold, behold, the Goal in sight,
Spread thy Fans, and wing thy flight,

Weary, weary of my weight,
Let me, let me drop my Freight,
And leave the World behind.
I could not bear
Another Year
The Load of Human-kind.

Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! well have thou done,
To lay down thy Pack,
And lighten thy Back,
The World was a Fool, ever since it begun,
And since neither Ianus, nor Chronus, nor I,
Can hinder the Crimes,
Or mend the Bad Times,
It Is better to Laugh than to Cry.

It Is better to Laugh than to Cry.

Since Momus comes to laugh below,
Old Time begin the Show,
That he may see, in every Scene,
What Changes in this Age have been,

Then Goddess of the Silver Bow begin.

With Horns and with Hounds I waken the Day.
And hye to my Woodland walks away;
I tuck up my Robe, and am buskined soon,
And tie to my Forehead a wexing Moon.
I course the fleet Stagg, unkennel the Fox,
An chase the wild Goats over summets of Rocks,
With shouting and hooting we pierce through the Sky;
And Echo turns Hunter, and doubles the Cry.

With shouting and hooting, we pierce through the Sky,
And Echo turns Hunter, and doubles the Cry.

Then our Age was in it is Prime,

Free from Rage.

-- And free from Crime.

A very Merry, Dancing, Drinking,
Laughing, Quaffing, and unthinking Time.

Then our Age was in it is Prime,
Free from Rage, and free from Crime,
A very Merry, Dancing, Drinking,
Laughing, Quaffing, and unthinking Time.

Inspire the Vocal Brass, Inspire;
The World is past its Infant Age:
Arms and Honor,
Arms and Honor,
Set the Martial Mind on Fire,
And kindle Manly Rage.
Mars has looked the Sky to Red;
And Peace, the Lazy Good, is fled.
Plenty, Peace, and Pleasure fly;
The Sprightly Green
In Woodland-Walks, no more is seen;
The Sprightly Green, has drunk the Tyrian Dye.

Plenty, Peace, etc.

Sound the Trumpet, Beat the Drum,
Through all the World around;
Sound a Reveille, Sound, Sound,
The Warrior God is come.

Sound the Trumpet, etc.

Thy Sword within the Scabbard keep,
And let Mankind agree;
Better the World were fast asleep,
Than kept awake by Thee.
The Fools are only thinner,
With all our Cost and Care;
But neither side a winner,
For Things are as they were.

The Fools are only, etc.

Calms appear, when Storms are past;
Love will have his Hour at last:
Nature is my kindly Care;
Mars destroys, and I repair;
Take me, take me, while you may,
Venus comes not every Day.

Take her, take her, etc.

The World was then so light,
I scarcely felt the Weight;
Joy ruled the Day, and Love the Night.
But since the Queen of Pleasure left the Ground,
I faint, I lag,
And feebly drag
The ponderous Orb around.

All, all, of a piece throughout;


Thy Wars brought nothing about;

Thy Lovers were all untrue.

It Is well an Old Age is out,

And time to begin a New.

All, all, of a piece throughout;
Thy Chase had a Beast in View;
Thy Wars brought nothing about;
Thy Lovers were all untrue.
It Is well an Old Age is out,
And time to begin a New.
