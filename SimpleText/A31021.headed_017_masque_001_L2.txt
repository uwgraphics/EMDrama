When gaudy Flora in her prime
Observing it was Summertime
With fragrant flowers of each day
Had made our mother Tellus gay,
The newborn plumed minstrills fills
The si^iling heaven and ecchoing hills,
With chirping music, every groan
Was made their quire. -- Olympic Jove
Commanded Aprels balmy shoures,
To refresh the March bred flowers,
And May perfection in each field
To Aprels suckling babes to yield.
The spring p^^^umed this brood, whose sm^
The Phoenix nest might paral^ll.
Now did approach the festival
Of god Silvanus nuptial
To his grove haunting Clarida,
Then all the Faun^s keept holyday.
The nimble faries danced, and all
The dieties agresticall.
Cl^ius and kind Phisipile
Vowed loving Man and wife to be.
So Clodin did to Colatine,
So Serin to his Eglatine,
So Cloris did to Coridon,
And so dealt sheapheards many a one.
At length imploring love to be
So propitious unto me,
To Mira the fair sheapheardesse
In courteous wise, I did address
My hand, my heart, my cap, my coin,
With all the good I could conjoyne,
But she coy thing, refused to prove
What gentle Hymen is, or love.
As pevish Daphne fled away
From the illustrator of the day;
Even so my sight coy Mira flies,
My sighs she slights, my suit denies.
When glorious Sol has turned his back,
And all the world is hung with black.
Sleep (natures soft-nurse) flies my eyes,
My mind's ore-cast as are the skies.
(...) I Would rather fill a barn full then a bed;
More profit it is to have a crooked plough
Still going, then a tottering cradle rock.
But more then that, these I term foolish men,
(But foolish is the Amorists ep^hite,
Ou peut a peine aymer ensemble estre sage,
One scarce can be both wife, and love, together)
That ere will trust their honor in a Bark,
Made of so ^^ight weak bulrush as woman,
Apt every fleeting minute for to sincke it.
And how can^ thou expect fidelity,
In the disloyal sex called feminine.
Remember fifty sisters, Belus daughters,
Who all (save one) made of their husbands slaughters.
And both the Atrides had their envied lives
Endangered by the falsehood of their wives.
Euriphile (false Hag) her husband sold
To Polinyces for a chain of gould.
And Queen Euridice conspired
How to deliver to grim visag'd death
Her re^all Lord, and husband, to enthrone
In his void room her fancied Son in Law.
The fierce Medea did delacerate
Absyrtus tender members, to escape
Her Fathers pursuit, if we may rely
On the report of sage Antiquity.
Thou pleadst against thy self, I Will turn the point
Of thy last daggar into thine own breast.
Thou say Medea tore in twain her brother
Absyrtus, it is confessed, 't^as to discover
Her ardent, and firm settled desire
To follow Jason, ungrateful Jason,
Who after that, left her and all her charms,
To clap another Lady in his arms.
So have I seen a Horse-leach often embrace,
Cleave to and hang upon some bloud-swoln face,
Till its own turn be served, it holds fast,
Until his panch be full, then drop at last.
But to our ta^ke. Penelope lived chaste,
Though twice five years her royal Lord was gone.
Did not Aeneas fly, and leave his sword
To let out over-credulous Dido's blood.
When as Hiero blamed his wife, 'cause she,
Never informed him of his stinking breath.
I thought (quoth she) that all men's breaths smelt so.
Arria when Petus was condemned to dye,
First stabbed her self, then giving him the steel,
This wound (dear Petus grieves me not quoth she)
But that which thou must give thy self grieves me.
The Minians wives having obtained leave,
To say valete to their dying Lords,
Exchanged their habits, and exposed themselves
(In their escaped Spouses rooms) unto
The penalty of the offended Law.
Dona the partner of her husbands woe,
With him a long way (as his Page) did go.
When Conrad gave the Matrons leave to bear,
From Weinsberg foe-girt town what best they liked,
Each took up her own husband on her back.
Cornelia Annia did prostrate lie,
On her defunct Lords Sepulcher, and dye;
For this cause annually a pair of Doves
Are sacrificed to their firm settled loves.
And happy Phillacides loyal wife,
From death redeem^d him with the loss of life.
But many uncertain ways has Phillis gone.
To find her runnagate Demop^oon.

Humanum est errare, I confess,
Both sexes then are faulty; but what else
Do thy deluded eyes discover in
Thy Mira, that thy heart should fancy her.
Is It for her skin-deep beauty (her chiefest pride)
That Is but times fading flower, which as it is
Most delicate, is as volatious.
Its like unto the Colors Phidias drew,
Which seemed most admirable to the view,
But suddenly did vanish and impair,
At the weak puff of each aeriall breath.
A wife is but a fair affliction.
Symonides reputed her to be,
The Shipwreck of a man, the tempest of
A house, the troubler of quiet rest.
A prison of life, a plague assiduall,
A sumptuous conflict, a necessary evil,
A horrible care, an ordinary battle,
A sayly hinderance, the humane slavery,
A fair Aspe, an inevitable pain,
A pleasant damage, a domestic strife.
If then coy Mira scorn with thee to dwell,
On earth leave her to lead bruit Apes in hell.

Quote not these Accherontick Anchorites.
Those stollid moatheaten Foolosophers,
That libell against Angels, those night-birds
That do defile even their own nests, nay worse,
That strangle sacrilegiously the fames
Of their own mothers; Those ungracious brats
That impiously requite with Stygian Ink
The Nectar which indugently they lent them.
Heed not the hissing of that viperous brood
Of Parricides to their own mothers names.
A female is the second part of man,
She is a male in the the newest edition,
A wife's the best of her Lords movable.
For such a one fierce Champions have proved tame,
The stoutest Soldiers trembled, and look wan,
Ready to give their ghost up at a frown,
The oracles of wit and Philosophy,
Have been loves fools, and bent their litterature,
But to express great loves Supremacy,
And the extent of its Dominions.
Nay under Venus sacred Ensigns march,
Etheriall troops of high mounted gods.

Well, each man as he likes, but should the mad
Disloyal Sycophant, whose sphere is woe,
Attempt to shoot a raving shaft at me,
In's many pieces I would make it recoile
Upon his corpse, as there be golden sands,
In the Pactolian or Tagean shores.

Cease, cease, good Hegio, to repine at love,
Atlantas pace was staid by golden balls.
And gods themselves are often ensnared by love,
For they have slipped beyond their skill in that,
They have made beauty of a greater force
Then they themselves are able to resist.
For Laeda, Jove became a wandering Swan,
And for Europia a loud lowing Bull,
And for Antiopa a Satyr rude,
And for bright Danae a storm of Ore.
Did not Apollo leave his burnish't throne,
Lay by his tresses? and in humane shape,
Most humbly beg a boon at beauties gate?
Did not Alcides for Jole's sake
With huge often draw the slender thread.
He was taken captive by his captives look,
She took the Conqueror that had her took.
Kind Paris for to steal his dainty piece,
Traveled as far as betwixt Troy and Greece.
And Perseus amongst the Negroes sought,
And fair Andromade from Inde brought.
Cupid can make the Regal Lion sport,
In amorous dalliance with the frisking Kid.
Venus can yoke the ravenous and fell kite,
With milder Swans in the same Chariot;
Immane rapacious Eagles she can linck
And timorous silver-brested Doves together.
When she commands all animalls lay by
Their contrarieties, and antipathy.

Enjoy, sir, your conceit, but for my part,
I am invulnerable, thou blind Boy
Shall never take me captive, I am like
Achilles dipped in Styx, nor do I fear
Thy boy-ships shafts, go play with angry Bees
And painted Butterflies, and at the Wasps nest,
And when thou art stung, in thy mams lap go rest.

Hark Cupid and revenge, this profane Swain
Does slight thy quiver, and blaspheme thy bow,
He says he is shot-proofe, scorns thy archery,
Scoffos at thy skill.
I Will penetrate his heart,
I Will make him be an earnest Votary
Unto a marble-hearted female Saint.
I Will melt to amorous thoughts his soul of stone,
I Will torture 'm in loves torrid, frigid Zone.
I Will make him in the same flames freez, and fry,
The world shall be enamored of his woe,
I Will find a Shepherdess in whom he will joy,
And this his darling I will soon infect
With coyness and with niceness, for her sake.
His morning Orisons shall nothing be
But numbers of innumerable sighs,
Which he shall count by pearly tears, not beads.
I Will make the cherries of her ruby lips
The only cordials for to sustain
His loathed life, and those shall be like to
Fugacia poma, which like Tantalus
He always shall desire, and always miss.
I Will make him view the place where she has set,
And thither he shall repair, as if he thought,
The place some sovereign virtue did contain
To ease him, and to cure his gnawing pain.

Let him not wander far from home to seek
Deep streams in which to wash his frisking flocks.
Let such uncessant floods flow from his eyes
As may supply the want of rivolets,
Let his pined cheeks and hollow countenance,
Affight all wolves from his secure sheep,
Let him spend all his days in pinching grief,
And melancholy discontents; and look
Like to a withered tree o're-growne with dross.
Let his illetable and pensive sighs,
Scare all rapacious, and omenous Ravens
From picking out the eyes of his young Lambs
Bleating for nutriment unto their dammes.

Innumerable such effects as these,
Shall all be caused by this keen pointed dart.
When as the long-tongu'd Lord of envious light,
Whose presence make the day, whose absence night.
Betrayed my mother, and the god of war.
Unto the sooty, black, club-footed dolt,
As he was tempering of a thunderbolt,
For to revenge this wrong, I made him prove,
The power of my golden shaft and love.
And I will make this Hegio soon confess,
I am a god, and of the starry race.
Now lay thy hatred down, thy spite decline,
And prove a votarie at Daris shrine.

BUt sure I was not borne Minerva-like?
Nor did fond Paracelsus teach my Sire
To make a man without conjunction,
What furious madness did possess my breast
To flout at love? and wrong the femal sex?
And to requite in a sharp Satyrs strain,
The roundelayes, and charming lullabies,
That my indulgent genetrix did warble?
What are my brains grown dry, or my blood cold?
Or am I on a sudden waxen old?
I thought, though Cupids aire-deviding shaft,
Soon penetrated the well tempered
Corslet: which the hot-halting god of fire,
Made for his boisterous rival, it should not find,
Or make a way to vulnerate my mind.
And therefore Venus I blaspem'd thy son,
But now I sing a Palinodia.
Alas I have heheld that lovely face
That from her eyes shot Cupids into mine.
To Abuse my sight, and work upon my frailty,
With their smooth oratory to undo me,
Among thy other trophies let me be,
Kind Cupid, Hertan Porrigo to thee.
Me thinks soft love has lately made a breach
Into the battered bulworks of my breast,
And there commands all my yielding powers,
Which now insulteth in their vassalage.
One look has struck my soul into a fever,
Me thinks affection whispereth in my care
Fair Daris name, Daris the shepherdess;
An object beautified with the choice gifts
Of liberal nature, and of virtue too,
My wandering eye has made my heart receive
So good opinon of the forenam'd Nymph,
And hourly it solliciteth my tongue,
To try my fortune, and to let it know,
Whether its like in Daris love to rest
In happy bliss, and blissful happiness;
Which if denied, its suddenly prepared,
To leave my skelliton unto grim death.
But courage Hegio, let not cold despair
Chill thy green, and wide-gaping wounds too fast;
She is a woman, and she may be won,
Venus Adonis loved, why may not she
Prove lovesick too, and at length fancy me:
Shall I be bashful then, and so expire
With grief; fie, fie, what shall a woman's eye
Prevail so far over me to cause me dye,
And leave my name in the fools Callender,
And there be noted with a rubie letter,
For a supereminent Festival;
No, I am loath to leave earth yet, I Will try
If I may live, and find a remedy.

BRight Phoebus who with morning light
Put'st Hesperus twinkling train to flight,
When as thou rowzest, and display
Thy golden locks, and summon day;
Thou who do rest thy drowzie-head,
In aged Thetis froathy bed:
When as thy gilded Car of day,
His glowingaxle does allay.
Thou who in twice 6 Months fulfill
Thy journall on th'Olympian hill,
Illustrious Lord of light, in vain
Thou bragg'st with arrows to have slain
Thy Python stern, whose massy bones
Were Iron bars, like congealed stones
His knotty sinews were, the boughs
Wer's shady covers; his great troughes
Deep Rivolets, which he (well nigh)
Caroused at one watering dry:
His belching shot forth flames, his eye
Shined like the dapled morning sky.
Fair Venus thy young hoodwinkt son
More glorious trophies often have won,
Thou that crown'st thy loves with bays,
Inventer of mellodious Lays.
Thou left'st Pernassus bifork't hill,
And Tempe thy fair domicill,
At loves command, and all to be
At Daphne's shrine a Votary.
Thou that did by virtuall heat
The happy plants, and herbs create,
Could find no plant, or herb to be
A medicine for loves malady.
When thou commandst the birds to bring,
In triumph to the world, the Spring,
The new-clad earth has quickly lost
Her Snow-white roabes, no chilly frost
Candies the grass, no ycie cream
Congeale the lake, or pearly stream;
No snow lies sheltred in the shade,
The earth is thawed and tender made:
For all thy heat, thy love does lowre,
Nor had thy scalding rays the power
To thaw her Marble ice, and this
It Was caused her Metamorphosis.
Large limbed Hercules trebly blessed
With fame, thou who in youth expressed
Deeds of honor, thy cradle's crowned
With brave achivements, which renowned
Thy name; thy valor was supplied
With strength, thy haughty spirit defied
An host of men, Heaven never conjoined
So strong a body, or so stout a mind.
Brag not cause you flew and withstood
Within the thick Naemaean wood
A beast, the temper of whose heart
Was like a nether Millstone; Dart,
Nor threatening Sword, nor frightfull Spear,
Could terrify it with Panick fear:
Like knotty wreaths of craggy brass
His sinews were, a noise did pass
From's mouth, which might strike deaf the cares
Of mortals, and affright the Spheres,
You wore his ruggid shaggie hide
About your shoulder, and left side.
The Hydra by thy hand was slain,
Whose heads lopt off sprouted again.
The mud was made his downie bed.
The stones were pillowes for his head,
His speckled jaws which hideous were,
Thy brawny arms did bodly tear.
Thy club made th'Erymanthean Bear.
Lie weltring in his ruddy goare,
His sharpened tusks shall spoil no more
(As it was wont to do before)
Arcadia, which in antique days
Did warble out her well-tun^d Lays,
And sing loves on her oaten reed,
Whilst her secure flocks did feed.
The Centaure thou subdu'st by force,
Half like a man, half like a horse.
Swifter then wind you ran, or thought,
On foot a running Stag you caught.
Rapacious bird Stymphalide,
Were made a prey to death by thee.
Thou mighty Scavinger wertable
To cleanse the foul Augean stable,
You made a Bull to cross the Maine,
And graze on Neptunes liquid plain.
And Diomedes fell monster,
Who made his captives provender
To his proud pampered steeds, by thy
Revengefull hand did justly dye.
False Cacus thou did crush to death,
And 'twixt thy arms squeeze out his breath:
Cease the adjuring world to tell
Of thy forced entrance into Hell.
You swadled Charon with his oar,
The triple-headed ban-dog roar,
And yelle: you Pluto ere you're gone
Confronted on his jeaty throne.
Hesperides fruit, sweet and gay,
By thee were stolen, and borne away.
By Juno's labors you war'nt broke,
And yet you yielded to loves yoke.
Thus Love made Hegio to epsy
Sweet Daris Phisiognomy,
And prove close prisoner to that eye,
Whose frowns make him prepared to dye,
Love wound her too, that we may all
Keep holyday at their Nuptial.
