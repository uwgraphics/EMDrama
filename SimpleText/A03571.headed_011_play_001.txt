NOw stand ye forth my merry men all
and hark what I shall say,
Of an adventure I shall you tell
the which befell this other day.
As I went by the high way
with a stout Friar I met.
And a quarter staff in his hand,
lightly to me he leapt
And still he bad me stand.
there were stripes two or three,
But I cannot tell who had the worse
but well I wot the whoreson
Leapt within me
and fro me took my pursse.
Is there any of my merry men all
that to the Friar will go,
And bring him to me forth withal
whether he will or no.

Yes Master I make God auow
to that Friar will I go,
And bring him to you
whither he will or no,

Deus hic, Deus hic, God be here
is not this a holy word of a Friar,
God save all this company,
But am not I a jolly Friar
For I can shoot both far and near.
and handly the sword and buckler
and this quarter staff also
If I meet with a gentle man or yeman,
I am not afraid to look him upon
nor boldly with him to carp^,
If he speak any words to me,
He shall have stripes two or three
that shall make his body smart.
But masters to show you the matter
wherefore and why I am come hither
in faith I will not spare,
I am come to seek a good yeoman
in Bernisdale men say is his habitation
His name is Robin hood
And if he be better man then I
his servant will I be and serve him truly
But if that I be a better man then he
by my truth my knave shall he be
and lead these dogs all three.

Yield thee Friar in thy long cote my throat,


I beshrew thy heart Knave thou hurtest


I trow Friar thou beginnest to dote
who made thee so malapert and so bold,
To come into this Forest here,
among my fallow dear.

Go louse thee ragged knave
if thou make many words I will give thee on ye ear
though I be but a poor Friar
to seek Robin hood I am come here
and to him my heart to break.
thou lousie Friar what would thou with him
he never loved Friar nor none of Friars kin.

Auaunt ragged knave
or ye shall have on the skin.

Of all the men in a morning thou art ye worst
to meet with thee I have no lust,
For he yt meets a friar or a fox in the morning
to speed ill that day he stands in ieopardie
therefore I had rather meet with the devil
Friar I tell thee as I think,
then meet with a friar or a fox
in a morning or I drink.

Auaunt thou ragged knave this is but a mock
if you make many words you shall have a knock,

Hark friar what I say here,
over this water thou shall me bear
the bridge is borne away.

To say thee nay I will not
to let thee of thine oath it were great pity and sin
but upon a Friars back and have even in.

Nay have over.


now am I friar within and thou Robin without,
to lay thee here I have no great doubt:
Now art thou Robin without and I friar within
Lie there knave. choose either sink or swim.

Why thou lousie friar what have thou done


Marry set a knave over the shoon,


Therefore thou shall abye


Why will thou fight a pluck


And God send me good luck,


Then have a stroke for Friar tuck.


Hold thy hand Friar and hear me speak


Say on ragged knave
me seems ye begin to sweat.

In this Forest I have a hound
I will not give him for an hundredth pound:
Give me leave my horn to blow,
that my hound may know.

Blow on ragged knave without any doubt,
until both thine eyes start out:
Here is a sort of ragged knaves come in
Clothed all in kendall green
and to thee they take their way now.

Peradventure they do so


I gave thee leave to blow at thy will,
now give me leave to whistle my sill.

Whistle Friar evil might thou fare,
until both thine eyes stare.

Now cut and Bause,
Bring forth the clubbes and staves
And down with those ragged knaves.

How say thou Friar will thou be my man
to do me the best service thou can,
Thou shall have both gold and fee,
And also here is a lady free I will give her unto thee
And her chaplain I thee make
to serve her for my sake.

Here is a huckle duckle an inch above the buckle
She is a trul of trust to serve a friar at his lust
A pricker, a prauncer, a tearer of sheets,
a wagger of buttocks when other men sleeps,
Go home ye knaves and lay crabs in the fire
for my lady and I will dance in the mire for very pure joy.

Listen my merry men all
and harken what I shall say,
Of an adventure I shall you tell
that befell this other day:
With a proud potter I met
and a rose garland on his head,
the flowers of it shone marvelous fresh
this seven year and more he has used this way
Yet was he never so courteous a potter
as one penny passage to pay.
Is there any of my merry men all
that dare be so bold,
to make the Potter pay passage
either stluer or gold.

Not I master for twenty pound ready told
For there is not amongst us all one that
dare meddle with that potter man for man
I felt his hands not long agon
but I had lever be here by thee,
therefore I know what he is
Meet him when ye will
or meet him when you shall,
He is as proper a man as ever you meddled withal

I will lay with thee little John xx. pound so red
if I with the potter meet
I will make him pay passage mauger his head.

I consent thereto so I eat bread,
If he pay passage mauger his head
twenty pound shall ye have for your meed.

Out alas that ever I saw this day.
For I am clean out of my way:
From Nottingham town,
If I me hie not the faster
Or I come there the market will be done.

Let me see are thy pots whole and sound.


Yea master but they will not break ye ground sake


I will them break-for the cuckold thy masters
And if they will break the ground
thou shall have three pence for a pound.

Out alas what have you done
if my master come he will break your crown

Why thou whoreson art thou here yet
thou should have been at market.

I met with Robin hood a good yeman
He has broken my pottes
and called you Cuckold by your name.

Thou may be a gentleman so God me save,
but thou seem a naughty knave:
Thou call me a cuckold by my name.
And I swear by God and saint John.
Wife had I never none
this cannot I deny
But if thou be a good fellow
I will sell my horse harnes, pots and paniers too
thou shall have the one half and I the other
if thou be not so content thou shall have
stripes if thou were my brother.

Hark potter what I shall say.
this 7. year and more thou have used this way
Yet were thou never so courteous to me
as one penny passage to pay.

Why should I pay passage to thee,


For I am Robin hood chief governor
under the greene-wood tree.

This seven year I used this way up and down
yet paid I passage to no man,
Nor now I will not begin do the worst you can.

Passage shall thou pay here under the greenwoodtree
or else thou shall leave a wed with me:

If thou be a good fellow as men do thee call,
lay away thy bow
And take thy sword and buckler in thy hand
and see what shall befall.

Little John where art thou,

Here master I make auow
I toulde you master so God me save,
that you should find the potter a knave:
Hold your buckler fast in your hand,
and I will stiffely by you stand,
Ready for to fight,
Be the knave never so stout
I shall rap him on the snout,
and put him to flight.
