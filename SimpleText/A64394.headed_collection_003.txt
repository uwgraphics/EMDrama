A Harsh Father enforced his Son Clinia, that was in love
With Antiphila, to go to be a Soldier;
And being sorry for what he had done, he vexed himself.
After he returned, within a while, he went to lodge with Clitipho,
Unwitting to his Father: this Clitipho loved the whore Bacchis.
When Clinia sent for his desired Antiphila,
Bacchis came as his sweat-heart, and Antiphila apparelled
Like a waiting-maid. This was done that Clitipho
Might conceal the matter from his Father. He by Syrus's subtle tricks,
Gets ten Pounds from the old man, to bestow on the Whore.
Antiphila is found to be Clitipho's sister,
Clinia takes her to wise, and Clitipho another woman.
IN militiam proficisci gnatum Cliniam,
Amantem Antiphilam, compulit durus pater:
Animique sese angebat, facti poenitens.
Mox ut reversus est, clam patrem divertitur
Ad Clitiphonem: is amabat scortum Bacchidem.
Cum accerseret cupitam Antiphilam Clinia,
Ut ejus Bacchis venit amica, ac servolae
Habitum gerens Antiphila. Factum id, quo patren
Suum celaret Clitiphilo. Hic technis Syri
December minas meretriculae aufert a seen.
Antiphila Clitiphonis reperitur soror;
Hanc Clinia, aliam Clitipho uxorem accipit.
THat none of you may wonder, why the Poet has allotted
These parts to an old man, which belong unto young men,
I will first tell you that, and afterward I will show you why I came.
This day I am to act a whole Comedy called Heautontimorumenos,
Translated out of a whole Greek one;
Which is become double of a single Subject.
I have showed it to be a new one, and what it is: now, who writ it,
And whose it was in Greek, but that I think the greatest part of you
To know already, I would tell it you.
I will tell you now in few words, wherefore I have learned to act this part;
The Poet was desirous to have me to be an Orator, not a Pro^ogue:
He has appealed to your judgment, he has made me an Actor.
But I wish this Actor could be able to do as much by his eloquence,
As he is able to invent wittily,
Who writ this speech, which I am about to utter.
For whereas ill-willed persons have spread reports abroad,
That he has spoiled many Greek Comedies, whilst he makes
A few Latin ones: He does not deny that he did it,
Neither is he sorry for it, and supposes he may do so again.
He has the example of good men to follow; by which example
He thinks it may be lawful for him to do that which they have done.
Besides, whereas the old ill-willed Poet uses to say,
That he set his mind to Poetry on a sudden,
Presuming on the wit of his friends, not his own inclination:
Your ownjudgment, your own opinion
Shall prevail in the business. Wherefore I would desire you all,
That the speech of partial men may not prevail more with you, then of them
that are impartial
See you prove indifferent. Give them liberty to make more new Comedies,
That grant you liberty to look at them, being
Without mistakes. Let not him think that this is spoken on his behalf,
Who lately made the people to give way to a servant
Running in the street; why should they yield to a mad fellow?
He will tell more concerning his faults, when he shall set out
Other new Comedies, except he give over his railing.
Show your selves indifferent: give me liberty
That I may act a quiet Comedy without noise;
That always a running servant, a testy old man,
A greedy Parasite, and a shameless sycophant,
A covetous bawd, may not be daily acted by an old man
With a very loud speaking, and a great deal of pains.
For my sake, persuade your selves that this is a lawful excuse,
That some of my pains may be eased.
For now adays, they that write new comedies, make no spare of an old man;
If any Comedy be toylsome, they run to me with it;
But if it be easy, it is presently carried to another company.
In this Comedy is a pure style; Try
What my wit can do for one as well as the other:
If I never in a covetous manner set a price of my skill,
And always thought in my mind that that was my greatest gain,
To attend upon your profiting as much as might be possible,
Let me be an example, that young men
May strive rather to please you, than themselves.
NE cui sit vestrum mirum, cur parts seni
Poeta dederit, quae sunt adolescentium,
Id primum dicam: deinde quod veni, cloquar.
Ex integra Graeca integram Comaediam
Hodie sum actuius Heautotimorumenon,
Duplex quae ex argumento facta est simplici.
Novam esse ostendi, and quae esset: nunc, qui scripserit,
Et cuja Graeca sit, ni partem maxumam
Existimarem scire vestrum, id dicerem.
Nunc, quamobrem has parts didicerim, paucls dabo:
Oratorem voluit esse me, non Prologum:
Vestrum judicium fecit; me actorem dedit.
Sed hic actor tantum poterit a facundia,
Quantum ille poterit cogitare commode,
Qui orationem hanc scripsit, quam dicturus sum.
Nam quod rumores distulerunt malevoli,
Multas contaminasse Graecas, dum facit
Paucas Latinas; id esse factum hic non negat,
Neque se id pigere, and deinde facturum autumat.
Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo sibi
Licere id facere, quod illi fecerunt, putat.
Tum quod malevolus vetus Poeta dictitat,
Repent ad studium hunc se applicasse musicum,
Amicum ingenio fretum, hand natura sua:
Arbitrium vestrum, vestra ex^stimatio
Valebit. Quare omnes vos oratos volo,
Ne plus iniquum possit, quam aeqrum oration.
Facite, aequi sitis. Date crescendi copiam
Novarum, qui spectandi faciunt copiam
Sine vitiis. Ne ille pro se dictum existumet,
Qui nuper fecit servo current is in via
Decesse populum, cur insano serviat?
De illius peccatis plura dicet, cum dabit
Alias novas, nisi finem maledictis facit.
Adeste aequ^ animo: date potestatem mihi,
Statariam agere ut liceat per silentium;
Ne semper servus currens, iratus senex,
Edax parasitus, sycophanta autem impudens,
Avarus leno, assidue agendl sint seni
Clamore summo, cum labor maxumo.
Mea causa causam hanc justam esse animum inducite,
Ut aliqua pars laboris minuatur mihi:
Nam nunc novas qui scribunt, nil parcunt seni:
Si qua laboriosa est, ad me curritur:
Sin levis est, ad alium mox defertur gregem.
In hac est pura oration; experimini,
In utramque partem ingenium quid possit meum.
Si nunqnam avare pretium statur arti meae,
Et cum esse quaestum in animum induxi maxumum,
Quam maxume servire vestris commodis,
Exemplum statuite in me, ut adolescentuli
Vobis placere studeant potius quam sibi.
ALthough this acquaintance betwixt us is of very late time,
And hereupon in that you have bought a piece of ground here hard by,
Neither was there indeed almost any matter of occasion, besides;
Yet either your honesty, or your neighborhood,

Causes me boldly and familiarly to advise you,
Because you seem to do otherwise then becomes one of your age,
And otherwise then your estate does advise you to;
For, O wonderful strange! what mean you to do with your self,

Or more then so, as I suppose; no man hoth a better piece of ground
In these parts, nor more worth;
You have a great many servants; and yet as though you had no body,
You your self so diligently supply their office.

So late in an evening, but I epsy you in your ground,
Either digging or plowing, or carrying something. To be short,
You slack no time, nor do you consider your self.
I know very well, that these things are no pleasure to you.

What pains of your own you bestow in working,
If you would spend it in employing them, you would do more good.

Chremes, have you so much leisure srom your own business,
That you can mind other men's, those which do not belong to you?


Imagine I do but admonish you, or ask you a question:
It is lawful that I should do it; it is not to discourage you.

I have need to do thus: Do you do as is needful for you to do.

Is it needful for any man to torment himself?

For me it is.


I pray you? what have you deserved so much of your self?

Alas.

Do not weep, but let me know the matter what ever it is.
Do not keep it in, be not afraid; believe me, I say,
I will help you either by comforting you, or advising, or in the thing it self.



For this reason indeed that I told you.

I will tell you.

But in the mean time lay down
Those boughs, do not work.

By no means.

What do you do?

Let me alone; that I may not afford my self any time
Free from labor.

I say, I will not let you alone.

Ah, you do not do fairly.



Such is my desert.

Now speak.

I have one only son, a young youth;
But what said I, that I have one? Nay, Chremes I had one,
But whether I have one now or not, I am uncertain.

Why so?

You shall know.
There is here a poor old woman a stranger from Corinth,

So as he was just near upon having her to wife. All these things were done
unknown to me
When I came to know it, I began to deal with him
Not in a gentle way, nor as it became the weak mind of a youth,
But by force, and after the common fashion of fathers:

Any longer, whilst I your father am alive,
So as to have a sweetheart now as though she were your wife?
You are mistaken, if you think so, and you do not know me, Clinia.
I am contented you should be called my son so long

I shall find what may be fitting for me to do to you.
That comes of nothing else but too much idleness;
When I was at that age I did not set my mind on wooing
But I went hence into Asia, by reason of poverty, and there

At last the matter came just to this pass; the young youth
Was overcome with hearing the same things often over, and with gries.
He thought that I by reason of my age and good will toward him
Knew more, and would provide better for him, then he could do for himself;
Chremes, into Asia to the King to be a soldier

What soy you?

He went unknown to me, and has been away this three months.

Ye are both too blame; though that enterprise for all this
Is a sign of a bashful mind, and of one that is no coward.

When I understood it by those that were privy to it,

I not knowing what to do for grief, I sat me down:
My servants come running to me, they pull off my shoes;
I see others hasten to lay the table,
And to get ready my supper: every one for his own part did the best he could,

When I saw these things, I began to muse with my self; Alas, are so many
So much trou^led sor my sake only, that they may give me content?
Should so many maids cloth me? Should I alone
Be at so great charges in my house? but my only son

Because that age is more meet to make use of these things,
I have abandoned him hence poor man by my unjust dealing.
Truly I may judge my self worthy of any misery,
If I should do it; for so long as he shall live that poor kind of life,

I will punish my self all the while for his sake,
Working, pinching, seeking sor more, and making my self a slave to him,
And so I do: I leave nothing at all in my house.
Neither vessel, nor suit, I scraped all together.

All except those who by doing husbandry-work
Could easily gain their charges; I set a b^ll presently
Upon my house to be sold; I got together about two thousand pounds.
I bought this parcel of ground, and here I ^mpl^y my self.
Chremes, that I do less wrong to my son,
So long as I undergo mis^rie my self;
And that it is not lawful for me to enjoy any pleasure here,
Till he that should share with me return safe.

I think that you are tenderhearted toward your children;

Well or orderly. But you neither knew him well enough,
Nor he you, this falls out there, where men do not live as they ought.
You never let him see how much you valued him,
Neither durst he commit such things to you, as it is fit for a father to know;


It is so, I confess; I am in the greatest fault of the two.

But Menedemus, I hope it will be well for all this, and I trust, that he
Is well, and will be here shortly with you.

God grant it may be so.

He will grant it; and now if it may be convenient,
Bacchus to day, I would have you be at my house.

I cannot.

Why not? I pray you, spare your self
A little; your son that is away would have you do so.

There is no reason that I who have forced him to pain,
Should now avoid it my self.

Is that your resolution?



Fare you well.

And you too.

He has made me to weep,
And I pity him. But as the time of the day is,
I must put this Phania in mind to come to supper:
I will go see if he be at home. He needed no body
To put him in mind; They say he has been ready a good while

I will go hence in a doors: But why did the door creak?
Who come's hence out ot my house? I will step aside hither.

QUanquam haec inter nos nupera notitia admodum est,
Inde adeo quod agrum in proximo hic mercatus es,
Nec rei fere sane amplius quicquam fuit:
Tamen vel virtus tua me, vel vicinitas,

Facit ut te audacter moneam, and familariter,
Quod videre praeter aetatem tuam
Facere, and praeterquam res te adhortatur tua^
Nam proh Deum atque hominum fidem! qui^ is tibi?

Aut plus eo, ut conjicio; agrum in his regionibus
Mellorem, neque pretii majoris nemo habet;
Servos quam plures: P^oinde quasi nemo siet,
Ita tute attente illorum officia fungere.

Domum revertor, quin te in fundo conspicer
Fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid far. Denique,
Nullum remittis tempus, neque te respicis.
Haec non voluptati tibi esse, satis certe scio.

Quod in opere faciundo operae consumis tuae,
Si sumas in illis exercendis, plus agas.

Chreme, tantumne est ab re tua otii tibi,
Aliena ut cures, ea quae nihil ad te attinent?


Vel me monere hoc, vel percunctari puta;
Rectum est ut ego faciam; non est ut deterream.

Mihi sic est usus. Tibi ut opus est facto, face.

An cuiquam homini est usus, ut se cruciet?

Mihi.


Quaeso? quid de te tantum meruisti?

Eheu.

Ne lachryma, atque istuc quicquid est, fac me ut sciam.
Ne retice; ne verere: creed, inquam, mihi,
Aut consolando, aut consilio, aut re juvero.

Scire hoc vis?

Hac quidem causa qua dixi tibi.

Dicetur.

At istos rastros interea tamen
Depone, ne labora.

Minime.

Quam rem agis?

Sine; vacuum tempus ne quid them mihi
Laboris.

Non sinam, inquam.

Ah, non aequum facis.



Sic meritum est meum.

Nunc loquere.

Filium unicum adolescentulum
Habeo; at, quid dixi, habere me? imo habui, Chreme,
Nunc habeam necne incertum est.

Quid ita istuc?

Scies.
Est e Corintho hic advena anus paupercula,

Prope jam ut pro uxore haberet. Haec clam me omnia.
Ubi id rescivi, coepi non humanitus,
Neque ut animum decuit aegrotum adolescentuli
Tractare; sed vi and via provulgata patrum;

Licere speras facere, me vivo patre
Amicam ut habeas prope jam in uxorisloco?
Erras, si id credis, and me ignoras, Clinia.
Ego te meum esse dici tantisper volo,

Ego, quod me in te sit facere dignum, invenero.
Nulla ad o ex re ist^c fit, nisi ex nimio otio.
Ego istuc aetatis non amori operam dabam,
Sed in Asiam hinc abii propter pauperiem, atque ibi

Postremo adeo res rediit; adolescentulus
Saepe eadem and graviter audiendo victus est.
Putavit me and aetate and benevolent a
Plus scire, and providere quam seipsum sibi.


Quid ais?

Clam me profectus menses ^res abest.

Ambo accusandi: etsi illud incoeptum tamen,
Animi est pudentis signum and non instrenui.

Ubi comperi ex his qui fue^e ei conscii,

Conturbato atque incerto prae a gritud ne, assedi:
Accurrunt servi; soccos detrahunt:
Video alios festinare, lectos sternere,
Coenam apparare; pro se quisque sedulo

Ubi video, haec coepi cogitare; Hem, tot mea
Solius solliciti sunt causa, ut me unum expleant?
Ancillae tot me vestiant? sumptus domi
Tantos ego solus faciam? sed gnatum unicum

Quod illa aetas magis ad haec utenda idonea est,
Eum ego hinc ejeci miscrum injust tia mea.
Malo equidem me dignum quovis deputem,
Si id fa^iam; nam usque dum ille vitam illam incolet

Interea usque illi de me supplicium dabo,
Laborans, parcens, quaerens, illi serviens.
Ita facio: prorsus nihil relinquo in aed bus,
Nec vas, nec vesti mentum: contasi omnia.

Faciundo facile sumptum exercerert suum,
Omnes perduxi ac vendidi: inscripsi illico
Aedes mercede; quasi ad talenta quindecim
Coegi: agrum hunc mercatus sum, hic me exerceo.

Chreme meo gnato facere, dum fiam miser.
Nefas esse ulla me voluptate hic f^ui,
Nisi ubi ille huc salvus redierit meus particeps.

Ingenio te esse in liberos leni puto.

Tractaret. Verum neque tu illum satis noveras,
Nec te ille: hoc ibi fit, ubi vere non vivitur.
Tu illum, nunquam ostendistl, quanti penderes;
Nec tibi ille credere est ausus, quae est aequum patri;


Ita res est fateor; peccatum a me maxumum est.

Menedeme, at porro recte spero, and illum tibi
Salvum, and futurum esse hic confido propediem.

Utinam ita Dii faxint.

Facient; nunc si est commodum,


Non possum.

Cur non? quaeso tandem aliqnantulum Tibi parce: Idem absens facere te hoc vult
filius

Non convenit, qui illum ad laborem impulerim,
Nunc me ipsum fugere.

Siccine est sententia?



Been vale.

Et tu.

Lachrymas excussit mihi.
Miseretque me ejus. Sed ut diei tempus est,
Monere oportet me hunc ad coenam Phaniam
Ut veniat; ibo ut visam si domi est. Nihil opus
Fuit monitore, praesto jamdudum domi

Ibo hinc intro. Sed quid crepuerunt fores?
Hinc a me quisnam egreditur? huc concessero.

THere is no cause yet, Clinia, why you should be afraid; verily they do not
linger
And I know that she will be here for you to day, together with the messenger.
And therefore let go that false thought somness, which so tormenteth you.

Who is my son talking withal?

My father is here, whom I wished for. Father, you come in good time.



Do you know Menedemus ^his neighbor of ours?

Very well.

Do you know that he has a son?

I heard he is in Asia.

He is not father; he is at our house.

What say you?

I brought him to supper, as soon as he came, just as he came from the ship;
For he and I had been acquainted over since we were little children.

You tell me good news. How I could wish that our neighbor Menedemus

At my house; and now it is full time.

Father, take heed how you do it; there is no need.

Why so?

Because as yet he is uncertain what to do with himself: He is but newly come.
He is afraid of every thing; his fathers displeasure, and how his sweetheart
is affected to him
He l^v th her dearly; this ado, and this going away is all long of her.

I know that.

Sy us with him.

What says he?

What? he says that he is in a miserable case.

M^serable! whom
Should one think to be less miserable? What wants he, but he has those things
Which are rcckoned for good in a man, parents, a safe country, friends, stock,
kindred
Riches; and these are indeed just as his mind is that enjoys them.


Nay, but
That old man has been always very unreasonable, and now I fear nothing more,
bu
That his father b^ing angry will do more then is fitting against him.

What he? But
I will refrain my self; for it is good for this my son, that he stand in fear.

What say you with your self?

I will tell you.
How ever the case stood, yet he should have tarried; perhaps his father was a
little more hars

If he will not abide his own father? was it fitting that the father should
live as the son would have him
Or the Son as the Father would have him? and whereas he pretends he is harsh;
it is not so
For Parents injuries are for the most part of one sort; he that is a man but
pretty tolerable
They are loath they should often play the whore-master, they are loath they
should often feast it

But when once the mind has entangled it self with a naughty appetite,
It must needs be, Clitipho, that like resolutions do follow. This is
A known truth, to make trial by others, what may be useful for your self.

I think so.

I will go hence in adoors, that I may see what supper we have.


NIhil est adhuc quod vereare, Clinia; haudquaquam etiam cessant:
Et illam simul cum nuncio tibi hic ego ad futuram hodie, scio.
Proin tu sollicitudinem istam falsam, quae te excruciat, mittas.

Quicum loquitur filius?

Pater adest, quem volui. Pater, opportune advenis.



Hunc Menedemum nostin' vicinum nostrum?

Probe.

Huic filium scis esse?

Audivi esse in Asia.

Non est, pater a pud nos est.

Quid ais?

Advenientem, e navi egre-dientem illico abduxi
Ad coenam, nam mihi cum eo jam inde usque a pueritia semper fuit familiaritas.

Voluptatem magnam nuntias. Quam vellem Menedemum vicinum

Objicerem ^ei, domi! atque etiam nunc tempus est.

Cave faxis, non est opus, pater.

Qua propter?

Quia enim incertum est etiam quid se faciat: modo venit.
Timet omnia, pat: is iram, atque animum amicae se erga ut sit suae.
Eam misere amat, propter eam haec turba atque abitio evenit.

Scio.



Quid narrat?

Quid? ille miserum se esse.

Miserum! quem minus
Credere est? Quid reliqui est, quin habeat, quae quidem esse in homine d^cuntur
Bona, parents, patriam incolumem, amicos, genus, cognatos,
D^vitias? Atque haec perinde sunt ut illius any qui ea possider: 20. Qui uti
scit, ei bona; illi qui non utitur recte, mala

Immo ille fuit
Senex import^nus semper: and nunc nihil magis. Vereor quam ne quid
In illum iratus plus satis faxit pater.

Illene? Sed reprimam me,
Nam in metu esse hunc, illi est utile.

Quid tute to cum?

Dicam.
U^ ut erat, mansum tamen oportu^t: fortasse aliquanto iniquior

Non ferret suum? hunccine erat aequum ex illius more, an illum
Ex hujus vivere? Et quod illum insimulat durum, id non est: nam parentum
Injuriae uniusmodi sunt ferme, paulo qui est homo tolerabilis,
Scortari crebro nolunt, crebro convivarier nolunt,

Verum ubi animus semel se cupiditate se devinxit mala,
Necesse est, Clitipho, consilia copsequi similia. Hoc
Scitum est, periculum ex aliis facere, tibi quod ex usu siet.

Ita credo.

Ego ibo hinc intro, ut videam nobis quid coenae siet.


WHat unequal judges are fathers toward all young men?
Who think it meet that we should presently of children become old-men,
And not be partakers of those things which youth affords?
They measure us according to their desire which they have now, and not which
they had in times past

For a time shall be allowed both to know, and pardon his faults.
I will not do as my Father, who shows me his mind by another person;
I am undone: When he has drunk a little too much, what pranks of his does he
tell
Now he says, Make trial by others, what may be good for your self.

My sweet-hearts sayings do now more move me, Give me, and fetch me;
To whom I have nothing that I can answer, nor is any one in a worse condition:
For this Clinia, although he have work enough of his own to do, yet
He has one that is will and modestly brought up, and that knows not how to
play the whore

Moreover, all that I have to give her, is to say well; for I dare not say I
have nothing
I found this mischief not long ago, and my father does not yet know it.

Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescentes judices?
Qui aequum esse censent jam nos a pueris illico nasci senes,
Neque illarum affines esse rerum quas fert adolescenti^:
Ex sua libidine moderantur nunc quae est, non quae olim fuit.

Nam and cognoscendi and ignoscendi dabitur peccatis locus:
Non ut meus, qui mihi per alium ostendit suam sententiam:
Perii: is ubi adbibit plus paulo, sua quae narrat facinora!
Nunc ait, Periculum ex aliis facito tibi quod ex usu siet.

Magis nunc me amicae dicta stimulant, Da mihi atque affer mihi:
Cui quid respondeam nihil habeo, neque quisquam est miserior.
Nam hic Clinia etsi is quoque suarum rerum satagit, attamen
Habet been and pudice eductam, ignaram artis meretrie^ae.

Tum quod them ei recte est: nam nihil esse mihi religi^ est d^cere.
Hoc ego mali non pr^dem inven^, neque etiam dum scit pater.

IF all things went well with me concerning my love, I know
They would have come long ago; but I fear least the woman be corrupted here,
whilst I was away
Many thoughts come in my head, which may increase my suspicion:
The occasion, the place, her age, her bad Mother under whose command she is,
to who


Clinia.

Woe is me poor man.

Yet take heed that no body coming from your fathers chance to espy you here.

I will. But I do not know what evil my mind for gives me.

Do you go on to judge of that, before you know what truth there is in it?

If there were no harm, they would have been here already.

They will be here by and by.

When will that be?


Whilst they are getting up, and getting ready, it is a years time.

O Clitipho,
I am afraid.

Take heart again; see where Dromo is and Syrus; they are both here together
for you

SIm hi secundae res essent de amore meo, jan dudum scio
Venissent: sed vercor, ne mulier, me abscntc, hic corrupta sit:
Concu^runt multae opiniones, quae mihi animum exaugeant.
Occasio, lo^^s, aetas, matter cujus sub imperio est mala, cui nihil


Clinia.

Hei mise^o mihi,

Etiam cave, ne videat forte hic te a patre aliquis ex^ens.

Faciam, sed nescio quid prof^cto animus praesagit mali.

Pergin' ^stuc prius d^judicare, quam scias quad very siet.

Si nihil mali esset, jam hic adessent.

Jam aderunt

Quando is it c^erit?


Dum moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est.

O Clitipho,
Timeo.

Respira, eccum Dromonem cum Syro! una adsun tibi.

SAy you so?

It is so.

But in the mean time whilst we hold discourse,
They are left behind.

Your woman is here for you; do you hear, Clinia?

I hear indeed now at length, and see her, and am very well, Clitipho.

It is no wonder they are so hindered; they bring a company


I am undone: whence had she those maids?

Do you ask me?

They should not have been left, they bring some things with them.

We is me.

Gold, and clothes; and it groweeh toward night, and they know not the way.
We have done foolishly. Do you, Dromo, step and meet them.
Make haste, why do you loyter?

We is me poor man, how am I fallen short of my hope?



Do you ask what it is?
Do not you see her maids, her gold, her clothes, whom I left here but with one
maid
Whence do you think they are?

Ah, now at length I understand you.

O strange, what a hurry is here! I know our house will scarce he be able to
hold them
What shall they eat? what shall they drink? what will be more miserable then
our old man


O. Jupiter! where is there any truth to be found?
While I wandering up and down like a madman, want my Country sor your sake,
you in the mean tim
Have enriched your self, Antiphila, and for saken me in these misfortunes,
Because of whom I undergo very great disgrace, and am not so dutitifull to my
father as I ought to be
For whose sake I am ashamed, and I pity him, that often told me the conditions
of these whores

Which thing I will now do; I would not do it then when it might have been for
my good
There is no man in a worse case than I.

He is mistaken surely upon our words,
Wh^en we shake here. Clinia, you take your sweetheart to be otherwise then
she is
For her course of life is the same, and her mind is the same as it was toward
you


What is the matter, I beseech you? f^r there is nothing that I would now be
more glad of
Than that I make a false surmiz^ about this matter.

First and fore^ost, that you may not be ignorant os any thing touching this
matter
The old-woman which was heretofore said to be her mother, was not so.


Who is that other woman?

Tarry, Clitipho, I will first tell out my tale which I have begun,
And afterward I will come to that.

Make haste.

Now first of all,
As soon as ever we came at the house. D^ knocked at the door;

She presently got her self here in again; I followed hard after her:
The old-woman bolted the door, and fell to her spinning again.
Hereupon, or no way else, Clinia, it may be known,
In what employment she spent her time, when you was away,

For that thing then gave us an occasion to judge
Of the daily course of her life,
Which does most of all declare every ones disposition how it is.
We found her busily weaving a web,

For that old woman's sake, I suppose, which was dead;
Dressed then without any gold, just as they that are dressed for themselves:
We found her not painted with any ugly matter,
He hair was loose, hanging down, and thrown back


I pray thee, good Syrus,
Do not bring me into a fools Paradise.

The old-woman
Spun the woof, and a little maid besides,
She weaved with her, being all ragged,
Not regarded, nasty with sl^ttish less.

If these things be true Clinia,
As I believe they are, who is more fortunate then you?
Do you know this fluttish and nastie girl that he speaks of?
This also is a great sign that the mistress is faultless,
When they that go her errands to and fro are so much neglected.
For the order is, that they that desire way to the mistresses,


Go on I pray you, and beware you do not labor
To get thanks of me undeserved. What said she, when you named me?

As soon as we told her that you were returned, and entreated her
To come to you, the woman left her web presently,

That you might easily perceive it was done for the love of you.

I know not, I swear, where I am for joy;
I was so afraid.

But I knew there was no cause, Clinia:
Come on again, Syrus, tell me who is that other woman?

Bacchis with us.

How now? what, Bacchis?
Why you rogue, whither do you bring her?

Whither do I bring her? to our house for sooth.

To my father?

To him himself.

O the shameless boldness
Of the fellow!

Do you hear Sir, a great and memorable exploit
Is not done without danger.

Look you to this; you rogue, you go about

Though never so little fail you, I am undone; what will you do with him?

But.

What but?

If you will let me alone, I will tell you.

Let him alone.

I do let him alone.

Thus stands the matter; she as though with.

What
Long tales, with a mischief, does he begin to tell me?

He speaks the truth:


Truly I cannot but speak it,
Clitipho is injurious to me many ways, and he cannot be born withal.

Truly you must hear; hold your peace.

What is the matter?

You desire to love,
You desire to obtain, you desire it may be brought about, that you may have
something to give her, you will not willingly be at any hazard
In enjoying her; you are very wise, if this be to be wise, for you to desire
tha

Or those that are to be foregone with these: Now see whether of these two
proffer
You would rather have; although I know this resolution that I have taken
Is right and safe. For there is liberty for your sweet heart to be with you
At your fathers, without any fear; and then as for the money which you
promised her

Already by entreating me: What else would you have?

If indeed
This be done.

If indeed: you shall know it by making trial.

Well, well, tell me,
That your resolution, what it is.

We will fain his sweetheart to be
Your sweetheart.

Finely done! tell me what shall he do


Nay, she shall be had to your mother.

Why thither?

Clitipho,
It would be too long for me to tell you why I do it: there is cause sufficient.

These are but tales. I see nothing substantial why it is meet for me
To take this sear upon my self.

Stay, I have another trick, if you fear this,


I pray you,
Find some such thing as this.

Yes, I will go hence to meet them,
And bid them return home again.

Ha, what said you?

I will rid you
Of all your fear by and by, that you may rest securely.

What should I do now?

What you? What becomes an honest man.

Syrus, Do but tell me the truth.



She is offered you now, enjoy her whilst you may;
For you know not whether you may have liberty of her hereafter, or never.

Syrus, I say.

Go on and spare not; yet I will do it.

Indeed that is very true, you said,
Syrus; Syrus I say, ho, ho Syrus.

He is very hot, what would you have?

come again, come again.

Here I am, say what is the matter; You will say anon that this does not like
you

Syrus, I commit my self, my love, and my credit to you,
You are the judge, see you be not blameworthy.

It is a fondness,
Clitipho, for you to warn me of this. As if I was not as much concerned in the
matter
As you; If any miscarriage chance to happen to us in this matter,
You shall be chid, but this fellow shall be beaten. Wherefore,

That he would make as though she were his sweet heart.

Yes, For the matter is now come to that point
That I must needs do it.

I love you, and good reason why, Clinia.

But take heed she do not faulter in her speech.

She is taught her lesson very well.
But I wonder at this, how you could so easily persuade her,


I came to her in season which is the chiefest thing of all.
For there I found a wretched soldier, entreating a nights lodging with her.
She dealt cunningly with the fellow, that she might inflame his lustful mind
With the want of her, and that she might be very great in your favor because
of this
But do you hear Sir, have a care that you do not fall on unawares.

How little command you use to have of your self; forbear your speaking the
wrong word first
Your turning your neck aside, your sighing, your spitting,, your coughing, and
laughing

You will commend my behavior.

Have a care.

You your self will wonder at me.

But how soon have the women overtaken us?

Where are they? Why do you hold me?

Now this is none of your sweetheart.

I know that, at my fathers.


Not a jot the mere.

Let (...) alone.

I will not let you alone, I say.

I pray you, a little while.

I forbid you.

At least wise let me salute her.

Get you gone
If you be wise.

I am going, but what must be do?

He shall tarry.

O happy man he!

Walk.

AIn' tu?

Sic est.

Verum interea dum sermones edi^ mus,
Illae sunt relictae.

Mulier tibi adest, audin' Cliniae?

Ego vero audio nunc demum, and video and valeo, Clitipho.

Minime mirum, adeo impeditae sunt; ancillarum gregem


Perii, unde illique sunt ancillae?

Me rogas?

Non oportuit relictas: portant* quid rerum.

Hci mihi.

Aurum, vestem, and vesp^rascit, and non noverunt viam.
Factum a nobis stulte est. Abi dum tu, Dromo, illis obviam.
Propera, quid stas?

Vae misero mihi, quanta de spe decidi!



Rogitas quid siet?
Viden'tu ancillas, aurum, vestem, quam ego cum una ancillula
Hic reliqui; unde esse censes?

Vah, nunc demum intelligo.

Dii boni, quid turbae est? aedes nostrae vix capient scio.
Quid comedent? quid b^bent? quid seen erit n^stro miferius?


O Jupiter, ubinam est fides?
Dum ego propter te errans patria careo demens, tu interea loci,
Collocupletasti, Antiphila, te, and me in his deseruisti malis:
Propter quam in summa infamia sum, and meo patri miru, obsequens:
Cujus nunc pudet me and miseret, qui harum mores cantabat mihi,

Quod tamen nunc faciam; tum cum mihi gratum effe potuit, nolui.
Nemo est miscrior me.

Hic de nostris verbis errat videlicer,
Quae hic sumus loquuti. Clinia, Aliter ^m amorem atque est a^cipis.
Nam and vita est cadem, and animus erga te idem ac fuit,


Quid est, obsecro? nam mihi nunc nihil rerum omnium est,
Quod malim, quam me hic falso suspicarier.

Hoc primum, ut ne quid hujus rei ignores, anus
Quae est dicta matter ei antehac, non fuit.

Dum narrat, forte audivi.

Quaenam est altera?

Mane, hoc quod cepi primum enarrem, Clitipho;
Post istuc veniam.

Propera.

Jam primum omnium,
Ubi ventum ad aedes est, Dromo pultat fores:

Continuo hic se conjecit int^o, ego consequor.
Anus foribus obdit pessulum, ad lanam red^it;
Hic sciri potuit, aut nusquam alibi, Clinia,
Quo st^dio vitam suam te absente exegerit,

Nam ea res dedit tum existumand* copiam
Quotidianae vitae consuetudinem,
Quae cujusque ingenium ut sit declarat maxume.
Texent^m telam st^diose ipsam effendimus,

Ejus an us causa, opinor, quae erat mortus;
Sine auro tum ornatam, ita ut quae ornantur sibi;
N^lla mala re esse expolitam muliebri,
Capillus passus, prolixus, circum capur


Sire mi, obsecro
Ne me in laetitiam frustra conjicias.

Anus
Sub regmen nebat; praeterea una ancillula
Erat, ea texebat una pannis obsita,
Neglecta, immunda illuvie.

Si haec sunt, Clinia,
Vera, ita ut credo, quis te est fortunatior?
Scin' tu hanc quam dicit sordidatam and sordidam?
Magnum hoc quoque signum est dominam esse extra noxiam,
Cum tam negliguntur ejus inter nuncii:
Nam disciplina est, iisdem munerarier


Perge, obsecro te, and cave ne falsam gratiam
Studeas inire: quid ait ubi me nominas?

Ubi dicimus rediisse te, and rogare uti
Veniret ad te, mulier telam deserit

Ut facil e scires desiderio id fieri tuo.

Prae gaudio, ita me Dii ament, ubi sim, nescio:
Ita timui.

At ego nihil esse sciebam, Clinia,
Agedum vicissim, Sire. Dic quae est altera.



Hem! quid? Bacchidem?
Eho, sceleste, quo illam dueis?

Quo illam ego? ad nos scilicet.

Ad patremne?

Ad eum ipsum.

O hominis impudentem
Audaciam!

Heus tu, non fit sine periclo magnum facinus
Et memorabile.

Hoc vide; in mea vita tu tibi

Quid te fugerit, ego perierim. Quid illo facias?

At enim.

Quid enim?

Si finas, dicam.

Sino.

Sino.

Ita res est, haec quasi cum.

Quas malum,
Ambages mihi narrare occipit!

Verum hic dicit,


Enimvero reticere nequeo,
Multis modis injurius Clitipho est, neque ferri potis est.

Audiendum hercle est; tace.

Quid est?

Vis amare;
Vis potiri: vis, quod des illi, effici, Tuum esse in potiundo periculum
Non vis; haud stulte sapis, siquidem id sapere est, relle te id

Aut illa cum his amittenda sunt. Harum duarum conditionum
Nunc utram malis, vide; etsi hoc consilium quod coepi rectum esse
Et tutum scio; nam apud patrem tua amica tecum
Sine metu ut sit, copia est; tum quod illi argentum es pollicitus,

Jam aures reddideras mihi. Quid aliud vis tibi?

Siquidem
Hoc fic.

Siquidem, experiundo scies.

Age, age, cedo
Istud tuum consilium, quid id est?

Adsimulabimus tuam
Amicam hujus esse amicam.

Pulchre, cedo quid hic faciet


Immo, ad tuam matrem deducetur.

Quid eo?

Longum est,
Clitipho, si tibi narrem, quamobrem id faciam: Vera causa est.

Fabulae. Nihil satis firn^i video quamobrem accipere hunc mihi Expediat metum.

Mane, habeo illud, si istuc metuis,


Hujusmodi,
Obsecre, aliquid reperi.

Maxim ibo obviam hinc;
Dicam, ut revertantur domum.

Hem, quid dixti?

Ademptum
Tibi jam faxo omnem metum, in aurem utramvis otiose ut dormias.

Quid ago nunc?

Tune? quod boni est.

Sire, dic modo verum.



Datur modo: fruere dum licet.
Nam nescias ejus sit potestas posth^c an nunquam tibi.

Sire, i^quam.

Perge porro: tamen istuc ago.

Verum herele istuc est.
Sire, Sire, inquam; Heus, heus, Sire.

Concaluit: quid vis?

Redi, redi.

Adsum, dic quid est. Jam hoc quoque negabis tibi placere.


Tu es judex, ne quid accusandus sis, vide.

Ridiculum est
Te me istuc admonere, Clitipho. Quasi istic minor mea res
Agatur quam tua. Hic si quid nobis forte adversi evenerit,
Tibi erunt parata verba, huic homini verbera. Quapropter haec res

Assimulet.

Scilicet, facturum me esse, in eum res jam
Rediit locum, ut sit necesse.

Merito te amo, Clinia.

Verum illa ne quid titubet.

Perdocta est probe.
At hoc demiror, qui tam facile potueris persuadere illi, quae


In tempore ad eam veni, quod rerum omnium est
Primum. Nam miserum quendam offendi ibi militem ejus noctem
Orantem. Haec art tractabat virum, ut illius animum cupidum
Inopia incenderet, eademque ut esset apud te ob hoc quam
Gratissima. Sed heus tu, vide sis ne quid imprudens ruas.

Quam esse soleas impotens. Inversa verba, and versas cervices tuas,
Gemitus, screatus, tusses, risus abstine.

Laudabis.

Vide sis.

Tutemet mirabere.

Sed quam cito sunt consequutae mulieres?

Ubi sunt? cur retines?

Jam nunc haec non est tua.

Scio apud patrem,


Nihilo magis.

Sine.

Non sinam, inquam.

Quaeso paulisper.

Veto.

Saltem salutare.

Abeas,
Si sapis.

Eo, quid istic?

Manebit.

O hominem
Foelicem!

Ambula.

TRuly my Antiphila, I commend you, and deem you Fortunate, seeing you
endeavored that your conditions might be answerable to your beauty
And (I swear) I do not wonder, though every one desire to enjoy you,
For your talk discovered to me of what disposition you are, and when I consider

That you are such as you are, and that we are not. For it stands you in hand
to be honest
They with whom we have to do, will not suffer us. For lovers being taken with
our beaut
Do haunt us; when this is decayed, they turn their minds elsewhere;
Unless we have provided somewhat for our selves in the mean time, we live
forlorn

Very answerable to yours; these apply themselves to you; by this good turn
Ye are so really linked one to another, that never any mishap
Can befall your love.

I know not what other women are, but I know I have always done my best,
That I might do my self good by seeking his good.

Ah, then
Antiphila, you alone bring me back again into my country.
For whilst I was absent from you, I thought all the pains which I undertook
were nothing
But only that I was without your company.

I believe you.

Syrus, I have much ado
To forbear. That I poor man may not do now as it likes my self;

Nay, for as I see your father is disposed, a long while he will deal hardly
with you



Ah, hold me, I pray you.

I pray you, what ail you?

I am undone poor woman.

Antiphila,
Why are you ready to sound.

Do I see Clinia, or no?

Whom do you see?

God save you my dear-heart.

O my long-looked for Clinia, God save you.

How do you?

I am glad that you are come safe home.

Antiphila, whom my heart so much desires?

Get ye in, for the old man has tarried for you a good while.

AE Dipol te, mea Antiphila, laudo, and fortunatam Judico: id cum studuisti
formae ut mores consimiles forent
Minimeque (ita me been Dii ament) miror, si te sibi quisque expetit,
Nam mihi quale ingenium habetes fuit indicio oration, and cum egomet

Vestrarum, vulgus quae ab se segregant; Et vos esse istiusmodi,
Et nos non esse, haud mirabile est. Nam expedit bonas esse vobis,
Nos, quibuscum res est, non sinunt. Quippe forma impulsi nostra nos
Amatores colunt: haec ubi imminuta est, illi suum animum alio
Conferunt: nisi si prospectum est interea aliquid nobis, desertae vivimus.

Est consimilis vestrum; hi se ad vos applicant; hoc beneficio utrique
Ab utrisque ve (...) devincimini, ut nunquam ulla amori vestro incidere
Possit calamitas.

Nescio alias; me quidem semper scio fecisse sedulo,
Ut ex illius commodo meum comparem commodum.

Vah, ergo

Nam dum abs te absum, omnes mihi labores fu ere, quas cepi, leves,
Praeterquam tui carendum quod erat.

Credo.

Sire, vix
Suffero. Hoccine me miserum non licere meo medo ingenio f^ui!

Imo, ut patrem tuum video esse habitum diu, etiam duras dabi^*



Ah, retine me, Obsecro.

Amabo, quid tibi est?

Disperii misera.

Quid
Stupes, Antiphila?

Videon' Cliniam, an non?

Quem
Vides?

Salve, anime mi.

O mi expectate Clinia, Salve.

U^ vales?

Salv^m advenisse gaudeo.



Ite intro, nam vos jamdudum expectat senex.

IT is toward day: Do I forbear to knock at this door
Of my neighbors? that he may first know from me that his son
Is returned, although I know the young man is both to have it so.
But forasmuch as I see this poor man is so much troubled

When there is no danger to him by discovering it?
I will not do it, for I will help the old man as far as I am able,
Just as I see my son to be ready to serve his friend and companion,
And to help him with his attendance in all his business;


Certainly I am either notably born disposed
To misery, or that is not true which I hear to be commonly
Spoken, that Time takes away grief from men;
For my grief concerning my son increases with me daily

He is away, by so much I desire and covet more and more to see him.

But I see him gone out of doors, I will go to him, and speak to him.
Menedemus, God save you, I bring you news
Whereof you desire most especially to be a sharer.

Chremes, Have you heard any thing concerning my son?

He is well, and alive.

Where I pray you?

At home at my house.

My son?

Yes.

Is he come?

For certain.

Is my son
Clinia come?

I told you so.

Let us go, have me to him, I pray you:

He would not have you know that he is returned yet, and he avoideth

Lest your old wonted austerity should be increased.

Did not you tell him, how I was?

No.

Why so, Chremes?

Because you take a very bad course both for him and you in that matter, son
show your self to be so tenderhearted, and easily overcome



Ah
Menedemus, You are too eager both ways,
Either in too much spending or sparing.
You shall fall into the same trap by the one as well as the other.
First, in times past rather then you would suffer your son

And by whom all things were thankfully accepted,
You rated him hence; she being forced whether she would or not
Began to seek a living where she could come by it;
Now when she cannot be had without great loss,

How well she is now fitted to work ones destruction:
First of all, she has brought with her above ten maids
Laden with clothes and gold; if her lover were a Lord,
He could never be able to maintain her charges,


Is she within?

Do you ask, whether she be or not?
I have felt it: For I have bestowed one supper upon her,
And her attendants; but if I were to give them another, I should be undone;
For to let other things pass, what wine has she spent me even now
In sipping, saying thus, This wine is somewhat too harsh,

I have unbroached all my hogs-heads, all my pipes,
I had all my folks bi^sied, and this was but one night,
What do you think will become of you, whom they will daily eat out of house
and harbor
I swear from my heart, I pity your estate,
Menedemus.

Let him do as he lists.
Let him take, let him spend, let him waste, I am resolved ^^ abide it,
So I may but have him with me.

If you be resolved
So to do, I think it will be very requisite for you,
That he may think you give it him unwittingly.



Any thing rather then what you intend;
I would have you give him by any body else, and suffer your self
To be cosened by a servant with his tricks, although that I perceive that also,
That they are about it, and consult of it closely amongst themselves.
Syrus whispereth with that son of yours, and the young men lay their heads
together

This way, then a pound the other way.
We do not now stand about money, but that is we stand about,
How we may let the young man have it with the least peril;
For if he once come to understand your mind,

Lose all your money, then you will let your son go from you,
Fie, what a gap will you lay open for his lewdness?
So as besides you have small comfort of your life;
For we are all of us worse by too much liberty,

Neither will he consider whether it be bad or good which he shall request;
You will never be able to endure your estate and him to be cast away.
You will deny to give him, he will presently run to that
Whereby he shall think himself most able to prevail with you.


You seem to speak the truth, and just as the matter is.

Truly, I have not slept one wink all this night,
Whilst I was musing, how I might help you to your son again.

Give me your right hand; I entreat you further Chremes that you would do this
same thing



Do you know what I would have you do now?

Tell me.

That which you perceive they go about to cosen me of.
That they would make haste to do it; I desire to give him
What he would have; I long now to see him.

I will do my best.
I must take Syrus in hand and persuade him.

Lest they should think that you and I have agreed betwixt our selves;
This little business hinders me; Sinus and Crito
Our neighbors are at a controversy here about their lands.
They have made me an Vmpire betwixt them; I will go and say, as I told you,

I will be here again presently.

I pray you do so: O strange!
That the nature of all men should be so disposed,
That they can better see and judge of other men's things then their own
Comes it hereupon, because in our own affairs

Or gries of mind? How much wiser
Now is this man for me then I am for my self?

I have rid my self srom them, that I might attend you at leisure.

LUcescit; hoc jam cesso pultare ostium
Vicini? primum ex me ut sciat sibi filium
Redisse; etsi adolescentem hoc nolle intelligo;
Verum cum videam miserum hunc tam cruciarier

Cum illi pericli nihil ex indicio siet?
Haud faciam: adjuvabo senem nam quod potero;
Ita ut'filium meum amico atque aequali suo
Video inservire, and servum esse in negotii^:


Aut ego prefecto ingenio egregie ad miseriam
Natus sum, aut illud falsum est quod vulgo audio
Dici, Diem adimere aegritudinem hominibus:
Nam mihi quotidie augescit magis de filio

Abest, magis cupio tanto and magis defidero.

Sed ipsum egressum for as video; ib^, alloquar.
Menedeme, salve, nuncium apporto tibi
Cujus maxume te fieri participem cup^s.



Valet atque vivit.

Ubinam quaeso?

Apud me domi.

Meus gnatus?

Sic est.

Venit?

Cert^.

Clinia
Meus venit?

Dixi.

Eamus; duc me ad eum, obsecro.

Non vult te scire se rediisse etiam, and tuum

Ne tua duritia illa antiqua etiam adaucta siet.

Non tu ei dixisti, ut essem?

Non.

Quamobrem, Chreme?

Quia pessume istuc in te atque in illum consulis,
Si te tam leni and victo esse animo ostenderis.



Ah,
Vehemens in utramque partem, Menedeme, es nimis,
Aut largitate nimia aut parsimonia;
In eandem fraudem ex hac re arque ex illa incides.
Primum olim potius quam pater ere filium

Contenta, euique erant grata omnia,
Perterruisti hinc: ea coacta ingratiis
Post illa coepit victum vulgo quaerere.
Nunc cum sine magno intertrimento non potest

Quam ea nunc instructa pulchre ad perniciem siet,
Primum jam ancillas secum adduxit plus december,
Oner^tas vest atque auro: Satrapes si siet,
Amator, nunquam sufferre ejus sumptus queat,


Estne ea intus?

Sit rogas?
Sensi. Nam unam coenam ei atque ejus comitibus
Dedi; quod si iterum sit danda, actum est.
Nam ut alia omittam, pitissando modo mihi
Quod vini absumpsit? sic, Hoc, dicens, asperum,

Relevi dolia omnia, omnes serias.
Omnes sollicitos habui, atque haec una nox,
Quid te futurum esse censes, quem assidue exederit?
Sic me Dii amabunt, ut me tuarum misertum est,


Faciat, quod lubet,
Sumat, consumat, perdat; decretum est pati,
Dum illum modo habeam m^cum.

Si certum est tibi
Sic facere, illud permagnl refer arbitror,
Ut nescientem sentiat te id sibi dare.



Quidvis potius quam quod cogitas.
Per alium quemvis ut des; falli te sinas
Technis per servulum, ersi subsensi id quoque,
Illos ibi esse, id agere inter se clanculum.
Sy rus cum illo vestro consusurrat; conferunt

Talentum hoc pacto satius est, quam illo minam.
Non nunc de pecunia agitur, sed illud, quo modo
Minimo periculo id demus adolescentulo.
Nam si semel tuum animum ille intellexrit,

Pecuniam omnem, quam abs te amittas filium,
Hui quantam fenestram ad nequitiam parefeceris!
Tibi autem porro ut non sit suave vivere;
Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentia.

Neque id putabit pravum an rectum sit, quod petet.
Tu rem perire and illum, non poteris pati.
Dare denegaris, ibit ad illud illico,
Quo maxim apud re se valere sentiet;


Videre verum, atque ita uti res est, dicere.

Somnum hercle ego hac nocte oculis non vidi meis,
Dum id quaero, tibi qui filium restituerim.

Cedo dextram; porro te oro idem ut facias, Chreme.



Scin', quid nunc facere te volo?

Dic.

Quod sensisti illos me incipere fallere,
Id ut maturent facere; cupio illi dare,
Quod vult: cupio ipsum jam videre.

Operam dabe.
Syrus est prehendendus, atque adhortandus mihi.

Ne nos inter nos congruere sentiant.
Paulum hoc negoti mihi obstat: Sinus, and Crito
Vicini nostri hic ambigunt de finibus.
Me cepere arbitrum; ibo ac dicam, ut dixeram,

Continuo hic adero.

Ita quaeso. Dii vostram fidem!
Itan' comparatam esse hominum naturam omnium
Aliena vt melius videant and judicent, quam sua?

Perpediti nimio, aut aegritudine? Hic mihi,
Nunc quanto plus sapit, quam egomet mihi?

Dissolvi me, otiosus ut operam tibi darem.

RVn about this way and that way, yet I must find
Money, I must devise some trick for the old man.

I was not mistaken, that they were plotting about it, now verily
That same servant of Clinia's is a dullard,


Who talks here? I am undone. Has he heard these words?

Syrus.

Ha.

What do you there?

Truly Chremes I much wonder at you,
That you are up so early, who drunk so much yesterday.

Nothing too much.

Nothing say you! me thought as folks use to say,


No more of that.

This where is a pleasant and
Merry-conceited woman.

So she seemed indeed to me.

And truly of a clear complexion.

So and so.

Not so good as it was in times past, but as it is at this present.
And I do not wonder that Clinia is deep in love with her:

This neighbor of ours; do not you know him? And as if he had
Not means enough, his son for sook his country for want.
Do you know it to be done as I say?

Why should I but know?
A fellow that deserves the house of correction.

Whom do you mean?

I mean


O Syrus, I was cursedly afraid for *you.

Who suffered that thing to be done.

What should he have done?

Do you ask?
He should have found out some shift, and have devised wily tricks,
Whereby the young man might have somewhat to bestow on his sweetheart,
And might have saved this old man against his will, that is so hard to please.



Syrus, these things ought to have been done by him.

Why, I pray you, do you commend those that deceive their masters?

In season
Truly I commend them.

Very well indeed.

Because
That is sometimes a remedy os great inconveniences.
Now his only son might have remained at home to this man.


But indeed he gives me encouragement, that I may have more mind to do it.

And now, Syrus, what does he wait for? what whilst he go away
Hence again, seeing he cannot be able to bear her charges,
Does he not invent some cunning-trick to put upon the old man?

He a blockhead.


Truly I can soon do it, if you but say the word;
For I know very well, how it is wont to be done.

Verily you are so much the fitter man.

I am not used to dissemble.

Do it then.

But do you hear, be sure you remember these same things,
If any thing of this nature chance to befall at any time,
As humane things are casual, that your son should do the like.

It will not come to pass, I hope.

Truly I hope so too,
Nor do I speak it now therefore, because I perceived him go about any such
thing
But if he should do any such thing, that you may not be angry at me; you see
what his age is
Chremes, if need should be, I could handle you gallantly.

We will consider concerning that matter when occasion shall serve,
What shall be needful. Now mind what you have in hand.

I never heard my master speak more opportunely then now.
Nor when I went about to do a mischief, did I think


HAc illac circumcursa, inveniendum tamen
Argentum, intendenda in senem est fallacia.

Non me fesellit hosce id struere, videlicet
Ille Cliniae servus tardiusculus est,


Quis hic loquitur? perii. Numnam haec audivit?

Sire.

Hem!

Quid tu is it ic?

Recte quidem te demiror, Chreme;
Tam mane, qui heri tantum b^beris.

Nihil nimis.

Nihil narras? visa vero est, quod dici solet,


Eja.

Mulier commoda and
Faceta haec est meretrix.

Sane idem vifa est mihi.

Et quidem hercle forma luculenta.

Sie satis.

Ita non ut olim, sed uti nunc sane, bona.
Minimeque miror; Glinia hanc si deperit.

Vicinum hunc, nostin? and quafi is non divitiis
Abundet, natus ejus profugit inopia;
Scin' esse factum ut dico?

Quid ego nesciam?
Hominem pistrino dignum.

Quem?

Istunc servulum


Sire, tibi timui male.

Qui passus est id fieri?

Quid faceret?

Rogas?
Aliquid reperiret, fingeret fallacias,
Unde esset adolescenti amicae quod daret,
Atque hunc difficilem invitum servaret senem.



Haec facta ab illo oportebant, Sire.

Eho, quaeso, laudas qui heroes fallunt.

In loco
Ego vero laudo.

Recte sane.

Quippe quia
Magnarum saepe aegritudinum id remedium est,
Jam huic mansisset unicus gnatus domi.


Nisi mihi qaidem addit animum, quo lubeat magis,

Et nunc quid expectat, Sire? an dum hinc denuo
Abeat, cum tolerare hujus sumptus non queat?
Nonne ad senem aliquam fabricam fingit?

Stolidus est,

Causa.

Facile quidem facere possum, si jubes:
Etenim quo pacto id fieri soleat, calleo.

Tanto hercle melior.

Non est mentiri meum.

Fac ergo.

At, heus tu, facito eadem haec memineris,
Si quid hujus simile, forte aliquand^ evenerit,
Ut sunt humana, tuus ut faciat filius.

Non usus veniet, spero.

Spero hercle ego quoque.
Neque eo nunc dico, quo quicquam illum senserim:
Sed si quid, nequid quae sit ejus aetas vides.

Tractare possim.

De istoc, cum usus venerit,
Videbimus quid opus sit; nunc istuc age.

Nunquam commodius unquam herum audiviloqui.
Nec, cum malefacerem, crederem mihi impunius


WHat is that I pray you? what behavior is that, Clitipho?
Is it fitting to do so?

What have I done?

Did not I see you just now,
Put your hand into that whores bosom?

The matter is dashed, I am undone.

What me?

With these eyes.

That you cannot hold your hands? For indeed this is
A gross abuse, to entertain a man that is your friend
With you, and to busy your self with his sweetheart: even yesterday in your
win
How immodest were you?

He was so.

How trouble some?

I know the mind of lovers, they take things in dudgeon
Which you would not imagine.

But he dare credit me,
Fathers that I will do no such matter.

Be it so; yet indeed
You should have gone somewhither a while out of their sight. Love

By my self. There is none of my friends at this day, Clitipho,
To whom I dare disclose all my secrets.
His worth hinders with one, with another it ir^eth me
Of what is done, lest I should seem to be foolish or saucie, which suppose him
to do


What is he telling?

I am undone.

Clitipho, I discharging the duty
Of an honest and moderate person, do advise you these things.

Hold your peace, I pray you.

Very well indeed.

Syrus, I am ashamed.

I believe you, and not without cause; for it troubles me.

Do you go on


I speak the truth, what I think.

Should I not come
At them?

Why I pray you, is there but one way to come at them?

But he will first bewray him self, before I get the money.
Chromes, Will you hearken to me a foolish fellow?

What Shall I do?

^id this man go some whither hence.

Whither should I go


Whither you list. Give them place. Go walk.

Walk, whither?

Fie, as if you wanted a place.
Go forsooth this way, or that way, whither you will.

He says well
I suppose.

Syrus, an ill end come to thee
That thrustest me thence.

But do you hold those hands hereafter.
Chremes, he will do further,
Unless you observe, chastise, and admonish him, as far as God will enable you.

I will look to that.

But master, you must now look to him.

It shall be done.

If you be wise, for he regards me less and less.

Syrus, What say you? Have you done any thing about that matter, of which I
spoke to you a while ago
Or have you found any thing that likes you, or not yet at all?

(...) you speak
About the trick? whilst I have found one lately.

You are an honest fellow, tell me what it is.

I will tell you, but as one thing fell out after another.

What is it Syrus?

This is a very naughty whore.

So she seems.

Nay, if you knew all.
See this prank which she begins to play. There was an old woman of Corinth
here


What then? She died and left behind her a young daughter,
She was left as a pawn to this whore for that money.

I underderstand you.

She has brought her with her, and she is now with your wife.

What then?

Clinia entreats her to bestow her on him, and yet desires to give her


And will be indeed desire it?

Whoo, is that any question?

I thought so; what do you now think to do?

What I? I will go to Menedemus, and tell him she was bought from Caria,
Being rich, and a gentlewoman; if he will buy her again, much gain is to be
got by her

You are mistaken.

Why so?

I will now answer you for Menedemus.


Speak as one would have you.

But there is no need.

Is there no need?

No indeed.

Why say you so? I wonder.

You shall know by and by* Tarry, tarry; what is the matter,
That our door creaks so much?

QUid istuc, quaeso? qui istic mos est Clitipho?
Itane fieri oportet?

Quid ego feci?

Vid^n' ego te mod^
Manum in sinum huic meretrici ins^rere?

Acta haec res est, perii.

Mean?

Hisce oculis:

Illi, qui non abstaneas manum? nam istaec quidem
Contumelia est, hominem amicum recipere
Ad te, atque ejus amicam subagitare; Vel heri in vino
Quam immodestus fuisti?

Factum est.

Quam molestus?

Esset. Novi ego amantium animum, advortunt graviter,
Quae non censeas.

At mihi fides apud hunc est,
Nihil me istius facturum, pater.

Esto; at oerte
Coneedas aliquo ab ore ^orum aliquantisper. Multa fert

Apud alium prohibet dignitas, apud alium ipsius facti Piget, ne ineptus, ne
protervus videar: quod illum facere credito


Quid istic narrat?

Perii.

Clitipho, haec ego
Praecipio tibi, hominis frugi and temperantis functus officio.

Tace, sodes.

Recte sane.

Sire, pudet me.

Credo, neque id injuria; quin mihi molestum est.

Pergin'


Verum dico, quod videtur.

Nonne accedam
Ad illos?

Eho, quaeso, una accedendi via est.

Atenim hic prius se indicaverit, quam ego argentum effero.
Chreme, vin'tu homini stulto mihi auscultare?

Quid Faciam?

J^be hunc abire hinc aliquo.

Quo ego hinc


Quo lubet. Da illis locum. Abi deambulatum.

Deambulatum? quo?

Vah, quasi desit locus.
Abi, sane, istac, istorsum, quo vis.

Recte dicit,
Censeo.

Dii te eradicent, Sire, qui me istinc
Extrudis.

At tu tibi istas posthac comprimito manus.

Nisi eum, quantum tibi op^s Dii dant, servas, castigas, mones?

Ego istuc curabo.

Atqui nunc, here, tibi adservandus est.

Fiet.

Si sapias; nam mihi jam minus minusque obtemperat.

Quid tu? ecquid de illo, quod dudum tecum egi, egistin', Sire?
Aut reperisti tibi quod placeat, an nondum etiam?

De fallacia
Dicis? est, inveni quandam nuper.

Frugies; cedo quid id est?

Dicam, verum ut aliud ex alio incidit.

Quidnam, Sire?

Pessima haec est meretrix.

Ita videtur.

Immo, si scias.
Hoc vide quod inceptat facinus. Fuit quaedam anus Corinthia hic;


Quid tum?

Ea mortua est: reliquit filiam adolescentulam,
Ea relicta huic arraboni est pro illo argento.

Intelligo.

Hanc secum huc adduxit, eaque est nunc ad uxorem tuam.

Quid tum?

Clinia orat sibi uti nunc det illam; illi tamen post daturum mill
(...). Nummum poscit.

Et pos^it quidem?

Hui, dubiumne
Id est?

Ego sic putavi. Quid nunc facere cogitas?

Egone? ad Menedemum ibo: dicam hanc esse captam ex Caria,
Ditem and nobilem; fi redimat, magnum in ea esse lucrum.

Erras.

Quid ita?

Pro Menedemo ego nunc tibi


Op^ata loquere.

Atqui non est opus.

Non opus est?

Non hercle vero.

Qui istuc? miror.

Jam scies. Mane, mane; quid est, quod tam.
A nobis graviter crepuere fores?

UNless I be deceived, surely this is the ring, which I suppose it to be. That
with which my daughter was exposed with

Syrus, what means this talk?

What is it? Do not you think it
To be it?

Truly I told you presently, as soon as you showed it me,


But be sure that you now look well upon it,
My nurse.

I have viewed it sufficiently.

Now go your way in, and if she
Have already washed, bring me word. In the mean time I will tarry for my
husband here

She would speak with you, you may see what she would have: I know not why she
is sad
There Is some occasion: I fear what the matter should be.

What should it be? truly she


O ho, my husband.

O ho, my wife.

I am looking for you.

Speak, what
You would have.

First, I entreat you that you would not think
That I durst do any thing contrary to your command.

Would you have me
Believe you this, though it be a thing not to be believed? I believe you.

I know not


Do you not remember that I was with child,
And that you gave me very strict charge, that if I had a girl I should not
Bring it up?

I know what you have done, you have brought it up.

Have you done so?
Then, mistress, my master has received damage.

Not so,
But there was here an old woman of Corinth, an honest woman, I gave her to be
cast forth

Jupiter, that you should be so void of wit!

I am undone.
What have I done?

But do you ask?

I have done amiss, my Chremes,
I have done it unwittingly.

I know that for certain, though you should say say to it,
That you both say and do all things unwittingly and unadvisedly;
You discover so many faults in this matter. For first now* if you would have
don

In words, and given her hope of life in very deed. But I pass by that; that
was but pity
And a motherly mind, I bear with it. But how well have you look to it? what
did you intend
Consider with your self, your daughter forsooth is most manifestly betrayed to
that old woman
By you, either to turn whore, or to be sold publicly. I think this was

That know neither right nor reason, what is fitting? be a thing better or
worse
Be it for them, or against them, they regard nothing but what they list.

My Chremes,
I confess, I have offended, I am confuted; now I entreat you this, by how much
mor
Experienced your mind is, and more inclinable to pardon, that your equity


Yes indeed
I will pardon that fault. But Sostrata, my gentleness does badly teach you
Many things. But what ever it be, speak, wherefore it was begun.

As we foolish and sorry women are all superstitious; when I gave her to her to
be exposed
I plucked the ring from off my finger, and bade her expose it with the girl;


That is very well, you both saved your self and her.

This is that ring:

Whence had you it?

Of the young woman which Bacchis brought with her.

What now?

What does she say?

She whilst she went to wash her,
Gave me the ring to keep. I did not mind it at first, but after I looked upon
it, I knew it presently


What now do you conjecture or find concerning her?

I know not, but you may ask of her, whence she had it, if she may
Be found.

I am undone, I see more hope then I would; she is ours, if it be so.

Is she alive to whom you gave her?

I know not.

What did she say
She did heretofore?

That which I bade her.

Tell me what was the name


Philtere.

That is she, it is a wonder
If she be not safe, and I undone.

Sostrata, follow me in this way.

How is it fallen out beyond my expectation! how greatly feared I, lest you
should b
As hard-hearted now, as you was heretofore, Chremes, about bringing her up!

A man may not be
Oftentimes as he would, if the matter do not permit. Now so is the time with
me that I desir


Unless I be deceived, an ill turn is not far off me,
My forces are now quite driven into such a narrow strait,
Except I find out some trick, that the old may not know this is his sons
sweetheart
For there is nothing for me to hope on about getting the money, or that I
should desir
To deceive the old man; I shall be glad if I may get away with a whole skin.

What should I do? or what shall I devise? I must begin to reckon anew;
There is nothing so hard, but by searching it may be found out.
What if I should begin this thus? it is to no purpose. What if thus? I shall
do all one
But I think it may be thus: it cannot be; Yes, very well; O brave! I have a
very fine way
Truly I suppose I shall for all this draw into my fingers that same money
which is apt to be gone.

Quid ego feci?

Atrogitas?

Si peccavi, mi Chremes,
Insciens feci.

Id quidem ego, etsi tu neges, certe scio,
Te inscientem atque imprudentem dicere ac facere omnia.
Tot peccata in hac re ostendis. Nam jam primum si meum imperium

Verbis, re ipsa spem vitae dare; at id omitto; miscricord^a,

Cogita: nempe anui illi prodita abs te filia est planissime,
Per te; vel uti quaestum faceret, vel uti veniret palam. Credo id

Qui neque, jus, neque bonum atque aequum sciunt? melius, pejus;
Prosit, obsit; nihil vident, nisi quod lubet.

Mi Chreme,
Peccavi, fateor, vincor; nunc hoc te obsecro, quanto tuus est
Animus natu gravior, ignoscentior, ut meae stultitiae


Scilicet equidem
Istuc factum ignoscam. Verum, Sostrata, male docet te mea facilitas
Multa. Sed istud quicquid est, qua hoc occeptum causa est, loquere.

Ut stultae and miserae omnes sumus religiosae; cum exponendam do
Illi, de digito annulum detraho, and cum dico ut una cum puella


Istuc recte, conservasti te atque illam.

Hic is est annulu^.

Unde habes?

Quam Bacchis secum adduxit adolescentulam.

Hem!

Quid ea narrat?

Ea lavatum dum it, servandum mihi
Dedit annulum. Non advorti primo; sed postquam aspexi, illico cognovi.


Quid nunc suspicare, aut invenis de illa?

Nescio, nisi ut ex ipsa quaeras, unde hunc habuerit, si potis est
Reperiri.

Interii, plus spei video quam volo; nostra est, si ita est;

Vivitne illa, cui tu dederas?

Nescio.

Ipsa est; mirum, ni
Illa salva est, and ego perii.

Sostrata, sequere intro hac.

Ut praeter spem evenit! quam timui male, ne nunc animo ita esses duro,
Ut olim in tollenda, Chreme!

Non licet hominem esse saepe
Ita ut vult, si res non sinit. Nunc ita tempus est mihi ut cupiam filiam, olim


Nisi me animus fall^t, haud multum a me aberit infortunium,
Ita hercle in angustum oppido nunc meae coguntur copiae:
Nisi aliquid video, ne esse amicam hanc gnati resciscat senex.
Nam quod de argento sperem, aut posse postulem, me fallere,
Nihil est; triumpho, si licet me latere tecto abscedere

Quid agam? aut quid comminiscar? ratio de integro ineunda est mihi.
Nihil tam difficile est, quin quaerendo investigari possiet.
Quid si hoc sic incipi^m? nihil est; fi sic? tantundem egero.
At sic opinor: non potest; immo, optume; euge, optumam habeo.
Retraham hercle opinor ad me idem illud fu gitivum argentum tamen.

NOthing hereafter can happen to me so weighty, which May cause me any grief;
this so great joy has befallen me
I now yield my self to my father, to become more thrifty then he would have me.

The matter has not deceived me, as far as I hear by his words.


O my Syrus, have you heard I pray you?

What else, who was continually with them?

To whom did you ever hear any thing happen so well?

To ^^ man.

And I swear, I am not so much glad for my own sake,
As for hers, whom I know to deserve all the respect that may be.

Clinia, go to, let me have your help again.
For your friends business must also be looked to, that it may be made safe:
Lest the old man should now perceive any thing about the love.

O Jupiter!

Be quiet.

My Antiphila shall be married to me.

Do you so interrupt me in my speech!

What shall I do, my Syrus? I am glad: bear with me.

I do bear with you, but indeed.



I suppose, I bestow my labor in vain.

Speak; I hear you.

But you will not now hear me this.

I will do it.

I say, Clinia, you must have a care of your friends business that it be made
safe
For if you now go away from our house, and leave Bacchis here, the old man
will kno
Presently that she is Clitipho's sweetheart; but if you have her away, it
will be conceal
So as it has been hitherto.

But Syrus, there is nothing more
Against my marriage; for with what face shall I speak to my father?
Do you understand what I should say?

What else?

What should I say? what excuse
Shall I make?

What? I would not have you lie; tell him plainly
How the matter is.

What say you?

I charge you, tell him that you
Clilipho's sweetheart.

You command me
A very honest and just thing, and easy to be done; and forsooth
You would now have me entreat my father this, that he would conceal it from
your old man

Nay, I would have him tell all the matter downright in order.

Ha,
Are you well in your wits, and not drunk? Truly you go the way to undo him
quite; for ho


Indeed I think this course
The best; herein I gallantly vaunt my self, that have so great power
In me, and ability of such craft, as that by telling the truth
I can deceive them both; that when our old man tells yours that she is
His sons sweetheart, he may not believe it for all that.

But by this means

That she is my sweetheart, he will not adventure his daughter. You perhaps,
Make small reckoning what shall become of me, so you may shift for him.

What
With a mischief, do you think I desire it to be dissembled long? its but for
one day
Till I get the money, and no more.

Do you account so much enough?

As they that say, What if the sky should fall now?

I am afraid
What to do.

Are you afraid? as if it were not in your own power
To acquit your self what time you list, and make the matter manifest.

Cui aeque audisti commode quicquam evenisse?

Atque ita me Dii ament, ut ego nunc non tam meapte causa

Frustra operam, opinor sumo.

Loquere, audio.

At jam hoc non audies.

Agam.

Vid^ndum, inquam, amici quoque res, Clinia, tui in tuto ut collocetur:
Nam si nunc a nobis abis, and Bacchidem hic relinquis, senex rescisscet
Illico esse amicam hanc Clitiphonis: si adduxeris, celabitur
Itidem, ut celata est adhuc.

Quo velis in tempore ut te exsolvas, rem facias palam.

Age, age, traducatur Bacchis.

Optum^, ipsa exit fo^as.

TRuly, Syrus's his promises have saucily enough brought me hither
For the ten pounds which be promised me. But if he shall now
D^ceive me, he shall come in vain, often entreating me to come.
Or when I shall have told him, and appointed that I will come, when he
Clitipho shall then hang in hope,
I will deceive him and not come; I shall make Syrus's back to smart for it.

She promises you pretty well. But do you think she jesteth?
She will do it, except I take heed.

They are asleep, but indeed
I will rouse them. My Phrygia, did you not hear even now, what country house
Charinus's that fellow showed us?

I heard him.

He said it was next
To this ground on the right hand.

I remember it.

Run
Apact; the soldier keeps with him a feast to Bacchus.

Why does she begin these things?

Tell him, that I am here sore against my will, and that I am kept perforce,
But that I will deceive them one way or other, and will come.

Bacchis, tarry, tarry; whither do you send that maid, I pray you?
Bid her tarry.

Go your way.

But the money is ready.

But I tarry here.

But it shall be given you by and by.

As you please; do I urge you?

But I pray you, know you not what you are to do?

What?

You must now step, over to Menedemus house, and all your train,
Must be brought over thither.

What do you do, you rogue?

What I? I am coining the money.
Which I must give you.

Do you think me fit to make a fool on?

It is not for nothing.

What have you any thing to do with me here?

No, I will but give you your own.

Let us go.

Follow me this way. Ho Dromo.

Who would have any thing with me?

Syrus.

What is the matter? Bring over all Bacchis maids hither to your house quickly.

Why so?

Do not stand to ask.
And let them bring what things they brought with them hither. The old man will
hop

This little gain may bring him. You know not what you do know,
D^omo, if you be wise.

You shall tell them, I will be as mute as a Fish.

SAtis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc adduxerunt,
December minas quas mihi pollicitus est. Quod si nunc me
Deceperit, ^aepe obsecrans me ut ut veniam, frustra veniet:
Aut cum venturam dixero and constituero, cum is certe

Decipiam ac non veniam; Syrus mihi tergo paenas pendet.

Satis site promittit tibi.

Atqui tu hanc jocari credis?
Faciet, nisi caveo.

Dormiunt; ego pol istos
Commovebo. Mea Phrygia, and istin modo iste homo quam villam


Audivi.

Proxumam esse
Huic fundo ad dextram?

Memini.

Curriculo
Percurre: apud eum miles Dionysia agitat.

Quid haec inceptat?

Dic me hic oppido esse invitam, atque asservari:


Perii hercle: Bacchis mane, mane; quo mittis istam nunc quaeso?
Jube, maneat.

Abi.

Quin est paratum argentum.

Quin ego hic maneo.

Atqui jam dabitur.

Ut lubet, number ego insto?

At scin, quid sodes facias?

Quid?

Transeundum nunc tibi ad Menedemum est, and tua pompa
Eo traducenda est.

Quam rem agis, scelus?

Egon'? argentum cudo,
Quod tibi them.

Dignam me putas, quam illudas?

(...) est temere.

Etiamne tecum hic res mihi est?

^inime, tuum tibi reddo.

Eatur.

Sequere me hac. Heus Dromo.

Quis me vult?

Syrus.

Quid est rei?

Ancillas omnes Bacchidis
Traduce huc ad vos propere.

Quam ob rem?

Ne quaeras.

Levatum esse harum abitu. Nae, ille haud scit hoc paululum lucri,
Quantum ei damni apportet. Tu nescis id quod scis,
Dromo, si sapies.

Mutum dices.

I Swear, I pity Menedemus's hap,
That so much mischief has befallen him,
As to maintain that woman with all her family,
Though I know he will not be sensible of it these two or three days,

But when he shall see that he shall be daily at such charges
In housekeeping, and that there will be no mean,
He will wish again that his son were gone from him.
I see Syrus in good time, Lo where he is.

Do I make no haste to set on him?

Syrus.

Ha.



I wished long ago to have met with you.

Me thinks you have been doing something now with the old man,
I know not what.

Do you mean about that which you spoke of ere-while? I fully dista^ched it.

What in good earnest?

In good earnest truly.

I cannot forbear,
But I must stroke thy bead. Come hither to me, Syrus,


But if you knew how prettily it came into my mind.

Fie do you brag, that it fell out according to your mind?

No, indeed, I tell you the truth.

Tell me what it is.

Cli^i^ told Menedemus that this Bacchis
Clitipho's sweetheart, and that he brought her with him
For that reason, for fear you should fully perceive it.

Very well.

Speak in good sooth.

I say it is too too well.

Yes, so far well enough.
But bear further, what bravery remains;
He will tell you that himself saw your daughter,


Her,
And that he would fain have her to wife.

Does he mean her which was found erewhile?
And he will bid that she be required.

Why say you that Syrus?
For I understand nothing at all.

Tush, you are a dullard.

Perhaps so.

He shall have money given him for the marriage,


Let him get it.

That same is it.

But I will neither give nor promise her to him.

No? why?

Do you ask me why? to a fellow?

Do as you list.

ITa me Dii amabunt, ut nunc Menedemi vicem
Miseret me, tantum devenisse ad cum mali,
Illancine mulierem alere cum illa familia,
Etsi scio hosce aliquot dies non sentiet,

Verum ubi videbit tantos sibi sumptus domi
Quotidianos fieri, nec fieri modum,
Optabit rursum ut abeat ab se filius.
Syrum optume, eccum.

Cesso hunc adoriri?

Sire.

Hem,



Te mihi ipsum jamdudum exoptabam dari.

Videre egisse jam nescio quid cum seen.

De illo quod dudum? dictum ac factum reddidi.

Bonane fide?

Bona hercle.

Non possum pati
Quin tibi caput demmulceam. Accede huc, Sire,


At si scias, quam site in mentem venerit.

Vah, gloriare evenisse ex sententia?

Non hercle vero, verum dico.

Dic quid est.

Tui Clitiphonis esse amicam hanc Bacchidem

Secum adduxisse, ne tu id persentisceres.

Probe.

Dic sodes.

Nimium inquam.

Imo sic satis.
Sed porro ausculta quod superest fallaciae,
Sese ipse dicet tuam vidisse filiam,

Hanc se cupere uxorem.

Modone quae inventa est?

Eam.
Et quidem jubebit posci.

Quamobrem istuc, Sire?
Nam prorsus nihil intelligo.

Hui, tardus es.

Fortasse.

Argentum dabitur ei ad nuptias;


Comparet.

Id ipsum.

At ego illi nec do nec despondeo.

Non, quamobrem?

Quamobrem me rogas? homini?

Ut lubet.
